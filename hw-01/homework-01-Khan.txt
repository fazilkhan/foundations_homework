3. 120 lines. Used “grep 2017 OSHA\ fatalities\ FY2017.csv > 2017accidents.txt” command to create a new file of 2017 accidents. Then used “wc-l 2017accidents.txt” command to calculate the number of lines in that file.

4. head -n 1 OSHA\ fatalities\ FY2017.csv

5. 12 accidents involved forklifts. Created a separate file with “grep forklift OSHA\ fatalities\ FY2017.csv > forkliftaccidents.txt” command. Could have also done through "grep forklift OSHA\ fatalities\ FY2017.csv | wc -l" command just want to know the number of accidents.
