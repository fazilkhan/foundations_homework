3/2/21,Rep. Raskin's February in Review,"March 2, 2021	Dear Neighbor:	I wanted to take a moment to share with you a brief update about how my staff and I have been working for the people of the 8th District. It is a surpassing honor to continue serving as your Representative in Congress.	As always, I encourage all 8th District residents to¬†connect with me on¬†¬†Facebook,¬†Twitter, or¬†Instagram.¬†		Stay close,			Celebrating Black History Month		As the nation celebrated Black History Month,¬†I was honored to recognize¬†Shirl Spicer,¬†Montgomery Parks'¬†Museum Manager, and David Key, President of the African American Resources-Cultural Heritage (AARCH) Society of Frederick County, as our 8th District Local Heroes.¬†	Click here to learn more about Shirl's work¬†overseeing the Josiah Henson Museum restoration and bringing to life African-American history across Maryland.	Click here to learn more about David and AARCH's effort to¬†build a vibrant Heritage Center to tell the amazing but unsung story of Frederick‚Äôs African-American community.¬†	Calling for Vaccine Equity	African-Americans make up 31% of our population in Maryland but make up more than 35% of our COVID-19 deaths. I'm committed to doing everything I can to improve vaccine equity and overcome vaccine hesitancy in communities of color. Click here to watch my Q&A with the expert witnesses who testified in our Coronavirus Oversight Select Subcommittee hearing about equity in coronavirus vaccinations.	Fighting for Federal Workers		I'm proud to represent tens of thousands of federal employees who live and work in the 8th District. In our Oversight hearing about revitalizing the federal workforce, I argued that the federal government must be an instrument of the common good, not self-enrichment, and Congress must protect federal workers. You can click here to watch my hearing remarks on the importance of restoring the civil service.	Launching the 2021 Congressional Art Competition	I was thrilled to announce¬†the launch of our 2021 Congressional Art Competition for 8th District high school students! Entries must be submitted digitally by 5pm on Monday, April 12th. More than 120 students from 16 high schools across the District participated in last year‚Äôs competition and I'm looking forward¬†to seeing all of the amazing artwork from this year's student artists. Visit my website for more information about how to participate and observe.¬†	Examining U.S. Postal Service Delays	In our Oversight Committee hearing about the USPS, I asked Postmaster General Louis DeJoy how his illogical plan to eliminate first-class two-day delivery, thereby doubling or tripling delivery times, would address the existing service problems that many of my constituents and Americans across the country have experienced. The Postmaster General‚Äôs proposed solution to problems he created is to surrender. You can watch our Committee exchange here.	Passing the Equality Act	Last week, the¬†House just voted 224 to 206 to pass the Equality Act to end discrimination against LGBTQ Americans in housing, education, public accommodations and employment. This is thrilling progress for civil rights in America. Every year I've been in Congress,¬†I've been a proud cosponsor of this bill and proudly voted YES.	Serving as Lead House Impeachment Manager	I recently served as Lead House Impeachment Manger in the U.S. Senate Impeachment Trial of former President Donald Trump. In the most bipartisan presidential impeachment vote in the history of the country, a powerful majority of both houses of Congress found that the former President incited violent insurrection against the Union and the Congress. I thank my constituents for engaging so passionately with this crucial process and for all of your messages.	Passing the American Recovery Act		Days ago, the House passed the American Rescue Plan to deliver stimulus checks to our people, revitalize our economy, and crush the deadly COVID-19 virus. Click here to see a breakdown of what's included in our House-passed bill. I urge the Senate to swiftly pass this legislation without further delay so we can provide urgently-needed relief to millions of struggling Americans.			This mailbox cannot receive replies.

3/2/21,Update on my efforts to protect green space in LA,"Dear Friend: 	I wanted to share an exciting legislative update with you on an open space expansion we‚Äôve been working on for almost 20 years: 	Last week,¬†the House passed my¬†Rim of the Valley Corridor Preservation Act, which will expand and protect 191,000 acres in the areas surrounding the Los Angeles Basin. I‚Äôve been working with constituents and community environmental advocates on this effort for nearly two decades. It will enable the National Park Service and our local community to better protect natural resources and habitats, providing us with improved access to nature for recreational and educational purposes. 	This legislation passed the House as part of a package of public lands bills called the¬†Protecting America‚Äôs Wilderness and Public Lands Act.¬†It‚Äôs now headed to the Senate, where it awaits a vote. 	¬†    WATCH: Rep. Schiff speaks on the House Floor in support of the Rim of the Valley Corridor Preservation Act 	¬† 	Those unfamiliar with Los Angeles may think it‚Äôs connected only by freeways. But we know that‚Äôs just not true. Los Angeles is connected by wildlife and open spaces that bridge our communities and bring us together. 	I¬†held a virtual press conference¬†with my Congressional colleagues from California, environmental organizations, and community advocates. One community leader, Ulmira Lopez, spoke about the first time she had the opportunity to visit the San Gabriel Mountains and highlighted the importance of protecting public lands:  ‚ÄúThat visit [to the] San Gabriel Mountains changed my view of living. It changed my mind about how I was taking care of myself. In that visit, I was able to experience freedom, peace, harmony, and a beautiful display of nature around me.‚Äù 	Protecting Los Angeles‚Äô beautiful wilderness is an environmental imperative. It‚Äôs a public health imperative. It‚Äôs a racial justice and economic equity imperative. 	And good news ‚Äì President Biden strongly supports this bill, which directly contributes to his goal to conserve more public lands and waters and protect our communities from the effects of climate change. 	Now, the Senate must pass this legislation so that we can preserve this breathtakingly beautiful land for generations to come. 	I‚Äôll continue to keep you updated on the progress of my Rim of the Valley Corridor Preservation Act. In the meantime, enjoy some socially-distanced time outside, wear a mask, and enjoy the magic of Los Angeles‚Äô open spaces! 	¬† 	Thank you,   	Congressman Adam Schiff",S001150

3/9/21,WATCH: Rep. Raskin's Medicare 101 Forum,"March 9, 2021	Dear Neighbor,	Did you know that some individuals get Medicare coverage automatically, and others have to¬†sign up for coverage? You may have to sign up if you‚Äôre 65, or¬†almost 65, and not currently getting Social Security. Many Americans don't realize that they may have to pay a penalty if they do not enroll in Medicare Part B coverage when they are first eligible.¬†¬†	I recently hosted a virtual¬†Medicare 101 Forum¬†with Diana Varela of the Social Security Administration (SSA) and¬†Sharon Graham of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to help guide constituents on their individual Medicare journeys.¬†	Our Forum provides essential information and answers common questions about Medicare, including:¬†		Who is eligible for Medicare?	How do I enroll in Medicare?	When can I enroll in Medicare?		Initial Enrollment Period: beginning 3 months before and ending 3 months after your 65th birthday	General Enrollment Period: January 1 to March 31, with coverage beginning in July	Special Enrollment Period: applies if you are 65 and over and covered in a group health plan based on your or your spouse‚Äôs current employment¬†¬†			How much will Medicare Coverage cost?	What help is available for people with limited income and resources?	What are the different parts of Medicare?		Part A ‚Äì Hospital Insurance¬†	Part B ‚Äì Medical Insurance¬†	Part D ‚Äì Prescription Drug Care¬†	Medigap (also known as Supplemental Insurance Coverage)¬†	Medicare Advantage (includes Part A, B, D and extra benefits)			What care does Medicare cover? What care is not covered by Part A and Part B?	What factors should I consider when deciding if I should enroll in Medicare?	What should I do if I disagree with a denial of coverage for care I received?		Because Social Security and Medicare services are often related, it can be confusing to determine which agency to contact for help. I encourage you to use this chart to¬†help you determine which agency to contact.¬†	I encourage all interested constituents to watch our virtual forum by clicking here or clicking the image below.¬†	If you have any questions, please call my District Office at 301-354-1000.								As always, I encourage people across the 8th District to continue to share their concerns and insights with me and my staff by¬†contacting my¬†office¬†or connecting with me on¬†Facebook,¬†Twitter, or¬†Instagram.¬†	All Best,				This mailbox cannot receive replies.

3/16/21,Reflecting on one year of the COVID crisis,"Dear Friend: 	It‚Äôs been a year since this virus first brought our society to a standstill, a year since many of us packed up our offices and started working from home, and a year since we‚Äôve been able to hug elderly parents or travel to visit family. Many of us have a distinct memory of a last pre-pandemic event before we realized that life was about to change. For me, it was attending my cousin‚Äôs wedding last February, the last of our big family gatherings. That was the last time I got to hang out with my father, who recently turned 93. 	To say the last year has been difficult would be a gross understatement. Precious few have escaped the devastation of COVID-19. More than 29 million Americans have confirmed infections and over 530,000 of our fellow citizens have died. They were our family, our friends, and our beloved community members. And numbers alone fail to convey the immeasurable sense of grief, anxiety and despair this year has wrought. 	COVID-19 also crippled our economy, and tens of millions of Americans lost their jobs, their livelihoods, and even their homes. Too many families have spent the past year worried about how to pay the bills, put food on the table, and keep a roof over their head. 	This year has changed us all. This year tested the height of our courage and the depth of our gratitude. We‚Äôve learned anew to appreciate the little things, from sunny walks in the park to a well-cooked meal shared, albeit virtually, with friends and family.¬† 	But I know that it‚Äôs been hard to hold on to hope, as the months went by with no resolution in sight, the death toll continuing to rise, more and more empty chairs at dinner tables nationwide. The previous Administration‚Äôs mismanagement of this crisis widened the chasm between us and the¬†distance to the¬†light at the end of the tunnel. Sometimes it seemed as though we may never again know normalcy.  But I‚Äôm here to tell you that we can start to feel hopeful again. I know I am. 	Last week, Congress passed and President Biden signed into law the American Rescue Plan, a COVID relief package bold enough to meet the scale of this crisis. Its impact will be felt for generations. 	The American Rescue Plan will keep millions in their homes and out of poverty, cut child poverty in half, allow us to safely reopen schools and small businesses, and accelerate vaccine distribution so that we can finally bring an end to this pandemic. It‚Äôs the most ambitious, progressive piece of legislation to be signed into law in generations. 	It's a big deal. And perhaps the biggest news of all: The vaccine effort continues to ramp up and the Biden Administration has recommended that states and cities open up vaccinations to any American adult who wants one by no later than¬†May 1.¬†If we continue to follow public health guidance and get our shots, there‚Äôs a brighter summer ahead for all of us. 	After a year marred by strife, I know that hope can feel a little foolish and maybe even a little dangerous. It‚Äôs difficult to take good news in stride without waiting for the other shoe to drop. But with the American Rescue Plan in effect, we can breathe a sigh of relief and start to think about life after this crisis. 	Help is on the way,¬†but that help alone won‚Äôt be enough to crush the virus. We‚Äôve got to hold up our end of the bargain, by continuing to wear masks and follow public health guidance. If we let our guard down too early, we risk jeopardizing the progress we‚Äôve made thus far and prolonging this nightmare ‚Äì something none of us want. For my part, I want to see my Dad, and hug him again. And I want you to be able to do the same with your loved ones. 	We‚Äôve arrived at a hopeful juncture that just months ago seemed impossible ‚Äì let‚Äôs stay the course, and get through this together. 	Stay safe and healthy,   	Congressman Adam Schiff",S001150

3/22/21,WEDNESDAY: Telephone Town Hall on COVID-19 Vaccines & Distribution Plans,"Dear Friend:  As we mark the one year anniversary of the COVID-19 crisis, I know the questions on almost everyone‚Äôs mind are: When can I get vaccinated? When can my loved ones get vaccinated? How soon after a vaccine can I visit with family? And where do I sign up?  That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm hosting a telephone town hall on Wednesday, March 24 at 7:00pm PT with representatives from local, state, and federal agencies responsible for distributing and administering these safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines.   We‚Äôll hear from Dr. Paul Simon, Chief Science Officer for the LA County Department of Health, Robert Pesapane, Director of FEMA‚Äôs Recovery Division and Federal Coordinating Officer for California COVID Disaster Declaration, and a representative from the Department of Health and Human Services to answer your questions about vaccine availability and eligibility. I‚Äôll also be answering your questions about the American Rescue Plan and how it can benefit you or your family, including direct relief checks and unemployment assistance.  To join the call, dial in to 855-408-1340 or stream it online at schiff.house.gov/live and facebook.com/RepAdamSchiff/live.¬†  I hope you'll join us for this important conversation.
