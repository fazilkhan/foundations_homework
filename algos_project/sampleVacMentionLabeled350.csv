12/18/20 17:09,Senator Murphy COVID-19 Weekly Update: December 18th,"Friend – 
Below please find the Murphy office update on COVID-19. 
As always, if you need assistance, please don’t hesitate to contact our Hartford or Washington, D.C. offices. 
Here’s what you need to know this week: 
	•	Senator Murphy took to Facebook live on Friday afternoon to provide an update on the state of negotiations on the COVID-19 relief package, and the priorities he is pushing to include for constituents in Connecticut.
	•	Frontline health care workers in Connecticut received the first doses of the COVID-19 vaccine this week. On Friday, the vaccine also began to be administered to some nursing home staff and residents. Connecticut will continue to follow the recommendations made in the vaccine distribution plan developed by the Governor’s COVID-19 Vaccine Advisory Group’s Science Subcommittee.
	•	Senator Murphy hosted a discussion on Facebook live with Dr. Saad Omer, Director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, to discuss the COVID-19 vaccine and answer frequently asked questions from constituents. Dr. Omer answered questions on vaccine safety and the FDA review process, the different vaccines being approved and when we can expect things to return to normal.
	•	Governor Lamont announced that Connecticut has extended its eviction moratorium through February 9, 2021.
	•	This week, Senator Murphy met virtually with California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, President-elect Joe Biden’s nominee to become Secretary of Health and Human Services. The two discussed the importance of a coordinated, science-driven approach to tackling COVID-19. As a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, Murphy spoke to Becerra about the need to protect and expand the Affordable Care Act, improve access to mental health services, and strengthen U.S. engagement as a leader on global health.
	•	PURA has extended the enrollment period for programs to prevent heat source shut-offs for both residential and non-residential customers through at least February 9, 2021. Further, the Winter Protection Program, which protects eligible households during the winter months, is also in effect from November 1, 2020 through May 1, 2021. If you are experiencing difficulty paying your utility bill, you can contact your utility company and ask if you are eligible to be “coded hardship” and enrolled in the Winter Protection Program. If you are ineligible for hardship status or a non-residential customer, ask to enroll in a COVID-19 Payment Plan. Additional information regarding these programs and other assistance can be found here.
	•	As we approach the Christmas holiday next week, please take a moment to review guidance on how to safely prepare for holiday gatherings. The best thing you can do to protect yourself, friends, and family during the holidays is to only celebrate in-person with members of your immediate household. The best way for us to keep cases down in the state is to stay home and away from others, and celebrate with those outside of our household virtually.

This week, I held 12 Q&As in northwest Iowa as part of my annual 99 county meetings. It was a privilege to tour local businesses, meet with high school students and take questions from local television and radio stations. 
I’m very glad that the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration has announced a $1.5 million grant to the city of Ames to provide critical water infrastructure for a new industrial park and a $1 million grant to the city of Sioux City to support growth in the aviation sector.
Thanks to the hard work of Governor Reynolds and the countless public health officials and health care workers, all Iowans who are sixteen and older are now eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine. Check out this resource for more information on how to schedule an appointment.

2/19/21 15:34,"PPP Webinar, Bloomfield Small Biz Walk, Washington Update","Dear Friends,  As we continue to recognize Black History Month, I went on a small business walk to visit with Black-owned businesses in Bloomfield. Below is a video of our walk and conversations with the owners of Salon Femi, Café Mobay, and Pure Love Pies.
In our ongoing efforts to support local small businesses, my team and I held a webinar this week focused on Paycheck Protection Program loans. Below you will find a recording of the presentation. You will also find an update on my new committee work. 
I continue to hear from constituents and our medical providers about the need for an increased supply of vaccines. I was happy to hear the Biden administration announce this week that they are doubling the number of vaccines distributed to retail pharmacies such as CVS, Walgreens, and Rite Aid, from one million a week to two million. They are also increasing the vaccine supply to states by 13.5 million doses. For more information on how to check your eligibility and how to make an appointment, head to my website, https://sherrill.house.gov/vaccine. 
I also wanted to share an update on my efforts to hold those who took part in the January 6 insurrection on our Capitol accountable. This week, Congresswoman Jackie Speier (D-CA), Congressman Tom Reed (R-NY), Congressman Andrew Garbarino (R-NY), and I introduced the Commission on Domestic Terrorism Act of 2021. This bill would create an independent, bipartisan commission and be modeled after the 9/11 Commission. You can read more about the legislation below.
Stay safe everyone and take care,

Mikie Sherrill

Black History Month Spotlight: Black-Owned Businesses

Click to Watch
I joined Mayor Venezia, Commissioner Pomares, and Councilman Joanow last week at Black-owned businesses in Bloomfield as part of our Black History Month celebration. Thanks to Salon Femi, Café Mobay, and Pure Love Pies for talking about your businesses and the impact of COVID. These check-ins with the community are important for my work — at my roundtable last summer with Black small business owners, we discussed the challenges businesses without relationships with large institutional lenders had in accessing the first round of PPP. In December we passed the Economic Aid Act that incorporated a phased reopening of the PPP program by lender type to address this issue.

Small Business Webinar
 
Click to Watch
The coronavirus relief package we passed in December included additional funding for small businesses. This week, my team hosted a webinar on the Paycheck Protection Program with Small Business Association New Jersey District Director Al Titone, the New Jersey’s Bankers Association Executive Vice President and Director of Government Relations Mike Affuso, and the Women’s Center for Entrepreneurship Executive Director Rana Shanawani. Click above to watch the presentation for useful information on federal PPP loans and small business relief.
If you need assistance applying for a PPP loan, please reach out to my office. 

Education and Labor Committee Update
I am happy to announce that I was named to the Higher Education and Workforce Investment Subcommittee on the House Education and Labor Committee. This subcommittee has jurisdiction over education and workforce development beyond the high school level, including the Higher Education Act, adult education, postsecondary career and technical education, apprenticeship programs, science and technology programs, domestic volunteer programs, and national service programs.
Programs that build and support a strong workforce pipeline, connect students with the jobs of today, and ensure Americans have the training they need to adapt to the jobs of tomorrow will help to jumpstart our employment recovery from this pandemic and provide long-term benefits. I am excited to work with my colleagues on the Higher Education and Workforce Investment subcommittee as we get past this pandemic and support getting Americans back to work and our economy back on track.
 

My keynote address to New Jersey community colleges.
  
Community colleges across New Jersey provide an important pathway to education for residents — from first-generation students to those seeking training for a new career. I joined members and students from 16 New Jersey community colleges last week as their keynote speaker. I look forward to working with New Jersey's community college network to help create a strong workforce pipeline for the jobs of today and tomorrow.


My meeting with leaders from independent colleges and universities in NJ.
  
I also met with leaders of independent colleges and universities in NJ-11 and New Jersey to discuss the impact of COVID on their institutions and their students and was excited to talk about serving on the Higher Education & Workforce Investment Subcommittee. Our independent colleges and universities in NJ-11 serve a large number of first-generation and Pell-eligible students, and I appreciate their commitment to supporting their students, especially during this unprecedented time.
  
Armed Services Committee Update  
Picatinny Arsenal is one of our military’s foremost centers of innovation, making key advancements in armaments and munitions. Last week, I was named the Vice Chair of the Tactical Air and Land Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over Picatinny Arsenal. I look forward to supporting Picatinny as it continues to lead the way in ensuring our service members have the best, most advanced equipment possible.

 January 6 Commission  
In January, I joined colleagues in calling for the creation of an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate the federal government’s failure to appropriately respond to and prevent domestic terrorism and violent extremism. On Thursday, I joined with Representatives Jackie Speier (D-CA), Tom Reed (R-NY), and Andrew Garbarino (R-NY) to introduce the Commission on Domestic Terrorism Act of 2021. 
This bill would create an independent, bipartisan commission and be modeled after the 9/11 Commission. By broadening the investigation beyond the January 6 attack, the commission will be able to conduct a more robust investigation and provide better-informed recommendations to ensure the government is fully equipped to counter and prevent acts of domestic terrorism. Congress must act swiftly to pass this legislation to establish this commission so we can determine exactly how we got to January 6 and how we move forward as a country. Read more here.  
I'm incredibly honored to serve the 11th District and will continue to work hard on the issues that will move New Jersey, and this country, forward.

4/2/21 14:43,A Plan to Boost Jobs and Rebuild our Economy,"Dear Neighbors,
President Biden announced a major infrastructure plan this week that will help rebuild our economy and combat climate change. The American Jobs Plan is exactly what our nation needs right now to revitalize our communities. There is no better way to rebuild our economy for the future than to modernize our badly aging infrastructure and that’s exactly what this plan does. The President’s bold proposal will also combat the climate crisis by reducing carbon pollution and moving us toward a clean energy future.
Superfund sites threaten public and environmental health in New Jersey and across the country, and those sites could be cleaned up faster with adequate funding. This plan would reinstate the “polluter pays” taxes so that the very industries most responsible for polluting our land and water are held responsible for cleaning them up. The American Jobs Plan also invests in clean and efficient energy, safe drinking water, expanded access to broadband, Brownfield cleanups, and improving our nation’s health care infrastructure. Read more here 
President Biden announced this week that his Administration will expand offshore wind energy off the Jersey Shore. This will help us combat the climate crisis and create tens of thousands of good-paying, union jobs.

SAFE & EFFECTIVE VACCINE DEPLOYMENT

I’m fully confident the vaccines approved by the FDA are safe and effective, and they are the key to our nation’s recovery. I will continue working with federal, state, and local officials to ensure vaccine doses are distributed in our communities as efficiently as possible so that together we can defeat this invisible enemy.
Indiana is implementing a phased plan to administer FDA-approved vaccines, starting with frontline health care workers, residents and staff of long-term care facilities, and now all Hoosiers aged 65 or older.
To register and to find the nearest vaccination clinic:  Call 2-1-1 or visit OurShot.in.gov.
The state has opened hundreds of vaccination sites with at least one in every country. So far 828,078 Hoosiers have received their first dose, and 347,508 have been fully vaccinated. Vaccines administered by the state are free to all Indiana residents, but insurance may be charged an administrative fee.
The second dose will be scheduled at the clinic when the first dose is administered. A caregiver or loved one also may make an appointment on behalf of an eligible senior.
VACCINES FOR VETERANS
Attention Hoosier veterans – the St. Joseph County VA Clinic will be providing free COVID-19 vaccinations to veterans by appointment only. Appointments can be made in-person at the clinic starting Tuesday, February 16th through Friday, February 19th.

Congressman McHenry Weekly Update 


Ensuring We Trust the Results of Our Nation's Elections



As last week’s Senate hearing and North Carolina’s own experiences illustrated, there were serious issues with this November’s election. Voter fraud is real but too often claims are ignored and left uninvestigated. In the runup to November’s election, countless states—including North Carolina—changed their election procedures by bureaucratic decree rather than a change in state laws.
These actions have the potential to disenfranchise voters and—even worse—leave Americans distrusting the results of our elections. This is dangerous and unsustainable. In January when the new Congress convenes, I plan to introduce legislation to address these issues. We must restore trust in our nation’s elections and ensure all Americans can trust the results. Click here or on the image below for a good rundown on last week's Senate hearing on election fraud.







North Carolina's Healthcare Workers Are Receiving the Coronavirus Vaccine



It is amazing to see that—thanks to Operation Warp Speed—healthcare workers on the front lines battling the pandemic here in North Carolina started receiving the coronavirus vaccine at the beginning of last week. We also received more good news at the end of the week when Moderna's coronavirus vaccine also received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). I am so thankful for the innovation and hard work of the scientists and manufacturers who were able to develop a safe and effective vaccine in record time.







Celebrating Three Years of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act



Three years ago we passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and fulfilled our promise to provide tax relief for families and small business like those I represent the in the Tenth District. After tax reform, average household incomes soared nearly eight percent in less than three years. Now, more than ever, as we continue to battle the impact the coronavirus pandemic has had on our communities, American families and businesses need pro-growth policies like tax reform.







What I Have Been Reading



Vigil in memory of Officer Tyler Herndon

Gaston Gazette 

I was moved to see the pictures from last weekend's vigil in honor of fallen Officer Tyler Herndon. Last Sunday would have been Tyler’s 26th birthday. I join the Gaston County community as they mourn the loss of a life cut short. Please join me in praying for Tyler’s family and loved ones, the Mount Holly Police Department, and all of our law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line every day. 


1903- the First Flight

National Park Service 

Last Thursday, we celebrated the 117th anniversary of the first flight, an incredible feat accomplished by Orville and Wilbur Wright right here in North Carolina. It is a great reminder of the power of American innovation at work.


62% of small-business owners fear pandemic's worst is yet to come

Fox Business 

A recent poll by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce found that 74% of small business owners nationwide need additional aid to weather the pandemic. This is crucial aid that Speaker Pelosi and the Democrats have been holding up for their own political gain. We must help our nation's small businesses now.

12/19/20 9:30,Taking Advantage of Technology in 2020,"Congressman Smith's E-news: December 19, 2020  


Congratulations to Andy Vu, a Kearney High student and winner of the Congressional App Challenge 
for the Third District. I met with Andy and his mother this week to congratulate him on his work and learn more about his app called “Quick Mental Math.” 

Taking Advantage of Technology in 2020

Over the past two weeks, I have met via video conference with winners of the Third District Excellence in Innovation and Adaptation Recognition (EIAR), as well as the Third District’s winner in this year’s Congressional App Challenge. While I prefer meeting with Nebraskans in person, being able to recognize Nebraskans who innovated in the face of a pandemic while using technology seemed entirely appropriate. 

I rarely used video conferencing to host meetings before the pandemic. However, after being invited to participate in an online forum with the Kearney Chamber of Commerce in April, I decided to start hosting my own virtual outreach to provide timely COVID relief information to individuals and businesses in the Third District. Video technology was useful for hospitals and healthcare workers to talk about the CARES Act’s provider relief funding, for banks and small businesses to ask questions about programs like the Payroll Protection Program, and for producers to learn about assistance from USDA.

This technology has allowed me to meet with Nebraskans throughout the district in the same way. In a typical year, I meet daily with constituents who are visiting Washington, D.C., whether they are in town with groups such as the Nebraska Farm Bureau or visiting as tourists. This year, I was able to connect with many of these groups via video, and discuss the important issues facing Nebraskans. One of my favorite parts of my job is meeting with students in the classroom. It was interesting to logon with student groups and see how they were utilizing online learning.

I have found video meetings could be helpful in connecting Nebraskans with federal officials who may not typically find the time to get out to rural areas like the Third District on a regular basis. This benefit was on display when we were able to speak with United States Trade Representative Ag Negotiator Gregg Doud and USDA Farm Service Agency Administrator Richard Fordyce as part my online Agriculture Summit this summer, and when Ted McKinney, the USDA Under Secretary for Trade joined my small business webinar series in November. We were able to discuss many crucial topics, and technology made it possible.

Although 2020 did not go the way many of us were expecting, Nebraskans always make the best of things. Positive developments like the rollout of multiple vaccines, which have been proven safe and effective through rigorous examination by the Food and Drug Administration, have me looking forward to seeing more Nebraskans in person again in 2021. However, I hope to continue taking advantage of online meeting technology, in addition to resuming in person meetings, to be even more accessible to Nebraskans in the future. I will also continue working to ensure better, faster access to broadband across rural Nebraska to ensure even more Nebraskans are able to connect in this way in the future. As we head into the new year, let’s take the lessons learned of the past year, and move forward together.

Senior Service Fair
 
In light of the COVID-19 pandemic I will not be hosting the Senior Service Fair this year. Last year this event was held alongside Medicare Open Enrollment. Though our in-person meetings are limited, my office is ready to help with issues regarding Medicare and Social Security or any other federal agency.

NEWS FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT
Dear Friend, 
Memorial Day is tomorrow. This holiday is typically seen as the official start of summer; however, it’s also a day of remembrance for the brave men and women who gave all to protect our country. As many of you know, I served in the U.S. Army. I’ve had the privilege of working with some of the best soldiers to ever serve in the U.S. Armed Forces. There’s a strong bond amongst those who have served, and to lose one of our own is like losing a family member. But why we all make the sacrifice – because we love this country.   I had the honor of joining fellow veterans in posting flags and honoring our fallen at Tallahassee National Cemetery. It could not have been a more perfect day as we shared old stories about our days in the service and remembered the courageous people we’ve met over the years.    Tomorrow, please take a moment to pause and remember those who gave everything for our great nation. They are the reason we enjoy the freedoms we have today.   

  
Please read about my week below:

Kaitlyn’s artwork, titled “The Calm After The Storm,” is a watercolor portrait depicting a half-sunken sailboat off the coast of Panama City, left behind after the devastation of Hurricane Michael.   I would also like to congratulate Anna Barber of Marianna High School, who was awarded second place for her painting titled “Stunning. Refreshing…Essential.” Tied for 3rd place was Jake Wooley of Suwannee High School with his sketch titled “Quiet Reverie” and Elizabeth Baggett of Marianna High School with her piece titled “The Joseph W. Russ House.”  We had an exceptional selection of entries from young artists throughout our district this year. As many know, Hurricane Michael caused a great deal of devastation throughout our district. Kaitlyn’s painting not only reflects the destruction but also gives a sense of hope. This piece is a reminder to all of us that we can overcome whatever disaster comes our way, and that’s the perfect message following this pandemic. I look forward to seeing Kaitlyn’s artwork hanging in the Capitol for visitors from across the country to see.   Thank you to all our participants for your inspiring contributions, and to our judges for helping us choose the winners! View the works of art from our runners-up here.   
Visiting UF/IFAS in Suwannee County 

On Wednesday, I had the privilege of touring UF/IFAS North Florida Research and Education Center - Suwannee Valley. UF/IFAS has an impressive operation and continuously churns out great work. The importance of agricultural research funding cannot be overstated. Our producers play a pivotal role in our nation, and they must be given the tools necessary to produce their best crops and meet market demands.  Thank you, Florida Farm Bureau Federation and UF/IFAS, for hosting me! I look forward to working closely with both groups to advance the interests of Florida’s farmers, ranchers, and foresters.   
Stopping by James Madison Institute 

On Thursday, I stopped by James Madison Institute (JMI) in Tallahassee for a luncheon to give an update on what’s going on in Congress and my policy priorities for the 117th Congress. I spoke about getting the government out of the way of innovation and the importance of public-private partnerships. JMI is a great group of passionate conservatives and I’m grateful for the opportunity to speak with them. Thank you all for hosting me!    Update from the Internal Revenue Service   The latest information on the processing of 2020 tax returns is available on IRS.gov at IRS Operations During COVID-19.

What’s Happening on Capitol Hill  Protecting Consumers Like You  
This past week, the House Energy & Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce met to discuss the Consumer Protection and Recovery Act (H.R. 2688). While this bill seeks to help victims of various monetary scams, I have serious concerns with giving the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) unbound authority.   I am hesitant to support any new rulemaking process that could eliminate the input from the Commission’s agencies, Bureaus, offices, and Commissioners, all of who have industry-specific knowledge of the FTC’s vast portfolio. More importantly, I’m hesitant to give the government more authority.   I offered an amendment to require the FTC Chair to rescind the recently established centralized rulemaking group--an effort that would sidestep many checks and balances within the Commission, like an economic analysis. The centralized rule making group will make it far easier for the Biden Administration to impose their radical agenda on our nation’s businesses. Unfortunately, Democrats blocked my amendment.  
Coronavirus Updates  Latest Update 
On Wednesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the investigational monoclonal antibody therapy sotrovimab for the treatment of mild-to-moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients (12 years of age and older weighing at least 40 kilograms [about 88 pounds]) with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing and who are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death. This means that you now have more treatment options for COVID-19, which is excellent news. Read more about the EUA here.  Get Vaccinated 
Floridians 12 and up are now eligible to receive any COVID-19 vaccine as prescribed by the Food and Drug Administration. The Pfizer vaccine is authorized for persons age 12 and up. The Moderna vaccine is authorized for persons age 18 and up.  I encourage you to pre-register for the COVID-19 vaccine. The State of Florida has partnered with Sharecare to provide an easy-to-use platform that will save your spot for your shot. Pre-register here. Florida has many sites providing the COVID-19 vaccine. Use the vaccine finder to find a site near you. Supplies are limited and appointments may be required.

Dear Friend:  
Our nation is reckoning with a deadly pandemic that only continues to worsen. The United States has crossed 15,200,000 infections and 286,000 deaths due to COVID-19. Yesterday, we recorded over 2,600 deaths and yet another single-day record of 104,600 coronavirus hospitalizations.  
During this deeply trying time, I want to ensure you have the latest information about the pandemic and my work in Congress to protect the safety and economic security of North Jersey workers and families.
Update on Cases in New Jersey 
As of December 9, there are 378,891 confirmed cases and 17,426 deaths in our state, an increase of 35,152 infections and 343 deaths from last week.  
Yesterday, New Jersey reported 5,820 new coronavirus cases and an additional 90 confirmed deaths. The state’s hospitals yesterday reported 3,481 patients, the highest number in nearly seven months, as new admissions continue to outpace those being discharged.
Containing the Spread 
This week, Governor Murphy stated that New Jersey hospitals are preparing to receive the first shipments of COVID-19 vaccines next week. The Governor expects the state to receive 76,000 doses of the vaccine next week — the first of three shipments this month. By the end of the month, hospitals could receive between 300,000 and 500,000 total doses, which will be reserved for inoculating people in high priority groups, like health care workers. 
In preparation for the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines to New Jersey, Governor Phil Murphy signed an Executive Order which automatically enrolls residents who choose to receive a COVID-19 vaccine into the state’s existing vaccine registry. This will allow the state to ensure vaccines are safely and efficiently distributed. Residents who receive a vaccine will be able to opt-out of the registry after the public health emergency expires.  
In light of the rapidly increased coronavirus spread, Governor Murphy has announced several COVID-19 mitigation measures. The indoor gathering limit is currently 10 people and the outdoor gathering limit is currently 25 people, with certain exceptions detailed here. There is no limit on outdoor gatherings for wedding ceremonies, funerals, memorial services, religious activities, or political activities.  
Additionally, restaurants, bars, and lounges must close their indoor premises from 10:00pm-5:00am and will not be allowed to offer indoor bar seating at any time. Further, anyone returning or visiting from out of state beyond the immediate region (New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, and Delaware) must abide by the state travel advisory to self-quarantine for 10 days, or 7 days with a negative test.  
You can help contact tracing efforts by downloading the new COVID Alert NJ app. This app notifies users if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. 
State and Federal Aid 
Since the start of the pandemic, the federal government has provided New Jersey with $18.31 billion in support, including over $13 billion in unemployment assistance and over $2 billion in state coronavirus relief funding. The bulk of this funding was authorized by the Coronavirus, Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which I was proud to vote in favor of in March. 
In May, and once again in October, the House of Representatives passed the HEROES Act to provide additional relief to families, frontline workers, first responders, and states and cities. The Senate has not yet considered it. As negotiations on further COVID-19 relief continue, I will be sure to keep you updated. 
Unemployment 
Since the start of the pandemic, the New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development (NJDOL) has dispersed more than $13 billion in federal unemployment benefits and $5.8 billion in state unemployment benefits. More than 1.8 million New Jersey workers have filed for unemployment since March. Claimants have received an average of $13,787 in benefits. 
Additionally, we are fast approaching December 26, when federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) and Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) will expire without congressional action. PEUC provides an additional 13 weeks of unemployment payments for those who have exhausted their 20 weeks of state unemployment payments. PUA provides unemployment benefits to those who were employed as independent contractors. Approximately 312,000 residents are currently receiving PUA; an additional 175,000 are receiving PEUC.  
The House of Representatives has passed the HEROES Act, which provides an additional $600 weekly federal benefit for those collecting unemployment and extends PUA and PEUC unemployment benefits. The Senate has not yet considered it. As negotiations on additional federal unemployment relief continue, I will be sure to keep you updated. 
If you are experiencing issues receiving your owed unemployment benefits, please reach out to my Paterson office at 973-523-5152 for assistance.  

We are facing a global pandemic, and ensuring the safety of all families from COVID-19 and its impact on day-to-day life is my top priority. My office has prepared an informational webpage to ensure workers, families, businesses, and health care providers know their options for relief. For the latest on the coronavirus in New Jersey, check the state’s website at covid19.nj.gov.  
You can always reach me and my staff in Washington at 202-225-5751 or New Jersey at 973-523-5152 for assistance or further guidance. Remember, my door is always open to you. We are all in this together.

December 8, 2020 
@MyKitchenTable: Tuesday, December 8, 2020
Dear Friend: 
Those of you that know me a little bit know my spirit for the Michigan Wolverines, and I’ve been often quoted that when they lose, I sleep in the basement at everyone in my family’s bequest.  Even John Kerry, when we both served on the “Super Committee” told me that he began to root for Michigan as I was in a much better mood on Monday, if they won.  Last week, my quote was one that ""I would rather try and lose than lose without trying."" Though I certainly regret the reason why, I am overjoyed that Michigan will not lose at Columbus this Saturday - especially as a 30-point underdog, and my socks will not be thrown at the TV.  Let’s hope they all recover from this dreadful COVID pandemic. 

On the House floor yesterday (removed my mask only for speaking)  
We are in the throes of the lame duck session with lots of issues coming to a head. The ‘21 Fiscal Year began Oct. 1 and a Continuing Resolution (CR) was signed by the president preventing a shutdown and extending funding through Dec. 11. The Appropriations Committee has failed to produce an extension for the balance of the Fiscal Year and to prevent a shutdown, we will likely pass a 7-day extension on Wednesday which will require a 2/3 vote for passage (thus no amendments can be offered and will not require a simple majority for passage). Funding continues therefore without increases or decreases at FY ‘20 levels. Hopefully an agreement can be passed completing the funding for FY ‘21 next week.  Likely coupled with that will be elements of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus (PSC) $908B initiative that we unveiled last week.  Aid for small businesses (PPP), broadband, health care providers, unemployment funding, educators, state/local funding (no money to bail out pension funds or past deficits...only itemized losses of tax revenue—sales and gas taxes—would qualify), and liability protections, are the main sections of our proposal, and we expect to release those individual sections within the next 24 hours or so.  Our main “sticking” point is trying to write the liability provisions and have failed so far to come together with the proper language.     Mitch McConnell announced last Spring that liability protections would need to be a part of the proposal to advance through the Senate.  Without language there, it could well be that the funds to help our municipalities revenue losses would also drop out and therefore provide a force to ensure that both topics would gain traction in a Biden Administration to be addressed in February or March.     I spoke on a conference call as a guest on the PPP Forgiveness Coalition with more than 150 industry stakeholder organizations for an update which included the US chamber, American Farm Bureau, Independent Community Bankers, Home Builders, Realtors, and NFIB.  I let them know that I would be posting the sections on this website of the COVID package when available.    One major element that the PSC had in our September COVID proposal that is not in the present one are individual stimulus checks. Bernie Sanders conceded yesterday that the democrats held up the COVID package in September as the Republicans would get credit prior to the election for the individual checks.  CNN host Jake Tapper asked Sanders whether it was a mistake for Democrats to walk away from the White House’s $1.8T, which included the individual payments when Speaker Pelosi was proposing a $2.2T.     The “bar” was then lowered to <$1T and the individual stimulus checks do not fit within that window.   Included in the PPP provisions are the tax-free consequences for small businesses that took advantage of the program last spring. I have heard from a good number of small businesses who have barely held on that wonder if they still can if they are then liable for perhaps a 30% tax on those loans/grants.  CNN reported that as many as 10,000 restaurants are expected to close in the next 3 week with 17% (110,000) already permanently closed in ‘20. It is paramount that the signal is sent ASAP to all the PPP recipients as we close out 2020 that there will be no tax consequence. You can see that CNN story HERE.  HHS has released a number of important dates this next week (ie: FDA Vaccine Advisory Board will meet 12/10 to discuss the Emergency Use Authorization—EUA—for Pfizer’s vaccine) which you can see HERE.   Today I announced that the FCC spectrum auction expanded broadband to some 16,280 southwest Michigan rural homes and businesses allocating some $13M to help close the digital divide.  FCC Chair Pai said, “We structured this innovative and groundbreaking auction to prioritize bids for high-speed, low-latency service to deliver the best results for rural Americans....and the Commissions single largest step ever taken toward delivering digital opportunity to every American...” You can read more HERE.  We are nearly 4 years to the day of President Obama signing 21st Century Cures into law.  I was then Chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee where Diana DeGette (D-CO) and I led the legislative path for this bipartisan legislation to be enacted.  She and I zoomed today with the Milken Institute Health Summit on an update of the 21st Century Cures legislation that we hope to pass in the next Congress which we call “Cures, 2.0.” It was moderated by Politico, and we referenced that we truly expedited the approvals of drugs and devices keeping the important FDA safeguards and looking back, can probably claim that we shaved many months off what would have been the approval process for a COVID vaccine.  You can see that 30-minute zoom call HERE.  Lastly, last night I led a 30-minute Special Order on the House Floor (photo at the top) honoring my successor, Greg Walden (R-OR) as Chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, who is retiring with this Congress.  Democrats and Republicans praised his bipartisan leadership on a host of issues impacting Americans with opioid, telecommunication, community health centers, and Children’s Health among other pieces of important legislation. You can see that C-SPAN 30 minute broadcast HERE.  All the best, 
   Fred Upton

Dear Friend,
 
The last two weeks have been tremendously difficult and devastating for the Boulder community, as we mourn the 10 precious lives lost in the tragedy at the King Soopers. In the last week the Boulder community and 2nd District has shown incredible resiliency. We have witnessed an outpouring of love, prayers and support from community members in Boulder County and throughout our state and our country. 
 
In the words of Maya Angelou: “Love heals. Heals and liberates.” And so one of the most important things we can do right now, in this time of sadness and sorrow, and in the wake of tragedy, is to love each other, be kind to each other, and to take care of one another. 
 
We've already proven our ability to do so, through small acts of kindness, friendly hands extended from neighbor to neighbor and hundreds of individuals showing up for vigils to honor the lives lost and lift up their memories. For these reasons and more, we are Boulder Strong, and we will get through this moment together. 
  

 
The Boulder Strong Resource Center has been opened at 603 S Broadway Street for all community members to provide counseling, therapy dogs and support for victims. Also see our Community Resource Guide for other available resources for our community. 
 
WHAT ELSE SHOULD YOU KNOW?
	•	Governor Polis has announced that all Coloradans ages 16+ are now eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine! For more information on the COVID-19 vaccine in Colorado, visit the State of Colorado’s COVID-19 Vaccine page.  
	•	I recently introduced bipartisan legislation to support Colorado's mountain communities through funds for rural schools, road maintenance and emergency search and rescue operations. Learn more about how it will support Grand County here.   
	•	Our proposal to create a reimagined 21st Century Conservation Corps was included in President Biden's American Jobs Plan, which was recently released! After writing a letter to the President asking him to include the measure, we are excited to see the multi-billion dollar fund included to equip the next generation of conservation and resilience workers. Read more about the plan here.   
	•	We kicked off our Restoring Our Lands and Communities public lands listening tour by hearing from Coloradans along the Front Range. This week, we'll be chatting with folks on the Western Slope. RSVP here.   
	•	The American Rescue Plan will provide $6 billion in direct funds to Colorado through local stabilization funding for our cities and counties. Through the plan, Colorado will also receive funds for our school districts, food banks, vaccine implementation, stimulus checks and more. Read my piece with Senator Hickenlooper in the Denver Post to hear more about what Colorado will receive from the plan. 
I am wishing you and your family a safe a hopeful week. Please reach out to my office if there is any help you may need. 
 
Sincerely,

December 4, 2020
 
Friend,
 
I want to provide an update on my work throughout November.
 
The month's highlights included joining Stephanie Hamill on the One America News Network to discuss Governor Beshear's out-of-control indoor dining ban. We also discussed that it is in everyone's interest to determine the truth of the Presidential election results.
 
Closer to home, I joined with the Kentucky Congressional delegation to announce that 8 new C-130J Hercules aircraft are being deployed to the 123rd Airlift Wing of the Kentucky Air National Guard. I also hosted Interview Day for U.S. Service Academy applicants from Kentucky's 4th Congressional District. 
 
In addition, in November, President Trump took further steps to wind down the endless wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. I strongly support him in this effort. Speaking of President Trump, in Pennsylvania a whistleblower came forward who vindicated my efforts to make backdating postmarks on mail-in ballots illegal. I offered an amendment in the Oversight and Reform committee to criminalize fraudulent postmarks on September 16th, but every Democrat rejected it. 
 
For more details about these topics, please continue reading.
 
You can also keep track of my Congressional work on my regularly updated social media accounts. If you aren't following me on Facebook and Twitter already, I invite you to do so. 
 
 
 

 
 
Massie Discusses Beshear's Indoor Dining Ban on One America News Network
 
In case you missed it, I was a guest on OAN's ""In Focus with Stephanie Hamill."" We discussed that it is in everyone's interest to determine the truth of the Presidential election results. We also discussed Governor Beshear's out-of-control indoor dining ban (which will put many restaurants out of business), COVID-19 vaccine developments, and the support President Trump deserves for bringing troops home from Afghanistan.
 
I invite you to watch the segment by clicking on the image above. As I told Stephanie, the reason our Governor picked on restaurant owners is that they have to have a license to operate. Even though he doesn't have the Constitutional authority to shut down restaurants, he is able to take away their licenses.
 
 

 
Kentucky Congressional Delegation Announces Kentucky Air National Guard's 123rd Airlift Wing to Receive Eight New Aircraft
 
Kentucky's Congressional delegation has announced that Louisville's 123rd Airlift Wing of the Kentucky Air National Guard is one of only four Air Guard units in the entire United States chosen to receive eight new C-130J Super Hercules aircraft in 2021. These new aircraft will replace the eight C-130H aircraft the wing has been flying since 1992. According to Col. David J. Mounkes, wing commander of the 123rd Airlift Wing and with whom I previously met at the Kentucky Air National Guard Headquarters, these new aircraft “will reduce manpower requirements, lower operating and support costs, and provide life-cycle cost savings over earlier C-130 models.” It was a pleasure to work with my colleagues to encourage the Air Force to make this decision.
 
Approximately 7,500 citizen-soldiers and airmen serve in the Kentucky National Guard and are ready at a moment's notice to respond to crises at home and abroad.
Citizen soldiers in the Kentucky National Guard respond to the nation's defense needs and make the same personal sacrifices as their active-duty counterparts. It is vitally important that they receive the equipment needed to safely and effectively accomplish the objectives they are assigned in combat or peace-time missions. In Congress, I’m a member of the National Guard and Reserve Caucus and will continue to advocate for necessary upgrades and resources for the Kentucky National Guard.
 
From the delegation's press release, ""Kentucky Air National Guard Selected for Eight New Aircraft"":
 
""Congressman Massie said, 'Louisville's 123rd Airlift Wing is one of the most respected units in the nation. The Air Force's decision to deploy a new C-130J squadron to them means the men and women of the 123rd Airlift Wing will have the state-of-the-art equipment needed to fulfill their vital mission. I thank Secretary Barrett for recognizing the significant role Kentucky plays in defending our nation by selecting the 123rd Airlift Wing as one of only four recipients of these new aircraft.'""
 
Previously, I toured the Kentucky Air National Guard 123rd Airlift Wing and examined the C-130H models. The new C-130Js will greatly improve the 123rd’s response capabilities. This announcement is welcome news for Kentucky and our nation's defense.
 
 

  
Congressman Massie congratulates academy appointment recipient 
David ""Trey"" Gronotte during Interview Day.
 
Massie Hosts ""Interview Day"" for Military Academy Applicants
 
My staff and I hosted Interview Day for U.S. Service Academy applicants from Kentucky’s 4th Congressional District. Each year, Members of Congress have the privilege of recommending exceptional young men and women for admission to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, the Naval Academy, the Air Force Academy, and the Merchant Marine Academy, known collectively as the U.S. Service Academies.
 
The U.S. Service Academies offer a unique opportunity for motivated young adults to serve their country while improving all facets of their character through a rigorous scholastic curriculum and a disciplined moral and physical regimen. In place of tuition, the Academies require military service after graduation. Cadets and Midshipmen graduate as Officers in the United States Military, and many have gone on to be great leaders in our nation’s history.
 
An interview panel of academy graduates, officers, and academy liaisons from all branches of the military evaluated applicants and will make recommendations on who will receive a nomination from my office. I met with the panel to answer questions, to give an update on what’s happening in Washington, D.C., and to thank them for dedicating their Saturday to this. Before the panel spent the day interviewing candidates, we spoke candidly about the need to restore fiscal responsibility in Washington, the makeup of the incoming Congress, and my March 27th effort to force Congress to follow the Constitution with a roll call vote on the CARES Act.
 
The panel interviewed each of the applicants throughout the day. I wish each of the applicants the best and know the panelists will use their expertise to pick the most qualified and dedicated individuals. I want to express my sincere gratitude to all of the panelists and applicants for being willing to serve our country.
 
 
Massie Stands Solidly With President Trump's Decision to Reduce Troop Levels in Afghanistan
 
In July, I joined Congressman Andy Biggs on a letter asking President Trump to ""immediately withdraw"" all troops from Afghanistan and Iraq. The United States should not fight endless wars.
 
President Trump is taking steps to wind these wars down and bring our troops back home. As we said in our letter to him, ""the American people have paid dearly in both blood and treasure for past mistakes. We will stand solidly in your corner when you decide to bring our forces home.""

Massie's Election Integrity Amendment Validated by Whistleblower
 
A whistleblower has come forward with allegations that postmarks on ballots are being backdated at the post office. This time the allegations come from Pennsylvania.
 
Not only did I predict this would happen, but on September 16th I offered legislation to prevent it, and forced a vote on that legislation (video above). The Democrats said they were passing the underlying bill to ensure election integrity at the Post Office, so I offered an amendment to that legislation.
 
When I forced a vote on this, every Republican voted for it, and every Democrat voted against it. I told them during the debate that I thought it would be important to have this resolved before the election in order to help keep confidence in our elections. They said this wasn’t a problem. What do you think?
 
I support going back to a system of voting that delivers results ON ELECTION DAY.
 
Thank you for taking the time to read this newsletter.
 
In Liberty,


  
Thomas Massie
Member of Congress

Randy's Wrap Up 
 

 
In the District
 
  
Veterans Affairs  
  
 

 
  
Over the last few years, Southeast Texas has been hit with some trying times, to say the least. As we were still recovering from Hurricane Harvey and Tropical Storm Imelda, we got hit with COVID and Hurricane Laura. And just when Texas was getting back into the swing of things, we get a once-in-a-lifetime winter storm.  Through all of that, our Veterans Affairs officials and facilities did everything in their power to make sure our great veterans were still receiving the service they deserve.
 
When the Beaumont VA facility—which services about 10,000 veterans a year—took on about 9 inches of water, their building had some significant damage. They got a trailer from Mississippi, tents from Arkansas, and mobile medical units from Houston and set up a mobile clinic right in the parking lot.
 
And during the early months of the COVID vaccine rollout, the Houston VA was getting their patients vaccinated at record speeds. As early as the beginning of March, they were offering the vaccine to any veteran enrolled with the VA health care system—regardless of their age—not only at the main campus but also at satellite locations such as our Texas City VA Outpatient Clinic.
 
Now, nationwide, they administer COVID-19 vaccine walk-in appointments for Veterans, spouses, and caregivers. Not only did the Veterans Health Administration celebrate its 75th milestone anniversary during National Volunteer Week, this past April 18–24, the VA Voluntary Service marked 1 billion hours that volunteers have given of their time in service to Veterans at VA facilities.
 
They are not stopping there.  In the last few months alone, Congress and the VA are working together to make sure those who have selflessly served our country get the service they deserve.
 
In March, the Department of Veterans Affairs started implementing steps to improve its posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) claims processing. 
 
In April, they made it easier for patients and their families to access information about VA benefits and services by creating a single site—VA.gov—which is now the central portal for accessing VA benefits.
 
In May, as part of Mental Health Month, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs launched 1 Step Today to provide mental health guidance, resources, and sources of support, as well as community treatment options, for veterans on their mental health journey. “1 Step Today” was developed by Veterans to inspire their fellow Vets to start on a path toward recovery, well-being, and a healthier tomorrow—one step at a time.
 
This Memorial Day, the VA’s national cemeteries have announced they will allow mass flag placements across the U.S. to commemorate Memorial Day—just like before the pandemic! All 155 VA national cemeteries will be open Memorial Day weekend from dawn to dusk. The VA will also continue its partnership with Carry The Load this “Memorial May” to honor the sacrifices made by the military, Veterans, first responders, and their families. These are just a few examples of how the VA is honoring the commitment to our veterans!
 
Ahead of Memorial Day, I hosted a telephone town hall to give TX-14 veterans the opportunity to communicate directly with VA officials. Participating on the call was, Frank Vazquez, Medical Center Director; Ms. Sonja White, Nurse Manager of Care in the Community; Mr. Edward Perry, Veteran Service Representative, who answered questions about disability claims; Ms. Patricia Cruz, Assistant Loan Production Officer, who spoke about  VA home loan guaranty related issues; and Ms. Barbara Brookins, Employment Coordinator, who gave an update on Veteran Readiness & Employment related issues.
 
We thank our Veterans Affairs representatives for taking the time to speak directly with TX-14!  My mission is not only to represent your interests in Congress but to provide you with resources to help your every day life.  to all those that asked questions or simply listened in, thank you for your participation!

Art Competition Reception
 
  


This past Monday, we held a reception for our 2021 Congressional Art Competition winners. It was wonderful to meet and talk with our talented artists, their families, and teachers.
 
These students are brightening the world with their work and are an inspiration to us all. Congratulations and thank you for participating!
 
I also want to thank the teachers! We have the best teachers here in TX-14 and that was showcased last night through your students. We appreciate all you do!
 
Last but certainly not least, thank you Janet Brown. Janet has been organizing the TX-14 Art Competition since 2013. We are grateful for your hard work and dedication to our students!

This Week's Poll Question 
 
In April 2020, President Trump ordered intelligence agencies to investigate China and the World Health Organization after then  Secretary of State Pompeo said China violated WHO's international health regulations by failing to notify the U.N. agency within 24 hours of a possible public health emergency of international concern after cases of a new viral pneumonia appeared in late 2019. He also accused Beijing of failing to provide timely updates on the outbreak to WHO — another violation. 
 
Earlier this year, President Biden terminated the inquiry into the Wuhan lab and the origins of COVID-19.  After The Wall Street Journal reported three employees at the Wuhan Institute of Virology were hospitalized for symptoms consistent with both COVID-19 and common seasonal illness in November 2019 — just before the first reported COVID-19 cases — President Biden reversed course and ordered a new 90-day investigation. 
 
However, House Democrats still have not held a single hearing on the origins of the virus. Think about that. House Republicans have been asking for congressional investigatory resources to be devoted to this critical question for months. There is mounting evidence the pandemic started in a Chinese lab, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) covered it up. If that is the case, the CCP is responsible for the deaths of nearly 600,000 Americans and millions worldwide.
 
This week I joined my colleagues in sending a letter to Speaker Pelosi requesting her to join our quest for the truth and call on congressional committees to investigate the origins of COVID-19.

ABOUT DIANA
NEWS

Dear Friend, 
On Monday, the Supreme Court announced it will take up a case involving a Mississippi law that bans abortions after just 15 weeks. The Court’s decision to hear this case is a significant threat to Americans’ right to reproductive care and, depending on the outcome, could soon eliminate many of the rights and protections we are currently guaranteed under Roe v. Wade.  As co-chair of the Congressional Pro-Choice Caucus, one of my top focuses in Congress has been protecting our access to safe abortion care. I believe deeply that every single woman in this world – regardless of where she lives or how much money she makes – should have access to the health care she needs. And that’s why I am working, right now, with a group of my colleagues from both chambers of Congress to pass legislation known as the Women’s Health Protection Act, which would permanently codify the protections that are provided under Roe – making them the law of the land; and taking this issue out of the courts’ hands once and for all. 

 As we work to stave off this latest threat to our reproductive rights, we’re also working to minimize the threat of any future attacks on our Democracy – such as the one we saw on January 6th. The violence that unfolded that day – as a mob of insurrectionists stormed the U.S. Capitol building – marks one of the darkest days in our nation’s history. And it’s imperative that we understand the full truth of what happened.  This week, the House voted to create a nonpartisan, independent commission to investigate the January 6th attack. We simply want to know what happened, how it happened and what needs to be done to ensure it never happens again.  As one of the nine Impeachment managers who sought a conviction against Donald Trump for his actions that day, our goal in presenting our case was not to punish him, but to shed light on what happened in hopes of preventing such violence from ever happening again.  Our goal in establishing this independent commission is the same. Sadly, instead of working with us to help safeguard our country from such attacks in the future, 175 of my Republican colleagues voted against this bill. And, frankly, the American people should be outraged at anyone trying to cover up the truth.  

 As the chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee’s Oversight and Investigations panel, I have the unique responsibility of overseeing our nation’s top health agencies as they work to stop the spread of the coronavirus.  One of the challenges these agencies are facing now, as we try to vaccinate as many Americans as possible, is vaccine hesitancy. In fact, according to at least one recent study, 21 percent of rural Americans say they are definitely not getting the vaccine. And a new CDC report released this week found that vaccine hesitancy is now a “major barrier” to inoculating more Americans living in rural parts of the country.  The only way we are going to end this pandemic – and fully return to normal life – is by vaccinating a significant portion of our population. Next week, our oversight panel will hold an important hearing to hear from some of our nation’s top public health experts about what we can do to boost Americans’ confidence in these vaccines and combat any misinformation that may be out there about their safety.  If you’re interested, you can watch this hearing live, online, as soon as it begins on Wednesday, May 26, at 9:00 a.m. MT/11:00 a.m ET here.
As always, if you have any questions, or need anything at all, please don’t hesitate to contact my office at 303-844-4988, or visit my website at DeGette.House.Gov where you can learn more about all of the different ways that my staff is available to assist you.  Sincerely,

12/4/20 13:13,Bonamici Bulletin,"The pandemic hasn’t ended, and neither should federal relief for the many Oregonians who are struggling through no fault of their own. At the beginning of this pandemic, Congress passed legislation to provide a lifeline to families, workers, and small businesses. We must do it again. I will do everything I can to bring relief to NW Oregon. The House has passed two major bills, negotiations continue, and I’m hopeful that the Senate will soon join us in passing the aid that our communities so desperately need.  A smooth transition of power is important, especially in the midst of a pandemic. I’m encouraged that the Biden-Harris team is now able to begin the official transition and start receiving important security and economic briefings. I look forward to working with the new administration on the issues that matter most to our communities.  You’re invited! I’m going to be discussing the pandemic and other issues of concern and answering your questions during my telephone town hall meeting on Saturday, Dec. 5 at 11 a.m. There is still time to sign up to receive a call, or listen to a livestream, here. 
Feeding Our Neighbors

No one should be hungry in the United States, especially during the holidays. Yet far too many of our neighbors are facing hunger, and food banks across our region are seeing increased demand for services. The day before Thanksgiving, I convened advocates in our community and called for the Senate to finally pass our comprehensive relief bill to help those affected by hunger.  Portland Community College student Emily told me about dropping out of school because of housing and food insecurity, and being ""one flat tire"" away from hunger. Another student, Antonia, spoke about helping to put food on the table for her siblings while attending classes full time. An Oregon Food Bank volunteer shared that an older gentleman standing in line at a food pantry was in tears, saying ""please don't think I do this every day."" Their stories are compelling and too common, and I will continue fighting to support them.   

Keeping Our Community Safe

COVID-19 is spreading rapidly in Oregon and hospitalizations are increasing. Until a vaccine is widely distributed, the only way to contain the virus is for all of us to closely follow every public health guideline. 
Like many, my family adapted our Thanksgiving plans this year to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 and stay healthy. We miss in-person visits with family and friends, but these precautions are important. For the safety of your family and your neighbors during this holiday season, please continue to wear masks outside the home, maintain distance, limit indoor gatherings, and stay home as much as possible – especially if you are sick. Find the latest guidance from the Oregon Health Authority here.  Public health officials are the unsung heroes of this pandemic. Their leadership is critical, in part because the Trump administration failed to create a national plan to stop the virus. I’m working to make sure we give local health authorities the resources and respect they need to do their jobs safely. 

In Case You Missed It
  
	•	Congratulations to Neel Jain from Westview High School who won this year’s Congressional App Challenge for NW Oregon. His timely app, ""PDX Concierge,” will help people who are elderly or at risk of COVID-19 access free delivery of their groceries.
	•	Registered Apprenticeships are critical at a time when hundreds of thousands of people are out of a job because of the coronavirus pandemic. I am pleased the House passed a bill I sponsored to create nearly one million new Registered Apprenticeship, youth apprenticeship, and pre-apprenticeship positions.
	•	The Trump administration is continuing its attempts to undermine the work of our government agencies and scientists to respond to the climate crisis. I’m continuing the fight to defend science.
	•	This is a critical time for access to health care. The pandemic continues, and many people have experienced changes in their employment. You and your loved ones can sign up for a new health insurance plan through Dec. 15.

2/7/21 10:18,Update on COVID Spending Proposals,"Update on COVID 
Spending Proposals
Congress has spent an unprecedented amount of taxpayer money - approximately $4 trillion - on COVID-19 relief aid. The staggering amount is on par with the size of the entire annual federal budget and is equal to about a quarter of our entire annual economy. Moreover, billions of authorized aid remains unspent.
The economy has rebounded well since last April. The unemployment rate has fallen by more than half of what it was then and savings and disposable income rates are currently at or near record high levels. Another round of stimulus checks and other aid will not address the biggest problem facing Americans - concerns about traveling, socializing, and dining out during the pandemic. Getting the vaccine into peoples' arms as quickly as possible does. This is what the federal government must be focused on. Once we've made significant progress on this goal, then Congress can revisit what pockets of the economy still require assistance.
I hope you will take a few minutes to watch the floor speech I delivered this week about the next steps I think Congress should take when it comes to another COVID relief package.


Celebrating Catholic Schools
As a Catholic school parent and graduate, I know firsthand the great work they do. Not only do Catholic schools provide students with an exceptional education, but they help students build a foundation of values. This past year, they've faced unprecedented challenges due to COVID-19, but they've stepped up to provide students with a safe, flexible, and high-quality learning experience. I was proud to support a resolution this week to designate January 31-February 6 National Catholic Schools Week. 


Update on COVID-19
In the past few weeks, Pennsylvania and the rest of the country have experienced a concerning jump in new COVID-19 cases. While vaccines are now available, the threat of this virus is still very real.
It remains important that people continue to follow CDC recommendations: adhere to social distancing guidelines, wash your hands often, and wear a mask if you are heading out. Remember: my mask protects you and your mask protects me.
According to the Pennsylvania Department of Health, across the state as of Friday, February 5, 2021:
	•	Over 16% of all hospital beds were available (pre-COVID, approximately 36.82% of hospital beds were typically available)
	•	Over 73% of ventilators were available
	•	Over 19% of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds were available (pre-COVID, approximately 32.6% of ICU beds were typically available)
As of that date, positive cases in Pennsylvania reached 861,674, roughly a 0.5% increase from the prior day, and more than 3,678,224 tests had come back negative. This means just over 81% of Pennsylvanians tested for COVID-19 had a result that came back negative.

For more detailed information about resources available to you, visit the COVID-19 resource page on my website.

Futher Information:

The Centers for Disease Control provides updates on the virus and safety information for the public and healthcare professionals here.

The Pennsylvania Department of Health provides information on the virus and safety precautions here.

I encourage all Pennsylvanians to take this situation very seriously and observe the recommendations developed by the CDC.

Dear Friend, 

With COVID cases on the rise throughout the nation and here at home, I urge my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle and in both Chambers, to work together to pass a much-needed pandemic relief package. We need to make sure agencies tasked with combatting this virus (health departments, hospitals, senior living facilities, first responders, schools, etc.) have the resources needed to meet the challenges they are facing and keep Americans safe. We must also ensure a smooth and expedited distribution of vaccine(s) once approved. 

Additionally, we must help individuals and small businesses negatively impacted by the pandemic as we work to facilitate a full economic recovery.   There are reports that 60% of the small businesses that closed during the pandemic are now permanently closed – with thousands more set to close by the end of the year unless they receive help. The tragic part is that money is available to help them. We have $138 billion of unused dollars already allocated for the expired Paycheck Protection Program. We just have to approve the distribution. Also, the protections that were in place to help individuals who have lost their jobs and unable to find another one (extended unemployment benefits, moratoriums on evictions, etc.) are all set to run out.  

Millions of Americans and small businesses are on the brink and they need a lifeline. My colleagues and I continue to try to give them that lifeline through the discharge petition filed by Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler and signed by 186 Members of Congress, including me. Even 23 Democrats wrote to the Speaker in late September asking her to put a bipartisan package on the Floor for a vote. The situation has only grown more dire since then.  This should not be a partisan issue; we need to prioritize the health and well-being of all Americans during this difficult time. Americans and small businesses are hurting. We need to prioritize commonsense, bipartisan pandemic relief. I urge my colleagues to stop playing games and join me in this fight!  

Continue reading for a brief overview of my other efforts on your behalf last week.  



Keeping Americans Safe

It is great to see a second company applying for emergency use authorization from the FDA for a COVID-19 vaccine. Having a safe and effective vaccine readily available and distributed throughout the country will bring us one step closer to restoring our way of life. 

Here is some important information about how a COVID vaccine will be distributed once it is deemed safe and effective. Also, as noted in this article, the CDC Advisory Board has issued recommendations for how states should prioritize distribution of COVID-19 vaccine, once approved. Basically, the Board recommends that healthcare workers and those in long-term care facilities should be offered the first round of vaccine. Each state has been asked to submit its plan for distribution to the CDC by next week.   

The good news is that the scientific head of Operation Warp Speed, Dr. Moncef Slaoui, estimates that 70% of the U.S. population could be vaccinated by May of 2021 and that life could start getting back to normal at that time. There is light at the end of the tunnel.  



Advocating for our Nation's Heroes

The continued stalling by the Department of Defense and the VA in acknowledging the obvious link between service at this the K2 base in Uzbekistan and illness is delaying these Veterans gaining access to potentially life-saving medical treatment, which is unacceptable! I will continue my efforts to push them to do the right thing for these 15,000 men and women who were stationed there.  



While I am not happy to know that so many Veterans are in need of assistance, I am grateful that service organizations were able to provide help to them and their families over the holiday. We must continue our work to ensure Veterans have the opportunities for economic development as they transition to civilian life.  

Additionally, during last week’s VA Committee hearing we examined how Congress and the VA can change healthcare enrollment eligibility to better serve our nation’s heroes. Specifically, I asked how the VA could accommodate my proposed legislative changes designed to ensure Veterans exposed to burn pit toxins during their service have expanded access to the VA healthcare system.



Protecting Consumers 

Last week, the FCC implemented legislation I authored which prevents One-Ring Scams. This egregious form of robocall is more than just a nuisance; people using this scheme exploit and defraud the elderly and other vulnerable populations. I am glad to see the FCC fully implement our legislation and prevent this type of fraud. 



We also just finished National Tax Security Awareness Week. Unfortunately, there has been an increase in people seeking to exploit vulnerable populations throughout the pandemic. The IRS has provided these tips to help tax filers avoid becoming a victim of fraud. 



Community Connection 

I am fortunate to have a team that attends events, meets with constituents and helps me stay abreast of what is happening in our community. Here are just a few samples of events they attended in our community last week.

As a member of the Health Subcommittee, I am committed to making sure that all Americans have access to quality healthcare options. My team was able to participate in the groundbreaking of BayCare’s new hospital in Wesley Chapel. The hospital, which is slated to open in 2023, will offer comprehensive medical services and health care resources including: an emergency department, an intensive care unit, and diagnostic services, such as imaging and labs. Construction of the hospital will bring hundreds of jobs to the area. This project represents a $246 million investment to serve the growing health and wellness needs of this community.


My team was also honored to participate in the Grand Opening of Art to Gogh, Helena Demacopoulos’ unique mobile art business in Oldsmar. Welcome to the community and best wishes for success! 


Additionally, my team had the privilege of attending the RAW Space Collaborative Grand Opening in Wesley Chapel. This new business will serve as an asset to our growing community. Congratulations to owner, Mollyana Ward, and best wishes for a successful venture.



Constituent Corner

I recently received this note from a constituent who lives in Pasco County. 

Congressman, 

Thank you for going above and beyond to help me get unemployment benefits from the state. I have a small company and my industry has taken a huge hit due to the pandemic. I am a single father of two young boys who are completely dependent on me. For months, I tried unsuccessfully to navigate the tangled web of the state DEO, waiting on hold for hours only to be disconnected. I took small jobs to buy food and gas, but my savings was rapidly disappearing. I can't even begin to tell you how many nights I laid awake worrying about how we were going to survive. My neighbor mentioned that your office may be able to help. Within weeks of contacting your office, I had received my first round of benefits, and I just received a retroactive payment for all the months I had missed at the start of the pandemic. My industry is still not back to where it was prior to COVID, but we are slowly starting to rebound. These funds will help ensure that my family remains in our home and fed. I can't thank you enough for helping me get these funds. 

This is just one example of the work we do each day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!

Sincerely,


Gus Bilirakis

COVID-19 Vaccine
Operation Warp Speed has proven to be a tremendous success, and nothing short of a medical miracle, after the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization for it last week. This vaccine is safe and effective and will help us defeat COVID-19 and restore our way of life. While Pfizer did not accept Operation Warp Speed funding to develop their vaccine, they did enter into a purchase agreement with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to produce and distribute 100 million initial vaccine doses and up to 500 million additional doses. Many doses have already arrived and been administered in the First District! Thanks to the efforts of the Trump administration and countless health professionals and researchers, we will have 100 million doses of this vaccine for the most vulnerable populations.

4/25/21 10:02,This Week on Buddy's Briefing,"THIS WEEK ON BUDDY'S BRIEFING

This week, we filmed Buddy's Briefing in front of the Supreme Court as Democrats continue their mission to pack the court. For the last 152 years, nine Justices have sat on the Supreme Court. Now, Democrats are proposing legislation to radically expand that number to advance their liberal agenda. I signed a resolution to ensure the court stays at nine justices. 

Also this week, I supported a resolution introduced by Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy to censure Representative Maxine Waters for her recent comments in Minnesota. Rep. Waters has history of making comments to incite violence. She has told her followers to harass people and get confrontational before. This is dangerous and I stood this week to condemn the violent rhetoric.

We discuss this and more in this episode of Buddy's Briefing.

ANOTHER POWER GRAB

In another blatant attempt at a power grab, Democrats passed a bill this week to give D.C. statehood. This is yet another move by the Left to consolidate power and enact their radical policies. 




FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCCIX

Monday, April 19, 2021:  After attending the Chatham County Republican Party convention on Saturday, I was down in Darien in McIntosh County on Sunday for their annual Blessing of the Fleet.  For the past 53 years, shrimp boats have pulled up to the bridge on US 17 over the Darien River in order to receive a blessing from various pastors of different denominations for a bountiful harvest and safe season.

BROADBAND 
Take a Speed Test Here. 
The sad fact is that many places in West Virginia simply do not have access to reliable broadband and the lack of access affects West Virginians every day. Back in 2015, the FCC released a coverage map that stated 99.9% of Americans had wireless coverage. I knew then what I know now: That is just plain wrong.

MANCHIN OPPOSES OMB DIRECTOR NOMINEE NEERA TANDEN   Charleston, WV – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) released the following statement on his decision to oppose Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director nominee Neera Tanden.   “I have carefully reviewed Neera Tanden’s public statements and tweets that were personally directed towards my colleagues on both sides of the aisle from Senator Sanders to Senator McConnell and others. I believe her overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next director of the Office of Management and Budget. For this reason, I cannot support her nomination. As I have said before, we must take meaningful steps to end the political division and dysfunction that pervades our politics. At a time of grave crisis, it is more important than ever that we chart a new bipartisan course that helps address the many serious challenges facing our nation.""

Nominated as today’s Better Angel is Drew Massey, Director of Pharmacy for Fruth Pharmacy.  Drew has administered shots in nursing homes, schools and other events. He has worked late into the evening, driving to homes of elderly West Virginians to put extra doses to the best use. He spent two days administering vaccines in rural areas of Putnam County to shut-in patients, many confined to bed. A compassionate and caring pharmacist, Drew has led the Fruth vaccine program and made sure that not one dose has been wasted. After a recent ice storm, with a clinic scheduled in Point Pleasant, Drew hand-carried the vaccine from his home and caught a ride to deliver the medication. Drew, you have gone above and beyond the call of duty. On behalf of your colleagues and the families you have served, thank you for your selfless and determined efforts. 

Please continue sharing your stories of hope, joy, and volunteerism by emailing your nomination and a photo to WVSTRONG@manchin.senate.gov . 
  
WORKING FOR YOU
MANCHIN ANNOUNCES TWO WEST VIRGINIA HEALTH CENTER SYSTEMS TO RECEIVE COVID-19 VACCINE ALLOCATION SOON, STATE RECEIVING ANOTHER WEEKLY DOSE INCREASE  Charleston, WV – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) announced that two West Virginia health center systems, Valley Health Systems and Shenandoah Valley Medical System, will soon be receiving direct COVID-19 vaccine dose shipments through the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) COVID-19 Vaccination Program. COVID-19 vaccines provided to community health centers under this program are separate from the state’s weekly allocation, and will increase the overall vaccine supply in the state. Senator Manchin also received notification that West Virginia will receive a 7,000 dose increase in the Pfizer vaccine weekly allocation, the 4th weekly allocation increase in a row for the state.  ""Today I received notification that two West Virginia health center systems will soon be receiving direct shipments of COVID-19 vaccine doses to administer to West Virginians. West Virginia continues to lead the nation in vaccination efforts and our health centers have been integral to the distribution program. The HRSA COVID-19 Vaccination Program is aimed at ensuring equitable vaccine distribution across the state and our health centers, who serve roughly 27 percent of West Virginians, are well equipped to do just that. Vaccines are essential to defeating this horrible virus and I am incredibly pleased that our health centers have been chosen to receive doses directly. I am also pleased West Virginia will be receiving another weekly vaccine allocation increase from Pfizer, increasing the state’s ability to vaccinate more West Virginians. As vaccine production continues to increase, I will continue to work with the Biden Administration to quickly procure enough doses for every West Virginian who wants to be vaccinated,"" said Senator Manchin.

IRS: 
IRS has a new Unemployment Benefits ID theft page that links from Identity Theft Central . 
Scammers took advantage of the pandemic by filing fraudulent claims for unemployment compensation using stolen personal information of individuals who had not filed claims. Anyone whose personal information was stolen and used for this purpose should be aware of the following: 
	•	Taxpayers who receive an incorrect Form 1099-G for unemployment benefits they did not receive should contact the issuing state agency to request a revised Form 1099-G showing they did not receive these benefits.
	•	Taxpayers who are unable to obtain a timely, corrected form from states should still file an accurate tax return, reporting only the income they received.
	•	Taxpayers do not need to file a Form 14039, Identity Theft Affidavit, with the IRS regarding an incorrect Form 1099-G. The identity theft affidavit should be filed only if the taxpayer’s e-filed return is rejected because a return using the same Social Security number has already been filed.
	•	The IRS previously issued guidance requested by states, see Identity theft guidance regarding unemployment compensation reporting. No Forms 1099-G should be issued to those individuals the states have identified as ID theft victims.

Dear ,
I invite you to join me and Congresswoman Deborah Ross (NC-02) for a COVID-19 Relief Virtual Town Hall, on Thursday, January 28 from 5:30-6:30 p.m.   We will discuss the provisions included in the most recent COVID-19 federal relief package passed in December, including support for small businesses, enhanced weekly federal unemployment insurance, $600 direct checks, new federal rental assistance funds, additional resources for vaccine distribution, and more. We also will discuss President Biden’s COVID-19 relief proposal: the American Rescue Plan. There will also be an opportunity for us to directly answer your questions and share available resources.
Sign up for the COVID-19 Relief Virtual Town Hall
After months of harmful delay by congressional Republicans, Congress passed a bipartisan COVID-19 relief package at the end of December.  Despite my strong preference for a more robust package, I voted for this agreement because the needs were simply too urgent and too immense to do nothing or to wait any longer.  Unfortunately, we are many months from returning to ‘normal’, and Congress must begin working with the Biden administration on additional relief packages to ensure a full recovery occurs as soon as possible. 
COVID-19 cases are increasing rapidly in North Carolina and around the country. We all must take serious precautions to slow the spread. While it is encouraging that two safe and effective vaccines have been approved, we still have a long recovery ahead of us. This virtual town hall will allow us to provide an overview of federal COVID-19 relief efforts and directly answer your questions.
Please confirm your attendance in advance by registering here. If you are unable to join the virtual event, you can watch the discussion live on my Facebook page.  
We look forward to seeing you on Thursday, January 28th.
Sincerely, 

David Price

GET VACCINATED!

Half of all United States adults have now received at least one COVID-19 shot thanks to the expansion of vaccines under the American Rescue Plan. 

As of April 12, all Illinois residents 16 years of age and older are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. 

Here's your latest news on vaccines in IL-03:

Chicago: All city mass vaccination sites will accept walk-in appointments. If you still want to schedule an appointment, do so through zocdoc.com/vaccine or by calling 312-746-4835. 

Cook County: Starting this week, Cook County's mass COVID vaccination sites will begin accepting walk-ins. Appointments can still be made online or by calling 833-308-1988. 

Will County: Residents in Will County looking for the vaccine but are unable to leave their homes due to a medical condition can request to get vaccinated through the county health department. Residents can apply by clicking here. For general information on receiving a vaccine in Will County, please visit willcountyhealth.org. 

DuPage County: Residents in DuPage County looking to find vaccination appointments can visit here. If you need assistance with registration, please call (630) 682-7400. 

General Assistance: To help eligible Illinois residents secure a coveted COVID-19 vaccine appointment, the State has launched a hotline for people who don’t have access to the internet or who have trouble making appointments online. To make a COVID-19 vaccine appointment, call 833-621-1284. For more information about the coronavirus and vaccine, call 800-889-3931 or email DPH.SICK@illinois.gov. 




FIGHTING FOR OUR SMALL BUSINESSES

This month, the House passed TWO of my bipartisan bills that will make the process of applying for microloans easier, faster and more transparent for all small business owners. 

I'm proud to have passed this legislation, which will further ensure financial support for the smallest of our small businesses so they can not only survive this pandemic but bring back their workers and help reignite our economy.

Read more about my bills here.




FIGHTING FOR OUR WORKERS

Last week, I joined One Fair Wage to step into the shoes of a restaurant server as part of an effort to show that it's way past time our workers earn a living wage. 

I continue to urge the Senate to pass the Raise the Wage Act to eliminate the subminimum wage for workers and raise the minimum wage to $15.




SUPPORTING OUR VENUES

I worked to appropriate additional funds to the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program in the #AmericanRescuePlan. 

This week, the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant portal reopened to provide venue operators in danger of closing with access to relief. This program will provide over $16 billion in relief to struggling independent venues.

If you operate a struggling independent venue, I encourage you to apply by clicking here. 


FIGHTING FOR EQUAL PAY


The wage gap between men and women isn't just a national issue — it's a local problem. In IL-03, women earn just 82 cents for every $1 earned by men. And for just women of color — this pay gap is even worse. This month, I voted to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, which strengthens the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and eliminates pay disparities between men and women. 

Passing this legislation would not be enough alone, we also have to ensure workers are aware of their rights under this legislation. That is why my amendment in this bill requires employers to display a poster in their workplace and on their employment website, so workers clearly understand their rights under this Act.

Read more about my amendment that passed with the Paycheck Fairness Act here.

A SOBERING MILESTONE AND RELIEF ON THE HORIZON
Dear friend, 
This weekend marks a year since the first known COVID-19 death in the U.S. was announced in our community. My heart breaks when I reflect on all that we have lost this year—over 500,000 lives with families, stories, and potential. 
We cannot go back in time, but we can act urgently to save lives and support Americans who are struggling during this economic and public health crisis. The first step is successfully passing the American Rescue Plan, which is estimated to speed up our national recovery by a year. 
Last night, I voted to pass this relief package, which now moves over to the Senate. With enhanced federal unemployment benefits set to expire on March 14, I urge my colleagues to act swiftly to avoid causing undue suffering for those who are relying on federal relief programs to get by. We were sent to Washington on the promise of delivering more relief and that’s what we need to do. 
The bill includes:
	•	A one-year expansion of the Child Tax Credit, legislation I introduced to help rebuild our middle class. The expansion will provide qualifying families with regular payments and make the benefit fully available to lower-income families. I will continue to fight for a permanent expansion of the credit, which is estimated to cut child poverty nearly in half.
	•	An additional $1,400 in direct assistance for qualifying Americans, bringing the total to $2,000 per person with what we approved in December.
	•	A national vaccination strategy and $160 billion to get shots out faster and improve testing.
	•	An increase in enhanced federal unemployment assistance to $400 per week and extension through August.
	•	$130 billion to help safely reopen our schools.
	•	Expanded small business lending programs like PPP.  
You can find out more about the plan here. 
As always, I am here to help you. If you need assistance at this difficult time, please do not hesitate to contact my Kirkland office at (425) 485-0085. For more updates on what I’m doing for WA-01, you can follow me on social media at the links above.
Stay safe and stay healthy,
Suzan

Dear neighbor,  
This week we hit a new milestone, with over 200 million vaccine shots administered within the first 100 days of the Biden Administration. This is great news and a sign that the American Rescue Plan is working. However, COVID-19 is still a serious public health challenge. We must continue to do what we can to keep safe and wash our hands frequently, engage in social distancing, and wear a mask in public. My heart goes out to anyone who has lost a loved one to this terrible disease. If you have suffered a loss, you may be eligible for the COVID-19 Funeral Assistance Program. FEMA is providing financial assistance for COVID-19 related funeral expenses incurred after January 20th, 2020. For more information on the program, please visit fema.gov/disasters/coronavirus/economic/funeral-assistance.  

 
  
Vaccine Distribution in LA County 
Adults age 16 and older who live or work in LA County are eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. If you haven’t done so already, I strongly encourage you to get the vaccine as soon as you are able. Walk-in registration spots are being offered at all County-run mass vaccination sites through Monday, April 26th while supply lasts – no appointment needed. 
 
To book an appointment in Los Angeles County, please go to VaccinateLACounty.com or Coronavirus.LACity.org/VaxAppointment. If you have a disability or do not have access to the internet and need assistance making your vaccination appointment, you can contact the County’s Call Center –– open from 8:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. –– at (833) 540-0473. The vaccine is free to all people and immigration status and insurance are not required. 
If you are age 16 or 17, you are only eligible to receive the Pfizer vaccine. Please book your vaccination appointment at a site that offers Pfizer. You will be turned away if you go to a site that doesn’t offer Pfizer. In addition, minors must bring a parent or guardian with them to receive the vaccine. For now, the pause on the use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine remains in place out of an abundance of caution. To learn more about the pause, please click here. The LA County Department of Public Health will be holding a virtual town hall to answer questions about the COVID-19 vaccines on Tuesday, April 27th. Please submit your questions here and watch at 6 p.m. PT on Twitter, YouTube, or Facebook at @lapublichealth.  
Help is on the Way for Local Communities in California 
Throughout COVID-19, local communities have been under unprecedented strain, with many having to lay off educators, firefighters, and other essential workers, or failing to provide the services communities rely on. Fortunately, Help is Here with the American Rescue Plan, which will provide California with $18.5 billion in local fiscal relief to help local communities recover. Specifically, this funding will go toward enabling local governments to continue to support the public health response, address the losses in revenues they’ve experienced as a result of this crisis, provide premium pay for essential workers to avoid layoffs, and more. 
 
Below are estimates of how much each city in California’s 33rd Congressional District will receive through the American Rescue Plan.

12/23/20 15:11,Have a safe and happy holiday,"December 23, 2020
 
 
Dear Friend,
 
From my family to yours, Happy Holidays! This has been a very difficult year for everyone, but all is not lost. Kindness, generosity, and good cheer – the spirit of the season – are still alive and well. In addition, there is a light at the end of the tunnel of the COVID-19 crisis with the authorization of two vaccines — most recently, the Moderna vaccine. However, now is not the time to let down our guard against this virus. Until these vaccines are widely available, we must continue taking precautions including wearing masks, staying home if we are sick, maintaining physical distance from others, and frequently washing our hands. 
 Staying apart from those we love is especially difficult now during the holiday season, but it is critical that we keep ourselves and others safe by avoiding travel if possible, celebrating at home with the people we live with, skipping large holiday gatherings, and finding ways to safely celebrate virtually or outdoors. For more information on how to celebrate the holidays safely, visit CDC.gov. 
 
 
 
Passing Bipartisan COVID-19 Relief
 
 
 
 

 
 
I’m pleased the House and Senate came to an agreement this week to pass much-needed COVID-19 relief, fund the government and prevent a shutdown.This legislation was long overdue, and though it does not include everything we have been fighting for over the past months, the legislation passed will provide critical support for our health care systems and vaccine distribution capacity, increased funding for small businesses, and will extend unemployment benefits for Granite Staters who are out of work. I am pleased that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle included key New Hampshire priorities that I advocated for, including bolstered funding for job-creating projects through the Northern Border Regional Commission, additional help for small farms as well as families struggling with food insecurity, increased funding for mental health and addiction treatment, and new housing support for low-income families and survivors of sexual violence. I’m also glad this legislation included vaccine distribution funding modeled after a bill I led earlier this year with Congressman Hakeem Jeffries. This bill would require that the vaccine be distributed equitably across the country to ensure that rural and low income communities receive their fair share.

While this package will bring some help to those who need it most, we must remember that it is not a fix-all solution. Far too many have lost their jobs, are struggling to get by, cannot find quality, affordable child care, or cannot return to work because of concerns for their health. Congress must continue working to ensure no one is left behind, and I will keep urging my colleagues to advance legislation that addresses budget shortfalls at the town and county level. With vaccines being distributed in New Hampshire and across the country, this legislation is a positive step as we work to put COVID-19 behind us. 
 The legislation was sent to President Trump’s desk, but he is now calling for what Democrats have demanded for months — more relief for struggling American families — before he signs the bill. The $600 payments in the legislation we just passed were a compromise — not nearly enough, but Republicans in Congress blocked our efforts for robust COVID relief. For months, we have been fighting for additional relief that focuses on the needs of the American people. This bill was a down payment — not a long-term solution. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will agree to amend the bill to include higher direct economic impact payments and join us in putting those facing the greatest challenges first.
 
 
 
Helping Live Venues and Performance Spaces Stay Afloat 
 
 
I applaud the inclusion and passage of key provisions of the Save Our Stages Act, which I cosponsored, as part of a new Shuttered Venue Operator grant program in the COVID relief and omnibus spending package. The coronavirus pandemic and necessary public health measures have taken a tremendous financial toll on our state, and our live music and performance industry have been hit particularly hard. Independent live music venues and the performance industry employ thousands of Granite Staters, and it's past time we provide much-needed support to these businesses. In addition to providing general enjoyment to the public, these venues also play a meaningful role in the economic wellbeing of communities in New Hampshire and across the country.
I’m proud this beneficial legislation was included in the omnibus spending package and look forward to continuing to support our performance industry and working to bring support to those who need it in New Hampshire.
 
 

 
 
Safe, Effective Vaccines
 
 
As I’ve said in the past—a safe, effective vaccine that enjoys the full confidence of the American public is one of our best defenses against the COVID-19 pandemic. We must ensure that these vaccines are distributed efficiently and equitably and that the public trusts their safety and efficacy.
 
President-elect Joe Biden, Dr. Jill Biden and Dr. Anthony Fauci led by example this week when they received their first doses of the COVID-19 vaccines. Thanks to the hard work and dedication of our scientists and doctors, we have a safe and effective vaccine that we can trust.
 
 
 
Authorizing the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine
 
 The FDA emergency use authorization of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is great news for New Hampshire and rural communities across the country. The Moderna vaccine, because it is easier to transport and store, will expand the settings where it can be used and distributed to include rural areas and pharmacies or medical offices that lack specialized equipment like ultra-low temperature refrigerators. Ensuring the COVID-19 vaccines are accessible is key to ending this pandemic, and with Moderna's FDA authorization, we are one step closer.
 
 
 
Sending Merry Wishes to Our Troops
 
 It was wonderful to join Dr. Laura Landerman-Garber’s Holiday Card Challenge For Our Military again this year. Our brave men and women in uniform sacrifice so much for us and our country, and many are spending the holidays away from their families - I can think of no better way to celebrate than thanking them for their service and sending them merry wishes! 
 
 

  
Writing holiday messages to our troops!
 
 
 
Honoring Christa McAuliffe's Legacy
 
 Christa McAuliffe was a smart, charming, and kind educator who left her mark on countless students by encouraging them to seek out the best in themselves and always reach a little higher. The Christa McAuliffe Commemorative Coin will honor her enduring legacy and benefit Dean Kamen’s FIRST to engage and inspire young people to become leaders in STEM fields. Christa represented the best of New Hampshire and this coin will help to cement her place in American history for generations to come. 
 
 
 

 
 
 
News You Can Use 
 
 
COVID-19 infections are rising rapidly in New Hampshire and across the country. While it’s important to remember that many people who get the virus never develop symptoms, you can protect yourself and your loved ones by understanding how the virus spreads, recognizing common symptoms and warning signs, and by taking the recommended precautions. 
 
As always, the CDC and the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services are the best resources to turn to during the COVID-19 public health emergency. If you are sick, stay home and call your health care provider. If you live in NH and have questions about coronavirus, dial 211 or visit CDC.gov for more information.
 
To stay updated on my work in Congress and around the Granite State, as well as for important information and resources, like my page on Facebook and follow me on Twitter. 
 
Remember: hope and brighter days are on the way! We’re all in this together, and we will come out stronger on the other side. In the meantime, I hope you have a fun and safe holiday, and don’t forget to wear a mask when you are in public. Here’s to 2021!
 
Sincerely,
 
 
Annie

5/5/21 10:19,Reacting to President Biden's Address to the Joint Session of Congress,"Reacting to President Biden's Address to the Joint Session of Congress
At his Inauguration, President Biden called for national unity while stressing that he would be a president for all Americans - not just those who supported him. To date, these words have rung hollow. The Biden White House has focused most of its energy on forcing through aspects of the left-wing wish list, either by executive order or partisan legislation, while stonewalling most Republican ideas and input. This week's announcement of a new, dramatic, and costly expansion of the welfare state - paid for by massive tax increases - is yet another example of this hyper-partisan approach that the Biden administration has deployed since January.
I do not expect to agree with President Biden on most policy issues. But there are areas we can work together, including rebuilding our roads and bridges, expanding firearm background checks, and forging new free trade agreements. I have made this clear to the president and his team and I hope he will take me and other Republicans who have done the same up on our offers.

Stay in Touch:   
    
Dear Friend:
 
Last night the House of Representatives and the Senate passed a COVID-19 relief bill that contains long-overdue assistance for families, first responders, frontline workers, small businesses, and health care workers in need.
 
I'll be honest with you. It's not the bill I would have written. I think $600 checks are woefully inadaquate for the millions of families in our country that are in dire need right now. I would have liked to see much greater support for local resturaunts, more rental assistance, and an extension of the unemployment benefits offered under the CARES Act.
 
But there were many parts of the bill I supported. I'm proud that I was able to secure a 15% increase in monthly benefits and an additional $13 billion to support the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), our nation's premier anti-hunger program, as well as more funding for food banks and child nutrition programs. I was also glad to see additional funding for the Paycheck Protection Program, vaccine distribution, and incentives for employers to provide paid sick leave.
 
As a Member of Congress, you don't get to vote ""maybe"" — you vote yes or no, knowing that you can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. That's why I voted yes on this package. You can watch my floor speech about the bill below.
 
 

 
 
The reality is that even though I've voted twice since May for relief packages that meet the scale and scope of the crisis we’re in, we simply don't have partners in the Senate who share our values and who are willing to get a more robust package across the finish line.
 
Here are some of the key provisions contained in our relief legislation:
 
Direct Payments: Despite our best efforts, Senate Republicans refused to agree to another round of $1,200 payments. We secured $600 payments per person plus an additional $600 per child.
 
Unemployment: Senate Republicans refused to accept a simple extension of unemployment benefits from the CARES Act. The package we passed averts the sudden expiration of unemployment insurance benefits for millions and adds a $300/week enhancement.
 
Food Assistance: I successfully fought for $13 billion in increased SNAP and child nutrition benefits to help relieve the historic hunger crisis that has left up to 17 million children food insecure.
 
Rental Assistance: We fought to keep $25 billion in funding in the package to get rental assistance to families struggling to keep a roof over their heads.
 
Eviction Moratorium: Our bill also extends the federal eviction moratorium into the next administration, when it can be extended.
 
Paid Sick Leave: To ensure that workers aren’t punished for getting sick or having to take time off to care for a sick relative, the package incentivizes employers to offer paid sick leave.
 
Small Business Relief: The package reinvests in the Paycheck Protection Program to make sure businesses in need of a first or second round of relief have access to the funds they need. It also sets aside funding to specifically assist minority owned small businesses and businesses in lower-income communities that may have been left behind earlier in the pandemic.
 
Vaccine Distribution: The bill contains $20 billion to support the purchasing of COVID-19 vaccines and $9 billion to ensure that they are distributed as quickly and as equitably as possible.
 
Education: Democrats fought to invest $54 billion in public K-12 schools, including support specifically for HVAC repair and replacement to mitigate virus transmission and reopen classrooms safely.
 
Child Care: To help get parents back to work once it’s safe, we fought for $10 billion for child care assistance and to keep child care facilities open.
 
Ending Harmful Surprise Billing: This package also puts an end to the harmful practice of surprise billing that can cause families to unknowingly go tens of thousands of dollars into debt simply for seeking medical care, even if they have health insurance.
 
This bill provides desperately-needed assistance to everyday people confronting homelessness, hunger, and unemployment. But it's merely a downpayment on what needs to happen next. It leaves critical needs unmet, and there will be much more work to do in the weeks and months ahead.   I am committed to fighting for our district as we face this challenge together. 
 
And everyone in my office is ready to help in any way we can.  Please do not hesitate to call us to share your thoughts or get help—that is what we are here for.
 
Sincerely,

Dear friend,
Encouraging news continues to come our way as San Diego County finds itself in the orange tier, a category with fewer restrictions and capacity limits, as the case rate has remained under six cases per every 100,000 residents for the last two weeks. In addition, Governor Newsom announced that the state's economy is looking to fully reopen on June 15th if vaccine supply is sufficient and hospitalizations remain low.
Please remain vigilant as we approach the end of this devastating pandemic. Wear a mask, wash your hands, and practice social distancing.
This week, I continued my work here in San Diego. Below is another update on some of the work my staff and I have done this week to serve you.

Virtual press conference on the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act

On Tuesday, I participated in a press conference on this significant climate change proposal with Reps. Ted Deutch (FL-22), Judy Chu (CA-27) and Charlie Crist (FL-13.) The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act would put a price on carbon and return 100% of the net revenue as a rebate to American families. This legislation seeks to reduce U.S. carbon pollution by up to 45% by 2030, with a net zero target by 2050 by pricing carbon at $15 per metric ton of CO2e and increasing the price by $10 every year. Click here to watch the press conference.

District work
Virtual Discussion on the SBA's Shuttered Venue Operators Grant Program

This week, I held a virtual discussion to announce the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant Program. Last month, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act, which created several programs to help both employers and employees withstand the impact of this once-in-a generation pandemic. The Shuttered Venue Operators Grant program is a $15 billion dollar grant fund for music venues, movie and live theaters, performing arts operators, and talent representatives, along with some museums, aquariums and zoos.
During this event, we heard directly from the U.S. Small Business Administration about this program and application process. Local owners and operators, including Martha Gilmer from the San Diego Symphony, Joe Rinaldi from Music Box and Adolfo Fastlicht from TheLot shared how COVID-19 has impacted them and why this assistance is so urgently needed. As we recover from this crisis, I'm committed to help my constituents understand the benefits available to them. Find more information on this grant here. If you missed this event, click here to watch.
Meeting with Afira DeVries, CEO of Monarch School Project 
On Monday, I met with Afira DeVries, who became the CEO of Monarch School Project last August. Monarch has served San Diego homeless youth for over thirty years. We spoke about how trauma-informed interactions with students help their learning. We also discussed how the educational model employed at the Monarch School can be scaled across the nation to support vulnerable children.
Meeting with Evofem Biosciences

Also on Tuesday, I met with the CEO and team of Evofem Biosciences, a biopharmaceutical company located in the 52nd district. Their hormone-free birth control product, Phexxi, has been on the market since last May, but does not fall under any of the current categories on the Federal Drug Administration's (FDA) published contraceptive chart. Updating this chart with a new category would increase access to Phexxi, especially for women who are unable to take hormones or for those who seek an alternative to birth control with hormones. As a longtime advocate for a woman’s right to choose, I know that access to contraceptives remains an essential tool to securing the health and economic well-being of American women and their families.

This week's casework success story
Last month, Izzy from Mira Mesa contacted my office for assistance with his expedited passport renewal. He had applied for an expedited renewal ahead of an upcoming travel date, but then learned that the Department of State was overwhelmed. When he reached out to the State Department for assistance, they suggested he book an emergency appointment locally. With his travel date one week away, Izzy reached out to my office for assistance. My staff submitted Izzy's proof of travel plans as part of an inquiry to the National Passport Information Center. Three days later, the Information Center notified my office that the request was processed successfully, and Izzy received his passport in the mail the very next day.

""I cannot express in words how grateful my partner and I are for Congressman Scott Peters and his office’s help in getting my passport issued in time. The level of responsiveness and care we were given is something we truly take to heart.""
- Izzy from Mira Mesa

ICYMI: Fighting to Provide Direct Relief to American Families
Last week, I introduced bipartisan legislation calling for immediate relief for families.

American families are struggling and need immediate relief. More than half of households have reported major financial challenges due to the economic and public health crisis. By providing a second round of individual relief, millions of American families would receive the help they need to get through the holiday season. As Congress continues to negotiate additional COVID-19 relief measures, we must prioritize family-focused direct assistance to those who need it most.

The Coronavirus Assistance for American Families Act would:
	•	Disburse Economic Impact Payments of $1,000 for both adults and children with social security numbers (SSNs) equally, $2,000 if filing jointly. A family of four would receive $4,000, which is $600 more than they received under the CARES Act.
	•	Includes eligibility for adult dependents, including those with disabilities or college students.
	•	Includes eligibility for U.S. citizens married to foreign nationals but does not include eligibility for foreign nationals or ITIN filers.
A one-pager can be found here.   For more information on the bill, click here. 

COVID-19 Vaccine
Thrilled to see the first Pfizer vaccine administered this week in the United States. Due to Operation Warp Speed, we can begin distributing this vaccine across the country.
Thank you to the researchers, doctors, trial volunteers, military personnel, and other medical professionals for making this possible!
To watch the first COVID vaccine being administered, click here. 

Working to Improve Nursing Home Care 
Today, I introduced bipartisan legislation to protect long-term care residents and enhance accountability among the nation’s worst-performing facilities. The Nursing Home Reform Modernization Act of 2020 will expand the SFF program and ensure that all facilities nominated for the program receive additional oversight, enforcement, and technical assistance.

The COVID pandemic has shed a light on the need to improve the quality of care in nursing homes and long-term care facilities. Since the start of the pandemic, more than 300 West Virginia residents and staff in nursing homes and long-term care facilities have lost their lives to the virus. Our bipartisan bill will provide greater oversight and resources to underperforming facilities to ensure our vulnerable seniors and veterans receive the quality of care they deserve. We have a duty to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and keep our seniors safe.

CDC Recommendation
We encourage everyone to follow the CDC recommendations on how to help protect yourself and others.

Take these steps to protect yourself:

100 DAYS DELIVERING FOR YOU
 
  
Dear Neighbor,
 
The past 100 days have been filled with struggle, grief, and profound loss. As a community and nation, we saw darkness. But we are finally beginning to see the light.
 
In mid-March, the American Rescue Plan was signed into law. Since then, hundreds of thousands of upstate residents have received their vaccinations. Millions of Americans have gotten their stimulus checks. Small businesses are reopening. Job growth is rising. Students are returning to their classrooms.
 
In the past 100 days, I've: 

	•	Secured over $400 Million for NY-19 local governments via my Direct Support for Communities Act funding formula
	•	Recovered $253,000 for NY-19 families from the federal government
	•	Been selected Chairman of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit
	•	Visited all 11 counties in NY-19 
	•	Held 4 town halls
	•	Held 5 NY-19 Advisory Committee meetings
	•	Attended 150+ meetings and virtual visits
	•	Introduced 13 bills/amendments
	•	Passed 5 bills/amendments through the House of Representatives
	•	Had 2 bills/amendments signed into law
	•	Sent 36,749 constituent responses
	•	Closed 325 constituent cases
	•	Launched the bipartisan Delaware River Watershed Caucus
 

  
I was proud to play an instrumental role in the passage of this historic legislation. My Direct Support for Communities Act funding formula, included in the American Rescue Plan, will deliver $130.2 billion to local governments across the United States -- including over $400 million to New York's 19th Congressional District.
 
In addition to the American Rescue Plan, I've been working hard to improve the lives and livelihoods of upstate folks. I introduced legislation to deliver affordable health care, support our farmers, improve broadband access, address the opioid crisis, and more.
 
As we recover from COVID-19 and begin to rebuild, I'll will keep working to deliver investment in our communities through infrastructure and job creation. I hope you and your loved ones are staying safe and healthy, and I am looking forward to connecting with you all in person soon.
 
Sincerely,
 
Antonio

5/21/21 16:49,A Doctor's Note on what is happening in Washington,"May 21, 2021 
Dear Friends, 
Today, Washington, D.C. lifted all capacity restrictions except for bars and nightclubs which can operate at 50% occupancy until June 11th. In case you missed it, Speaker Nancy Pelosi extended proxy voting, and the House Democratic Leadership is still mandating masks, regardless of vaccination status, on the House Floor and in committee rooms.  
A good majority of Members are fully vaccinated. Continuing this policy, not only creates further public distrust of the COVID-19 vaccines, but it prevents Members from building and strengthening relationships. I join the GOP Doctors Caucus in issuing a statement condemning these guidelines. The Caucus with Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy put forward a privileged House Resolution calling for the House of Representatives to return to normal.  
Wednesday morning I reminded Maria Bartiromo on Mornings with Maria about an April 21st letter the Caucus sent asking Speaker Pelosi to trust the science and return the House of Representatives to regular order. Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its mask guidance to state that those who are fully vaccinated can resume normal activities without wearing a mask and social distancing.  


 Washington Recap:   
Last Friday, the BIG Act passed the House. The BIG Act is critical legislation that will equip schools and communities with the tools they need to ensure the safety and health of each student. By providing schools with best practices for behavioral health intervention training and services, we can work to prevent further tragedy from happening.  
I teamed up with Representative Lou Correa (D-CA) to introduce H.R. 3021 - the Coronavirus Provider Protection Act. If passed, this bipartisan legislation ensures that doctors and nurses are protected while they continue to protect us from COVID-19. 
After the news broke about the Colonial Pipeline Company ransomware hack, I wrote a letter to President Joe Biden and to Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone. In both letters to President Biden and Chairman Pallone, I sought answers on the Administration’s response, how this can be prevented in the future, and requested a classified briefing for Energy and Commerce Committee Members from the Department of Energy.  
I introduced the Public Health Workforce Loan Repayment Act with Representatives Jason Crown (D-CO), Anna Eshoo (D-CA), and Brett Guthrie (R-KY). Funding the Public Health Workforce Loan Repayment Program provides vital resources to grow and strengthen our public health workforce at the local, state, and tribal levels. This bill will enable these public health departments to enhance their workforce, thereby improving our nation’s overall preparedness and response capabilities to current and future public health emergencies.  
Finally, I introduced the Contact Lens Prescription Verification Modernization Act (H.R. 3353) alongside Representatives Bobby L. Rush (D-Ill.), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.), and David B. McKinley (R-W.Va.). If passed, H.R. 3353 would provide new protections to consumers by banning the use of robocalls, requiring online retailers to provide an online portal for consumers to upload their prescriptions, and requiring that all medical information sent in emails is encrypted.  
Coming Up:   
Next week is a Committee Work Week. 
Until next time, this is your doctor's note.   Congressman Michael C. Burgess, M.D.

Holding the Line Against COVID-19

Friends,

I spent this week home in the Lowcountry with entrepreneurs, business leaders, and employees all working around the clock to keep their doors open despite the immense challenges they face with COVID-19. They shared their determination to get past this virus and finally get the country moving again.

I’m more determined than ever to make sure their hard work isn’t undermined by Washington. This starts with making sure we’re doing everything we can to beat COVID-19 once and for all.

In light of this, I was disappointed in the Biden administration’s recent alarming signals that it will limit -- and in some cases stop -- border enforcement measures. Not only is this a clear message to the international community that our immigration laws can be violated with no recourse, but it also risks exasperating an already terrible health emergency as numbers in detainment centers grow.

Americans are still struggling to make ends meet under crippling pandemic restrictions. Local, state, and federal authorities are still overwhelmed in their effort to deliver the vaccine to the millions of Americans who need it most. Most children are being kept from returning to school, despite the CDC and other medical experts repeatedly assuring us they're safe to reopen. Congress is preparing to spend trillions of dollars we simply don’t have.

Amid all of this, we cannot risk a new COVID-19 crisis on our southern border. We’ve made too many sacrifices and worked too hard to get to where we are now. We can’t undo this progress, not when we’re finally starting to turn the corner.

This is why I joined with my colleagues on the House Oversight Committee to warn the Biden administration of the unacceptable risks of their reckless decisions, and to demand transparency for the American people. 

You can read our letter HERE.

The Biden administration seems to be more willing to open up our borders than our schools. Their priorities are completely backwards, but mine are not.

My primary mission right now is to help finally end this pandemic so the people of the Lowcountry can finally get back to living their lives. We will defeat this virus! 

Sincerely,

 

Congresswoman Nancy Mace

Congresswoman Lesko Weekly Update
Good afternoon, 
This week, I was in Washington, D.C. for another busy week of votes in the U.S. House of Representatives, where one of my bills passed by Unanimous Consent! I also spoke with the Women’s Congressional Policy Institute on global maternal mortality and what can be done to protect women and babies around the world. I also had a call with mayors and city officials in our district. We discussed what I'm doing in Washington, D.C. and the latest updates on the COVID-19 vaccine, as well as the issues facing each city due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I also had a call with the U.S. Coast Guard about what they are doing at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy to combat bullying and harassment, an important measure to ensure students’ safety and wellbeing. I attended a meeting with Walmart, CVS, Walgreens, and other retail companies to discuss organized retail crime, as well as how they are working with states to distribute the Coronavirus vaccine. I also attended a press conference with other Republican members of Congress to stand up for America’s workers and small business owners and fight to release unused Paycheck Protection Program funds to deliver critical relief. 
Legislative Update
I am very pleased to tell you that my bill to rename a U.S. Post Office in Surprise, AZ after Navy SEAL Marc Lee passed the U.S. House of Representatives by Unanimous Consent! Marc Lee’s mother, Debbie Lee, lives in Surprise, Arizona, in our district, and he was the first Navy SEAL killed in Iraq while fighting to defend our nation. I hope this bill will quickly pass the Senate and get signed into law. It is an important bill that will pay tribute to the sacrifice Marc Lee made while serving our nation and will honor all of the brave men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our freedoms. 
Congressional Recognition
Gisele from our office presented a Congressional Recognition to Rayma Scalzo, the founder of the PebbleCreek Kare Bears, and Tom Meeks, the president. Founded 25 years ago, Kare Bears is a non-profit in Goodyear that focuses on neighbors helping neighbors in the PebbleCreek retirement community! Kare Bears also has volunteers who drive members of the community to non-emergency medical and therapy appointments, and assist those recovering from surgeries or hospitalizations. It is great to see people serving others in our local community. 

  
Encouraging Story
I loved seeing this story about how the West Valley Mavericks Foundation hosted a Turkeys for Teachers event that provided 930 turkeys and side dishes to teachers in the West Valley. They also partnered with the Goodyear Police Department to direct traffic, and teachers were treated to coffee and breakfast during the event! Education is so important to our nation’s children, and it was great to see the way our local community came together to support our teachers! 

Casework Highlight
A constituent contacted our office because she received an overpayment from the Social Security Administration, and her entire Social Security check was being withheld. Our office reached out to Social Security and requested a review of her account to verify if her claim was valid. Social Security responded and confirmed that they miscalculated her overpayment. The overpayment was reduced, and the constituent received checks for the funds she was missing. 
Coronavirus Casework Highlight
A constituent contacted our office because the Department of Economic Security (DES) would not respond to his many requests for benefits for the two-and-a-half-month time frame that his company was closed due to COVID-19. Our office sent his information to our contacts at DES, and after several attempts, his benefits were released. 
Our Washington, D.C. Office Update

12/7/20 9:28,CARES Act Lending Facilities: Purpose Achieved,"CARES Act Lending Facilities: Purpose Achieved
In response to the unprecedented market turmoil caused by the COVID-19 pandemic earlier this year, Congress acted quickly and passed the CARES Act.
One measure in this huge piece of legislation authorized temporary emergency lending facilities to provide taxpayer-backed loans to pandemic-impacted businesses and state and local governments while also stabilizing private credit markets. Congressional intent and the CARES Act are clear: these facilities were to be temporary in nature, operations were meant to cease no later than the end of 2020, and any leftover funds (of which there are currently over $400 billion) were to be returned to the treasury.
These facilities have been remarkably successful in achieving the intended purpose of stabilizing credit markets and restoring the flow of private credit. In fact, it worked better than most of us thought possible.
I applaud Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin for closing these facilities by year-end, exactly as the law requires, and as Congress clearly intended, and thank Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for returning the unused CARES funds back to the treasury.

Update on COVID-19
In the past few weeks, Pennsylvania and the rest of the country have experienced a concerning jump in new COVID-19 cases. While the reports of vaccines being available soon are encouraging, the threat of this virus is still very real.
It remains important that people continue to follow CDC recommendations: adhere to social distancing guidelines, wash your hands often, and wear a mask if you are heading out. Remember: my mask protects you and your mask protects me.
According to the Pennsylvania Department of Health, across the state as of Friday, December 4, 2020:
	•	Over 15% of all hospital beds were available 
	•	 Over 15% of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds were available 
	•	Nearly 70% of ventilators were available 
As of that date, positive cases in Pennsylvania reached 398,600, roughly a 3% increase from the prior day, and more than 2,893,300 tests had come back negative. This means almost 88% of Pennsylvanians tested for COVID-19, had a result that came back negative.
For more detailed information about resources available to you, visit the COVID-19 resource page on my website.
Futher Information:
The Centers for Disease Control provides updates on the virus and safety information for the public and healthcare professionals here.
The Pennsylvania Department of Health provides information on the virus and safety precautions here.
I encourage all Pennsylvanians to take this situation very seriously and observe the recommendations developed by the CDC.

New Airport Security Technology
 

 
 

Last week, I visited Miami International Airport to check out the newest Credential Authentication Technology (CAT) being implemented by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to improve airport security, make the screening process more touchless, and enhance the overall passenger experience. CAT is now available and in-use at Miami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. 
 

We Must Maintain U.S.-Cuba Policy & Remain in Solidarity with the Cuban People
 

It was an honor to join the Inspire America Foundation, a bipartisan group of colleagues, and members of Cuba’s opposition in an event calling on the current Administration to maintain U.S.-Cuba policy. Over the past four years, our country made tremendous progress in cutting off revenue to the brutal, anti-American dictatorship in Cuba. Now, it’s crucial that we prevent the current administration from squandering this opportunity to remain in solidarity with the Cuban people and support them in their struggle for democracy.

It was great to meet with Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava to discuss shared priorities for the coming months to support our Miami-Dade constituents and advance local projects. I look forward to our collaboration.

The FDA has approved the first COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use. This vaccine is safe, effective and will help us defeat the virus. 

I am incredibly confident in this vaccine because I am participating in a Pfizer vaccine trial myself. 

This is historic news and this vaccine is the next step towards restoring our way of life. 

ELECTION INTEGRITY

This week I filed an amicus brief with the Supreme Court in support of the Texas v. Pennsylvania, et al. case.

The amicus brief signed by more than 100 Members of Congress was about protecting the Constitution and our elections. The Constitution is clear - only state legislatures can change how presidential electors are chosen. 

Unfortunately, the Supreme Court refused the case.

Whether you are a Democrat, Independent, or Republican, we should all agree that we need fair, honest, and transparent elections. I believe the Supreme Court needs to ensure the integrity of our elections. 

THIS WEEK ON BUDDY'S BRIEFING

Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) this week. The NDAA is the primary way Congress meets its most important constitutional obligations to provide for the common defense. The legislation is critical for the military installations in the First District of Georgia, as well as for our troops and their families. The NDAA includes an extremely well-deserved pay raise and provides COVID-19 protections.  

The legislation also includes an increase of seven C-130J aircraft for Air Guard procurement which is critical to replace the aging fleet at the 165th Airlift Wing in Savannah, funding for the development and procurement of Columbia-class submarines to replace the Ohio-class boats stationed at Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay, and keeps the A-10s like those stationed at Moody Air Force Base flying. 

We discuss the NDAA, federal funding legislation and progress on a COVID-19 relief bill in this episode of Buddy's Briefing.

A majority of the Members of the House of Representatives are fully vaccinated. The most successful and beneficial legislation is bipartisan in nature. To make that happen, we must be able to build and maintain relationships with those on both sides of the aisle. Continuing to keep Members isolated with remote hearings and proxy voting prevents those relationships from developing. Last week, I led a letter alongside Members of the GOP Doctors Caucus asking for the timeline of when COVID-19 restrictions will be removed from the House chamber.

Friends, 
On the House floor Tuesday, I honored our state’s retiring Senior Senator, Senator Pat Roberts, for his 40 years of public service to Kansas.   Senator Roberts and his wife, Franki, have been tremendous ambassadors for agriculture, Kansas and America. Thank you, Senator Roberts, for your decades of service to Kansas. May God bless you and your family.

 

Fighting For Election Integrity
Yesterday I joined Congressman Mike Johnson and 104 other House colleagues in filing an Amicus brief in the Texas Attorney General’s lawsuit currently before the U.S. Supreme Court. The lawsuit, which is joined by President Trump and 16 other Republican Attorneys Generals, including Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt, challenges the validity of the outcome of the Nov. 4 general elections in Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. All four states have certified the election results despite outstanding claims of fraud and corruption. 
By filing this Amicus, we are seeking to affirm for the Court our serious concerns with the integrity of our election system, and reaffirm our belief that the various allegations and irregularities in those states merits careful, timely review by the Supreme Court. 
The American people must have confidence in the outcome of this election, and we must continue doing all we can to ensure our elections are conducted according to the Constitution, free from corruption and outside manipulation.  

Kansas Farm Bureau Town Hall
It was a pleasure to end last week with the members and leaders of Kansas Farm Bureau as part of their 102nd Annual Meeting Legislative Town Hall. I have spent my four years in Congress representing the hard-working farmers and ranchers of Kansas and look forward to continuing my work on behalf of the entire industry.
Agriculture is responsible for 40 percent of our state’s economy so it is imperative that we continue to do all we can to support our family farms and ranches, open markets abroad, level the playing field for our products, and provide risk-management tools for our hard-working producers.
Over the last four years, I helped write a strong Farm Bill, renegotiated more than half of our agricultural trade deals and undid burdensome Obama-era regulations, like Waters of the U.S.
We expanded E-15 ethanol to year-around use, increased access to high speed broadband and made large capital infrastructure investments possible throughout rural Kansas.
Moving forward I see a lot of opportunity for new trade deals, expanding biofuels, growing the pet food industry, and strengthening our animal health and ag research corridor. There remains opportunities to work with the livestock industry to grow processing capacity in communities across Kansas, and we are making great strides in learning how the agriculture industry can be an active player in market-oriented carbon capture technology.
Finally, we must remain focused on growing our rural communities, improving access to rural broadband and maintaining quality, affordable access to healthcare.

Promises Made, Promises Delivered
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's panel of vaccine experts have officially endorsed Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine, recommending it for Emergency Use Authorization.
For the past several months, I have said we would have a vaccine by the holidays and have worked alongside the Administration, pharmaceutical companies and our healthcare providers to ensure the development of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine.
This week's approval is the final step leading to the manufacturing and distribution of millions of doses for those most in need, and begins what will be the end of this horrible virus.
This is truly incredible news for our country.

Closing the Digital Divide
This Administration has been dedicated to the continued investment in Rural America, and few things are more valuable to the long-term prosperity of our rural communities than access to high-speed broadband.
This week the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced more than $9 billion in funding to deliver broadband service to 5.2 million previously underserved homes and businesses through its Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Phase 1 auction.
Twelve Kansas broadband and telecommunications companies were awarded more than $62.1 million to provide service to nearly 47,000 homes over the next 10 years.
Nearly all new customers will receive broadband speeds of 100/20 Mbps, with an overwhelming majority (more than 85 percent) getting gigabit-speed broadband. That's huge.
Connecting our rural families, businesses and communities is instrumental to their long-term success, and I applaud the FCC for its continued commitment to the expansion of high-speed broadband.

Welcome Home
Today, more than 3,500 soldiers from the 2nd Armored Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division will return to Fort Riley from their deployment to the Republic of Korea - just in time to celebrate the holidays with family and friends.
For the past nine months, the ""Dagger"" brigade played a critical role in deterring regional threats and strengthening peace in the Asia-Pacific region by providing an armor capability on the Korean Peninsula.
It has been an honor and privilege to represent Fort Riley and the soldiers of the Big Red One. Thank you to the brave men and women of the ""Dagger"" brigade for everything you do to protect this great nation.

Fighting Malnutrition
This week, I spoke on the House Floor ahead of the passage of House Resolution 189, a critical resolution addressing the health and development of children around the world and the continued role the U.S. must continue to play in this critical effort. As a father, grandfather, physician and Representative of the largest agricultural producing district in the country, this issue hits home for me.
Each year, malnutrition accounts for nearly half of all deaths among children under the age of five. Nearly a quarter of the world’s children are stunted due to malnutrition, leading to long-term poor health and impaired brain development. For many around the world, food is medicine.
The USDA and USAID oversee America’s longstanding commitment to reducing hunger and improving global food security. The USDAID’s international feeding programs originated in Cheyenne County, Kan., when a group of farmers presented the idea of distributing food – not just funding – to countries to help their populations thrive.
Programs like the USAID's Food for Peace and USDA's McGovern-Dole Food for Education provide basic humanitarian aid to families, women, and children worldwide and help our farmers and ranchers reach more markets for the high-quality commodities they produce. The U.S. exports about $140 billion worth of agricultural products each year, thanks to the hard work of our farmers and their partnership with USDA, USAID, and others.
Not only are U.S. investments in nutrition efficient and effective, U.S. nutrition programs leverage other investments in foreign assistance, increasing the impact on improving health globally which can lead to countries lessening their dependence on foreign aid and thriving economically.
We must continue to lead on this important issue.

Passing WRDA
On Tuesday, the House approved final language for the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA), which authorizes Army Corps of Engineers projects related to water infrastructure.
The bill includes provisions for      harbor and inland waterway maintenance, flood prevention and mitigation efforts, and authorizes studies and reports from the Army Corps for future planning efforts.
The Big First district of Kansas is one of the largest agricultural producing districts in the country, and well-maintained ports and waterways are critical to quickly and efficiently getting those goods and products to market.
This important bipartisan legislation guarantees that our ports and waterways are operational, providing certainty to producers in Kansas and across the country that they can get their products to consumers around the world.
It also authorizes the Army Corps of Engineers to conduct necessary flood prevention and mitigation efforts to protect our communities, homes, and businesses from future disasters. I applaud passage of this vital, bipartisan bill.

Reducing Maternal Deaths
As a practicing obstetrician for almost three decades, I know first-hand that childbirth is one of the most joyous occasions in life. But it also poses real medical risks. More than 700 mothers die each year in the United States — about one every 12 hours — as a result of pregnancy-related complications, which is far too many in a country with the most advanced medical care in the world.
This week, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released an important action plan to reduce maternal deaths and disparities that put women at risk prior to, during, and following pregnancy. The U.S. Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams issued a complementary Call to Action to Improve Maternal Health, outlining the critical roles everyone can play to improve maternal health. I applaud HHS and the Surgeon General for their attention to this important issue.
Since coming to Congress, I have worked to pass meaningful legislation that improves health outcomes for new moms. I was an early co-sponsor and vocal advocate of the Preventing Maternal Deaths Act of 2018, which spurred the creation of the Kansas Maternal Mortality Review Committee.
I have also supported legislation for payment models that incentivize health care providers to work together for continuous, holistic care for new and expecting mothers, and I support robust funding programs that benefit pregnant mothers, including Title V Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant, Healthy Start, and WIC.
And in Northwest Kansas, I have been an active supporter of the Northwest Kansas Maternal Health Network, which will help bridge gaps in maternal care for mothers who live in rural communities without obstetric care.

America The Beautiful
Laina and I recently had the opportunity to tour the White House Christmas decorations. This year's theme is ""America the Beautiful"" and is a tribute to the beauty and majesty of our great nation.
As always, First Lady Melania Trump did a spectacular job curating the decorations and honoring our nation's storied past while saluting today's heroes.

4/1/21 10:04,March Update from Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester,"Dear friend,
 
March was a busy month in Washington. We passed major legislation that will affect all Delawareans, including another COVID relief bill and common-sense gun safety bills. March was Women's History Month and we voted to remove the arbitrary deadline for ratifying the Equal Rights Amendment. I’ve also been busy meeting with constituents and Delaware stakeholders. 
 
My proudest moment in March was joining my colleagues in passing President Biden's American Rescue Plan. The bill included new direct payments and funding for expanding vaccine access which will move us toward a healthier country, a stronger economy, and help get children back in schools. Help is on the way. I am working in Washington to help recover, rebuild, and restore as a nation. 
 
Below, you will find a number of resources for COVID-19 testing, vaccines, and mental health. Please continue to contact my office with any issues you may have with federal agencies. You can reach my Wilmington office at (302) 830-2330, my DC office at (202) 225-4165, or my Georgetown office at (302) 858-4773.

Last Month in Washington
 
  
Passing the American Rescue Plan
 
I was proud to vote to pass H.R. 1319, the American Rescue Plan. This historic legislation was signed by President Biden, providing immediate and needed relief to the American people. The American Rescue Plan is landmark, life-saving legislation that will provide resources to defeat the virus, get vaccines in people’s arms, put money into families’ pockets, return children safely to the classroom, and put Americans back to work.
 
It provided economic relief to families through direct stimulus payments to 158.5 million households, which I was proud to champion. It also dramatically expanded the Child Tax Credit, putting money back in the pockets of families, secured critical resources to help us reopen schools and businesses, and bolstered our efforts to efficiently distribute vaccines as the Biden-Harris Administration continues their work to increase our supply. This is truly groundbreaking legislation and I believe it will help our nation to move from recovery to rebuilding.
 
For more details, read my press release here. 
  

  
Disinformation on Social Media
 
We are living in a time when disinformation on social media is extremely dangerous. On March 25, as a Member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I questioned tech CEOs, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Jack Dorsey of Twitter, and Sundar Pichai of Google. My questions focused on consumer protection and data privacy, including dark patterns which are user interface design choices that benefit an online service by coercing, steering, or deceiving users. These patterns have led to alarming outcomes that cause real damage and that's why I’m again partnering with Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) to introduce the DETOUR Act to protect against these manipulative practices.

March is Women's History Month
 
March is Women's History Month and my colleagues and I celebrated by passing H.J.Res 17, led by Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA), which would remove the arbitrary deadline for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the United States Constitution. The Equal Rights Amendment simply states: “Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or any State on account of sex.” It would finally affirm and enshrine the principle of women’s equality in our Constitution and explicitly prohibit discrimination based on sex in the nation’s foundational document. Last year, I was honored to preside over the House of Representatives during the historic vote on the ERA. I was proud to once again vote to remove the arbitrary deadline associated with the ERA. This vote was about a simple proposition - that all individuals, no matter their sex, are equal under the law. The House of Representatives made clear that equality has no deadline.

Creating a Cleaner Future
 
It is our responsibility to love this planet and to leave a clean environment for future generations. To work toward this goal, my colleagues and I introduced the CLEAN Future Act of 2021. This legislation creates a roadmap for the United States to aggressively tackle the climate crisis and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I am proud to join with my colleagues on the Energy & Commerce Committee in introducing the CLEAN Future Act and pleased that I was able to secure five key provisions that would benefit Delaware. From investing in our state energy programs to reducing carbon emissions at our nation’s ports, to monitoring and improving air quality across the country - the CLEAN Future Act will help us combat climate change and build a better and brighter future.
 
To read more about my provisions, you can read my press release here.
 
  

  
Combatting Gun Violence
 
Too many Americans are affected by gun violence every day. In March, we took action. The House passed H.R. 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021. Current federal law requires that licensed gun dealers conduct background checks on prospective purchasers before selling them firearms. However, this requirement does not apply to unlicensed sellers of guns, who frequently sell them without background checks in many different circumstances, such as on the internet, at gun shows, and through unregulated person-to-person sales. This bill would address this problem by requiring a background check on every gun sale or transfer with limited exceptions, such as gifts to family members and transfers for hunting, target shooting, and self-defense. 
 
My colleagues and I also passed H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2021. Currently, when an individual attempts to purchase a firearm from a licensed dealer, the FBI has three days to complete a background check. If the background check is not completed within three days, the firearm sale may proceed without a completed check. Known as the “Charleston Loophole,” this provision allowed a gunman to purchase the firearm used to murder nine parishioners at Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, South Carolina in 2015. This bill would close the Charleston Loophole by allowing the FBI more time to complete background checks and make sure that we keep guns out of the wrong hands. 
  

  
 
Last Month in Delaware 
 
  
Staying connected to Delawareans is critical, even as we have to remain physically distant. In March, I was pleased to join Delaware's PTA to discuss our students and what I can do in Congress to help. I am proud to say that in President Biden's American Rescue Plan, we secured funding specifically to get students back in schools by providing supports -- including resources to make our classrooms safer. I was also proud to join TeenSHARP and their brilliant students for a discussion on finding your purpose and Delaware State University Dreamers about legislation. Throughout March and February, I also had the pleasure of virtually meeting with various groups of Delawareans, including La Esperanza, the Islamic Society of Delaware, the Delaware Asian American Business Association, and the Delaware African Caribbean Coalition. I also met with the Coalition for the Delaware River Watershed, the Delaware Nature Society, and held a roundtable discussion on issues facing Women Veterans. Our session was inspired by and in honor of the late Adjutant General Carol Timmons.

Resources for Delawareans
 
COVID-19 Vaccine
 
Having a vaccine for COVID-19 is finally providing a light at the end of the tunnel for so many of us. You can visit coronavirus.delaware.gov/vaccine to learn about the process and find out which groups are eligible for the vaccine. Governor Carney recently announced that on April 6, all Delawareans aged 16 or older will become eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine at pharmacies, community vaccination sites, and mass vaccination events hosted by the State of Delaware. You can read more about the recent announcement here. When it is your turn, please be sure to get your vaccine.
 
My team and I have been working hard to bring more vaccine supply to Delaware. I fought to ensure that more funding was included for vaccines in the American Rescue Plan and specifically funding for small states such as ours.
 
At the beginning of his term, President Biden set a goal to get 100 million vaccines administered. We achieved that goal 40 days ahead of schedule. As I said, help is here and more vaccines are going in arms every day.
  
Vaccine Update for Veterans
 
The Wilmington VA Medical Center announced that all Veterans, regardless of whether they are enrolled in VA healthcare, as well as their spouses and caregivers, are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccines are being offered to Veterans at the Wilmington VA Medical Center or one of their five Community Based Outpatient Clinics in Delaware or southern New Jersey. Veterans can call 302-633-5200 (Monday - Friday, from 8 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.) for more information or to schedule an appointment. You can also visit the Wilmington VAMC website for more information and to see the most recent Veteran vaccination numbers.
  
Help is Here for Small Businesses
 
Small businesses were some of the hardest hit by the pandemic. In the American Rescue Plan, we made sure to include more funding for the PPP, EIDL loans, and other programs specifically for small businesses. Yesterday, with Senators Tom Carper and Chris Coons (both D-DE), we held a virtual roundtable with the Small Business Administration and small business owners in Delaware to share some of their new options with them. You can access small business relief options from the SBA here.
  

  
The Delaware Delegation hosts a Small Business Roundtable.
  
Get Tested
 
Even as the vaccine reaches more and more people every day, it is still critical that we stay vigilant against COVID-19. Testing is widely available in Delaware. There are a number of permanent and pop-up testing locations throughout the state. For the full list of testing locations, please go here.
  
Mental Health Resources
 
As we live through the collective trauma of the pandemic, I wanted to be sure you have access to important mental health resources (see below) that I hope will be helpful to you. For more information, you also can visit HelpIsHereDE.com or the Delaware Department of Services for Children, Youth and their Families’ Website.
  

  
Serving You
 
The COVID-19 public health crisis has left no community, family, or business untouched. In light of that, our casework team is on hand to assist with problems you may have with federal and government agencies. During the last term, my casework team recouped hundreds of thousands of dollars for Delawareans via back payments, refunds, or over-payments from the IRS, Social Security, or Medicare/Medicaid, and we look forward to continuing to help more Delawareans in the 117th Congress.
 
My team can assist with:
	•	Unemployment
	•	Social Security Administration
	•	Veterans Affairs benefits and services
	•	Passport and visa processing
	•	Citizenship and naturalization assistance

1/22/21 16:48,Senator Murphy COVID-19 Weekly Update: January 22nd,"Friend – 
Below please find the Murphy office update on COVID-19. 
As always, if you need assistance, please don’t hesitate to contact our Hartford or Washington, D.C. offices. 
Here’s what you need to know this week: 
	•	On Tuesday, Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States. Throughout the week, the president signed dozens of executive actions to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Senator Murphy released the following statement applauding the president’s actions.
	•	On Thursday, President Biden issued an Executive Order invoking the Defense Production Act to federalize the medical supply chain and ramp up production of the COVID-19 vaccine and PPE. Murphy has been calling on the president to federalize the medical supply chain since the beginning of the pandemic. He introduced legislation to force the president to fully invoke the Defense Production Act in March of 2020
	•	Today, Senator Murphy held a Facebook live with constituents to talk about his legislative priorities in the 117th Murphy provided a rundown of where things stand with Biden’s Cabinet nominees, COVID-relief, and impeachment.
	•	Senator Murphy joined Republican Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina to announce the introduction of their bipartisan FEED Act, legislation supported by Chef José Andrés and World Central Kitchen. The FEMA Empowering Essential Deliveries (FEED) Act allows the Federal government to pay 100 percent of the cost to states and localities so that they can partner with restaurants and nonprofits to prepare nutritious meals for vulnerable populations, such as seniors and low-income children. These partnerships will support businesses and small farmers as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.
	•	This week, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced state guidance for implementation of a requirement that state Medicaid programs suspend rather than terminate benefits for eligible incarcerated youth. Senator Murphy sponsored the original legislation requiring this change that was passed through the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act to help formerly incarcerated individuals access primary care and behavioral health services.
	•	This week, Governor Ned Lamont directed the Connecticut Department of Public Health to continue vaccinations for the 1.4 million individuals included in Phase 1b of Connecticut’s COVID-19 vaccine rollout using a tiered approach based on risk of adverse health outcomes from the virus. The State anticipates receiving about 45,000 doses of vaccine per week from the federal government.
	•	Connecticut Department of Social Services announced this week that food benefits will increase by 15% for all Connecticut households enrolled in SNAP. Approximately 110,000 enrollees will receive monthly COVID-19 emergency benefits starting on Saturday.

2/27/21 10:10,RURAL Act,"News from Representative Crawford 
 
                  

RURAL Act
This week, Congressman Tom Cole and I sent a letter to President Biden requesting that households, utility companies, small businesses, and agriculture producers adversely affected by the extreme winter weather receive priority for future COVID-19 relief funding. Millions of households spent days without any means by which to heat their homes, prepare and preserve food, and some even lost access to water. We believe it is necessary to send targeted resources to the people most afflicted by the pandemic along with families experiencing more distress due to this unprecedented weather event. We urge President Biden to immediately prioritize any Congressionally authorized direct assistance to our constituents who are suffering grave loss and will continue to experience hardship as they recover from this traumatic event. You can read the letter here.
In addition to the letter, I introduced H.R. 1291, the Reinforcing Utility Restoration After Losses (RURAL) Act. This legislation gives the Department of Agriculture authority to establish a bridge loan program for rural utility companies experiencing losses in the wake of federally-declared emergencies. Companies would have access to a line of credit for low-interest loans to cover qualified losses, with partial loan forgiveness available in certain circumstances. The RURAL Act will provide a lifeline to rural utilities experiencing financial losses due to emergencies and ensure they are not forced to stop critical services in rural America.
Rural areas already experience unique daily challenges and fewer resources. With the recent extreme temperatures and increase in power outages due to unprecedented demand, we witnessed the devastation that occurs when communities cannot access critical utility services. We must assist utility providers as they work tirelessly to maintain continuity for their customers. The RURAL Act ensures that rural Americans are not without vital resources and rural service providers are bolstered during a federal emergency.

Why 28 Republicans Are Calling for an Investigation Into the National Institutes of Health
Twenty-eight Republicans on Tuesday sent a letter to Health and Human Services' (HHS) Principal Deputy Inspector General Christi Grimm asking for an investigation into the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) relationship with the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV).
According to the legislators, there is sufficient evidence calling for an independent investigation into whether or not COVID-19 was the result of a lab leak at the WIV. The members of Congress have concerns about taxpayer funds partially funding the WIV's research.

4/10/21 19:39,"Weekly Wrap-Up: vaccines, local $, healthcare","Dear Lindsey,

During this week's district work period, I was able to meet with local city and county leaders about American Rescue Plan funding and celebrate the Seventh District's progress on the vaccine front. I also helped lead the introduction of two pieces of legislation, one of which is particularly near and dear to many in our community. Please keep reading for a brief recap of my week. As always, thank you for allowing me to serve the Seventh District.

WHAT I'M WORKING ON

Saturday afternoon, the Richmond and Henrico County Health Districts celebrated the 100,000th vaccine dose administered at the Richmond Raceway! I am so thankful to all the healthcare professionals and volunteers who worked to reach this milestone and continue to help vaccinate our communities across the Seventh District. Getting vaccinated is the number one thing all of us can do to make sure we're protecting ourselves, our families, and our communities in Central Virginia.




On Monday, I reintroduced the Michael Lecik Military Firefighters Protection Act in the name of Mike Lecik, a brave and kind hero who our Seventh District community tragically lost recently. Following a cancer diagnosis related to his service as a military firefighter and the VA denying his health coverage, Mike fought to make sure that thousands of his fellow military firefighters will be able to receive the proper care they earned in service to our country. While these servicemen and women are exposed to unique dangers through their work that lead many to develop service-related illnesses, the VA doesn't currently recognize this connection beyond one year following active duty. Mike and I worked on this bill together to right this wrong, and it was my privilege to reintroduce it this past week in his honor. READ MORE 

Tuesday afternoon, my staff and I met with more than 30 local mayors, city managers, Board of Supervisors members, town council members, sheriffs, school board members, and more municipal and county officials to discuss the potential uses of American Rescue Plan funds for local governments and schools. We were able to share information about its potential to make a real difference in getting our economies reopened safely, as well as answer specific questions from these leaders. We are all working together to make the best use of these funds for our communities. READ MORE FROM THE RICHMOND TIMES-DISPATCH 


This week, I helped lead the House introduction of bicameral legislation to establish a Civilian Climate Corps. The urgency of the climate crisis requires a new level of creativity and ambition. We must invest in opportunities for Americans to gain the necessary skills to build a stronger, healthier planet. Creating a talented pool of Americans with valuable expertise to lead this fight would not only benefit our planet, but also create additional jobs for American workers and reduce the long-term economic costs of this ecological crisis.

PHASE 2 VACCINE APPOINTMENTS

Beginning today, the Richmond and Henrico Health Districts, Chesterfield Health District, and Chickahominy Health District are scheduling vaccination appointments for pre-registered, Phase 2 eligible Central Virginians. Be sure to check your email and answer your phone! If you have yet to be vaccinated, make sure that you pre-register for an appointment at vaccinate.virginia.gov or by calling (877) 829-4682. READ MORE 
Pre-register for a COVID-19 vaccine

SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD UPDATES

In fewer than two months, since the start of the special enrollment period at healthcare.gov, nearly 15,000 Virginians have signed up for health insurance coverage! Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, Virginians can save on marketplace health insurance premiums. According to HHS, four out of five current healthcare.gov consumers will be able to find a plan for $10 or less per month after advance payments on tax credits. This is a fantastic opportunity to get the coverage you and your family need.

IN OUR DISTRICT

This week, my constituent services team surpassed $5 MILLION returned to Central Virginians. Reaching this major milestone in the just over two years since we began working on behalf of Seventh District constituents is the result of my dedicated staff putting in the time and energy to be accessible to those we serve. If you're having issues with a federal agency, program, or benefit, fill out this form on my website. If you have additional questions about how my office can help you, please call us at (804) 401-4110.

Since taking office in January 2019, my team has closed 1,950 cases and returned $5,005,265 to constituents.
Need help with a federal agency?

I encourage you to reach out if you believe we can be of service. Regardless of whether we agree on every political issue or not, my team is always happy to help.

Sincerely,
Abigail

Dear Friend,    As I have done throughout the pandemic, I want to provide you with the latest and best information from our nation’s leading experts.  Given my work as the Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, and Food and Drug Administration (FDA), I recently took the opportunity to converse with FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn on the development of COVID vaccines and continued testing.     Dr. Hahn and I spoke about the rigorous review process the FDA undertakes to ascertain the safety and efficacy of vaccines, and how he anticipates this process playing out over the coming weeks.  As Dr. Hahn noted, the typical schedule will be compressed, but there will be no “cutting corners” in ensuring that vaccines are safe and meet the FDA’s highest quality standards.     Dr. Hahn encouraged you to join the public FDA Advisory Committee meeting on December 10 to gain an in-depth understanding of the FDA’s processes before releasing vaccines for general use.  I will be sharing a link to that meeting on my social media pages.    For now, I invite you to review our enlightening and optimistic discussion about our fight against coronavirus.    


 Sincerely,   Congressman Jeff Fortenberry 

P.S. If you would like to send my office an email reply, please visit my website, Fortenberry.house.gov, or communicate with me on my Facebook and Twitter pages.

McKinley Advocates for Carbon Capture Innovation and American Energy Workers 
 
In an Environment and Climate Change Subcommittee hearing with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Michael Regan, Subcommittee on the Environment and Climate Change Republican advocated for the need to both unleash innovation in carbon capture technology and protect pipeline workers in America. 
 
Excerpts and highlights from his prepared remarks:
 
 
ON NEW SOURCE REVIEW PERMITS
 
“I think one thing we can all agree to is the world needs to reduce its carbon emissions and I think we are on the same page here.
 
“But the President has repeatedly pledged publicly to decarbonize the power sector by 2035 and some in Congress are trying to move that up to 2030.
 
“But what I want in this hearing today over this budget, I want to look at what will need to happen for a power plant to meet that goal. Carbon capture technology must become commercially viable, the New Source Review program must be reformed, and the U.S. will need to develop a pipeline system to dispose of the captured carbon.
 
“Utility companies have found that it takes seven to eight years to get a New Source Review permit, and then perform the engineering, design, permitting, and installation of carbon capture on a unit to achieve net zero.
 
“If utilities must comply with the Democrats’ 2030 goal, they will have to start this immediately using today’s technology. But it’s widely recognized that today’s carbon capture technology is not ready for prime time. It’s incapable of capturing 80% of our carbon emissions.
 
“But let’s assume that the technology works in the next 12 months and can capture 80% of the carbon emitted, utilities will still need a New Source Review permit to upgrade their units. Yet the New Source Review program lacks certainty and predictability.
 
“According to the GAO, EPA reviewed 831 units and 467 were found to have violated the New Source Review program after the upgrades had been made. That’s not certainty, that’s insanity. This can cause hundreds of millions of dollars in additional costs as a result of the EPA not following its regulations.
 
“So what our utilities need is certainty. That is why New Source Review needs to be reformed. Yet there is nothing in the President’s agenda or in this budget discussing reforms to this program.
 
“Rather, it seems that this administration will have the same agenda as President Obama’s, which focuses on regulations.”

McKinley Fights to Save Seniors Billions in Drug Costs 
This week, Rep. McKinley reintroduced the Ensuring Access to Lower-Cost Medicines for Seniors Act, aimed at ensuring Medicare beneficiaries receive the full benefit of affordable generic drugs.
 
In 2018 alone, generics and biosimilars saved Medicare beneficiaries over $90 billion. However, these savings are at risk due to an increasing number of generic and biosimilar medicines being included in the same pricing tier as the more expensive “brand name” drugs.
 
The Ensuring Access to Lower-Cost Medicines for Seniors Act seeks to reverse the negative impact of these recent changes, which are unnecessarily increasing what Medicare patients pay out-of-pocket for generic drugs.
 
Seniors on fixed incomes are hit the hardest by skyrocketing drug prices. Our bill would ensure seniors can benefit from lower-cost generic medicine and limit the amount they have to pay out of pocket. This is a common-sense bill that will help seniors access the medicine they need at a reasonable price.
 
The Ensuring Access to Lower-Cost Medicines for Seniors Act would: 
	•	Ensure automatic coverage of lower-cost generic and biosimilar medications on plan formularies immediately after launch.
	•	Place generic drugs on “generic-only” formulary tiers so patients are not charged the higher brand rate.
	•	Create a dedicated specialty tier for specialty generics and biosimilars with significantly lower patient cost-sharing than the brand specialty tier.

West Virginia Strong - The Comeback Plan
 
In March, Governor Jim Justice announced loosened restrictions on businesses, social gatherings, and youth travel sports. The executive order:

COMMITTEE UPDATE
  
 
 
Week in Review
 
Cindy and I are thankful for the time we’ve had in the U.P. as we’ve met with constituents - both in person and virtually- to discuss needs and issues important to each of them. Meetings this week ranged from discussions with the EUP Economic Development, interviews across the District to provide legislative updates, and discussions with constituents needing assistance with federal agencies.
 
In case you missed it, this week I sent out a press release highlighting some recent legislation I’ve supported that was signed into law extending the Paycheck Protection Program and other important issues for small businesses. If you have any questions about this, please don't hesitate to reach out directly to my office. 
 
I look forward to seeing you all soon and hope all who observe Good Friday are comforted and encouraged during this Holy Week. 
 
Respectfully,
 
Jack Bergman

(Sunny 101.9) U.S. Congressman Jack Bergman Shares Legislative Update
 
Bergman spoke about several matters, including his co-sponsoring of the Toxic Exposures in the American Military Act, which will improve access to care and benefits for veterans who were exposed to toxic substances in the military.
 
Bergman also talked about recently joining the bipartisan For Country Caucus made up of military Veteran members working to create a Congress that is less polarized, more efficient, and is trusted by Americans.
 
He also outlined highlights of the Rural Broadband Window of Opportunity Act to level the playing field for broadband expansion in Northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula.

(WisPolitics) U.S. Reps. Tiffany, Bergman: Hopeful About Prospects For Improved Rail Service
 
Rep. Tom Tiffany (WI-07) and Rep. Jack Bergman (MI-01) today expressed appreciation for freight rail carrier Canadian National (CN) after the company announced a partnership with WATCO that the companies say will improve access to rail service in northern Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.
 
CN on Wednesday announced an agreement “for the sale of non-core lines and assets on the Soo subdivision (approximately 250 miles of track) that runs from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario to Oba, Ontario and approximately 650 miles of branch lines of Wisconsin Central Ltd. in Wisconsin and Michigan. This marks the successful conclusion of the sale process that CN announced and launched in July of 2020.”
 
“Economic prosperity for many industries, manufacturers, and working families in the Upper Peninsula is tied to rail connectivity,” said Bergman. “While I will continue to remain watchful, I’m optimistic that today’s announcement will safeguard future commerce and access across the U.P. and throughout the region.”

(Washington Examiner) America’s Coming Robot Navy: What Could Go Wrong?
 
The Navy's ambitious vision, a future force in which large numbers of robot ships and submarines augment and sometimes replace traditional crewed warships, is outlined in an ""Unmanned Campaign Framework"" report released last month.
 
So, when Navy leaders showed up at a March 18 hearing to promote the concept, they ran smack into a wall of suspicion from jaded lawmakers, especially those with long military experience.
 
""It looks like a 21st-century version of the mid-'90s when the Pentagon PowerPoint Rangers became a force and presentation management where they developed the slide where nobody could read, but it was really cool,"" Rep. Jack Bergman, a retired Marine Corps three-star general and a Republican from Michigan, said.

(River Bender) Bost Spearheads House Effort To Address Toxic Exposures
 
U.S. Representative Mike Bost (IL-12) recently introduced the Toxic Exposures in the American Military (TEAM) Act, which will improve access to care and benefits for veterans who were exposed to toxic substances in the military. 
 
The bill will allow them to enroll in the VA healthcare system, create a process for the VA to establish a presumption of service connection for benefits, and advance scientific research into the effects of toxic exposure.
 
The TEAM Act is co-sponsored by Rep. Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen (R-A.S.), Rep. Jack Bergman (R-MI), Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN), Rep. Troy Nehls (R-TX), Rep. Barry Moore (R-AL), Rep. Tracey Mann (R-KS), Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-MT), Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-IA), Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-NC), Rep. Gus Bilirakis (R-FL), and Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ). In addition, Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) has introduced it in the Senate.

(Newsmax) Marine Lt. General-Congressman to Newsmax: 'We Can't Afford Not To Try To Win Over Vietnam’
 
Forty-six years after Communist North Vietnam overran U.S.-backed South Vietnam, a Marine Lt. General now serving in the U.S. House of Representatives, told Newsmax it was crucial that the U.S. try to bring freedom and free markets to the nation known as the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.
 
""We cannot afford not to try to win over Vietnam,"" said Rep. Jack Bergman, R.-Mich., himself a retired U.S. Marine Corps Lt. General and one of two Vietnam veterans serving in the House (the other is Indiana’s Republican Rep. Jim Baird).
 
Bergman is the newly-elected chairman of the Guardian Fund, a political action committee that promotes and supports minorities and veterans running for Congress.

(Whistleblowers Blog) Biden Announces Nominee To Lead Widely Criticized VA Whistleblower Office
 
On March 26, President Biden announced his intention to nominate Maryanne Donaghy to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Office of Accountability and Whistleblower Protection (OAWP).
 
If confirmed by the Senate, Donaghy will be taking over an office widely criticized by VA whistleblowers, members of Congress, and third-party watchdog groups. The OAWP was established in 2017 in order to prevent retaliation against whistleblowers and to initiate disciplinary actions against officials who do retaliate.
 
At a hearing on the report, Representative Jack Bergman (R-MI), ranking member of the Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, made a statement relevant to Donaghy’s nomination. “It’s the commander’s responsibility to establish a command climate and also that command culture,” Bergman said. “When you’re a commander coming into a unit that’s already established, good or bad, you inherit what you inherit. It is what it is, and it’s not necessarily what you want it to be — yet.”

VA Vaccine Act Signed into Law
 
This week, the VA VACCINE Act was signed into law. Rep. Bergman was proud to be a cosponsor of this key bill, which will allow the VA to vaccinate Veterans not currently enrolled in VA health care, Veterans’ caregivers, and Veterans living overseas. We’re increasing vaccine availability every day, and this new law will make sure we’re prepared to vaccinate as many Veterans seeking the vaccine as possible.
 
Bergman Addresses Veterans with Toxic Exposure
 
The VA approach to care continues to insufficient for Veterans who were exposed to toxic substances while defending our Nation. For this reason, Rep. Bergman helped introduce H.R. 2127 the TEAM Act. 
 
This legislation would expand care and coverage for Veterans with toxic exposure, increase research, and ensure the VA responds appropriately to that research for the purposes of providing benefits and treating illness.
 
Additionally, Rep. Bergman once again joined his colleagues to introduce  H.R. 2268 And H.R. 2269. H.R. 2268, the Keeping our Promises Act, would extend presumption of agent orange service-connected illnesses to Parkinsonism, Bladder Cancer, Hypertension, Hypothyroidism, Prostate Cancer, AL amyloidosis, early-onset peripheral neuropathy, Ischemic heart disease and Stroke. H.R. 2269, would modify the presumption of service connection for Veterans exposed to herbicide agents while serving at military bases in Thailand.
 
For Country Caucus Urges President Biden to Support Global War on Terrorism Memorial
 
the For Country Caucus urged President Joseph Biden to support the creation of the Global War on Terrorism Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, DC. The letter calls on President Biden to formally support H.R. 1115, the Global War on Terrorism Memorial Location Act to honor and recognize the brave men and women who fought and made the ultimate sacrifice in the wars against terrorism since the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.
 
Since the start of the Global War on Terrorism in 2001, over 2.7 million Americans have served in the United States Armed Forces. More than 60,000 have been wounded, and over 7,000 service members have lost their lives in service to our country.
 
H.R. 1115 and S. 535 aim to authorize the establishment of a memorial for service members of the Global War on Terrorism on the National Mall. With broad bipartisan support in Congress, the legislation is also supported by a large and growing coalition of veteran service organizations including the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Wounded Warrior Project, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, Student Veterans of American, National Military Family Association, and Team Rubicon.

Finding solutions to combat addiction and improve mental health
 
  
Every one of us has seen how addiction is touching every corner of Southwest Washington. That's why I've helped cofound the Bipartisan Addiction and Mental Health Task Force in Congress, which recently held its first session to shine the light on how COVID has exacerbated substance use and mental health issues across America. 
 
Our goal is to listen and learn, and then use that data to shape policies to help folks break addiction and obtain treatment to improve mental health.

5/23/21 23:58,Weekly Wrap Up,"Dear Neighbor,
  
First, a reminder that tomorrow at 6pm, State Representative Jon Rosenthal and I will host a Community Conversation on The First 100 Days in Austin and in Washington.  It’s been a busy session both in Congress and in the Lege, and there will be much to discuss.  I hope you will join us and look forward to answering your questions!  
  

  
You can click here to RSVP.  We will provide the link for the town hall via email on Monday at 4:00pm, so be sure to RSVP by 3:00pm tomorrow.  
 
It was a busy week at home and in Washington, D.C., and I am glad to share some of the highlights.  
  

  
While I was in Washington this week, I visited Arlington National Cemetery with several colleagues to remember and honor our fellow Americans buried there for their service to our country.
  

  
And it was fitting to introduce this week the Care Access Resources (CARS) for Vets Act with my colleague Congressman Mark Takano, Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs.  In our community and communities across the country, cars are essential forms of transportation, but for disabled veterans, driving can present challenges.  The VA has a successful grant program that allows for a one-time payment for disabled veterans to adapt their cars to meet their specific needs, helping to ensure that they live independent and mobile lives.  Our legislation builds on the success of this program by making it possible for program participants to purchase additional vehicles to meet their needs every 10 years.
  

  
  
I was also glad to lead a letter with Representatives Judy Chu, Diana DeGette, and Barbara Lee to the Department of Health and Human Services on the Biden administration’s proposals to repair and rebuild the Title X family planning program.  Title X is the only federal program dedicated to family planning.  It was born in TX-07, introduced in Congress by President George H. W. Bush when he was the congressman for our district, and it provides critical preventive health care services for millions of low-income Americans each year.  
  

  
We passed several important bills this week.  We began the week voting to pass COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act with overwhelming support, and I was glad to see President Biden sign it into law this week.  The law will ensure better tracking and reporting of hate crimes against the AAPI community, which have increased since the beginning of the pandemic, as well as provide support for victims and guidance for state and local law enforcement agencies to report hate crimes. 
  

  
The House also passed bipartisan legislation to create an independent commission to investigate the January 6 attack on the Capitol.  As I have previously shared with you, I was in the chamber of the House of Representatives that day and witnessed the attack on our democracy—an attack we cannot forget and that we have a responsibility to ensure never happens again.  In order to do so, we need a comprehensive understanding of what happened, which is what the bipartisan, independent commission will work to do.  
  

  
The House also passed the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, bipartisan legislation I co-sponsored that will help secure strong and clear workplace protections for pregnant workers. 
  

  
In addition to these bills, the House passed the following bills with overwhelming bipartisan support:
	•	Homeless Veterans with Children Reintegration Act to help homeless veterans with children quickly access federal programs designed to help service members reenter the workforce.  These programs help teach homeless veterans the critical occupational skills necessary to find jobs, reach financial stability, and secure permanent housing.
	•	GI Bill National Emergency Extended Deadline Act to ensure that veterans don’t lose access to expiring GI bill educational benefits due to school or program closures related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The legislation would allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to pause the time limit currently placed on the use of GI Bill benefits and allow them to restart the clock after it is safe for veterans to return to school.
	•	Rural STEM Education Research Act, which directs the National Science Foundation to research ways to improve STEM education in rural areas.  This bill would also create regional partnerships between universities, local industries, and schools to provide Pre-K-through-12 students with more hands-on research experiences and encourage more rural students to enter into STEM-related fields. 
	•	STEM Opportunities Act to help keep America a global leader in science and technology innovation by identifying and lowering barriers facing underrepresented minorities in STEM educational programs and professions. 
	•	COVID-19 Fraud Prevention Act to create the Consumer and Investor Fraud Working Group that will provide resources, including information about legal aid, to help consumers respond to incidents and protect consumers from financial fraud during the pandemic. 
	•	Homebuyer Assistance Act to make it easier to purchase a home with a Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage by reducing the requirements appraisers have to meet before being allowed to perform appraisals on FHA financed homes.  This will help make homeownership a reality for first-time, low-income, and minority homebuyers, many of which utilize the FHA mortgage program. 
	•	TRANSPLANT Act to reauthorize the National Marrow Donor Program, a federal program that matches unrelated volunteer bone marrow donors and cord blood units with patients who have been diagnosed with leukemia or over 70 otherwise fatal blood disorders and diseases.  The bill will ensure that patients have access to life-saving transplants and treatments. 
As a reminder, you can view my full voting record on my website.
  

  
I was glad to join the Energy and Commerce’s Subcommittee on Energy for a hearing with the Secretary of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, where I had the opportunity to ask her about support for carbon capture technology.  And the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce also held a hearing on automotive technology— “Promises and Perils: The Potential of Automobile Technologies”—where we discussed the potential of automobile technologies to help keep us safer on the roads.  
  

  
After returning home from Washington, I had the pleasure of joining the Houston International Festival in celebrating the United Nations Association World Day for Cultural Diversity with leaders from our community and dignitaries from around the world at Houston City Hall.  
  

  

  
I was also happy to meet virtually with several groups, including Interfaith Ministries for Greater Houston to discuss their priorities and hear more about their work in our community, from Meals on Wheels, to volunteer opportunities, support for refugees, and more.
  

  
I also met with several constituents virtually on matters of health care policy, energy policy, and other current affairs, and I spoke with the Houston Association of Realtors as well as the International Association of Drilling Contractors.
  

  
I was glad to end the week at the University of Houston’s virtual conference on Policy Prescriptions for the Biden Administration as a panelist on the energy and environment panel.   
  

  
As you have likely seen in the news, the end of the week brought unwelcome news here in our district and across our community.  The Texas General Land Office (GLO) announced its initial distribution of the federal funds Congress provided after Hurricane Harvey for disaster mitigation projects.  The City of Houston and Harris County were not awarded any funds as part of the one-billion dollars in funds the GLO awarded.
 
This is outrageous and an affront to our community.  I have spoken with Mayor Turner, Judge Hidalgo, and many other community leaders and officials about this result, which raises serious questions about the GLO’s entire process.  Members of our Houston Congressional delegation sent a letter to the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Friday sharing our concerns and asking for assistance.  
 
In the last Congress, I worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to expedite the delivery of these funds, and I will continue to work with my colleagues and our community leaders to fight for Houston and Harris County to get our fair share of the funds.  You can read our letter to HUD here. 
  


  

  
On the other hand, we had good news this week in the fight against COVID-19.  Harris County reduced the COVID-19 threat level to Orange alert/Level 2.  Nearly a third of the population in Harris County is fully vaccinated, and Judge Hidalgo has said the decision to lower the threat level is a reflection of the success of the vaccine in lowering hospitalizations, death rates, daily cases and other key measurements.  
 
The COVID-19 threat level guidance applies mainly to those who are still unvaccinated, and recommends these people continue to minimize contact with others, avoid any medium or large gatherings, and visit businesses that follow public health guidance.
 
Anyone who is looking for a COVID-19 vaccine provider can click here to find a provider nearby.  COVID-19 vaccines are widely available across our community, and I encourage anyone who is eligible to get vaccinated.  The current positivity rate Harris County is at 7.6 percent.

I am proud to represent you, and I am here to help you.  Please do not hesitate to call me to share your thoughts and concerns or to let me know how my team and I can help.  You can email here, or call my office at (713) 353-8680 or (202) 225-2571 any time.  I look forward to hearing from you.
 
 
Best wishes,

Coronavirus Update

On Monday, Michigan reported 4,536 new cases of COVID-19 and 47 new deaths, bringing the state’s total cases to 523,618 and deaths to 13,401. Michigan’s chief doctor, Dr. Khaldun, is warning that we are at a pivotal moment in Michigan’s fight against the coronavirus. “The declines we were seeing prior to the holidays seem to be reversing,” she said. If you traveled during the holidays, it is important to get tested and follow CDC guidelines to prevent potential spread.
Vaccines are continuing to be delivered to states. On Monday, Michigan reported 829,200 COVID vaccines have been distributed and, of that, 233,085 vaccines have been administered. Michigan ranks 11th in the U.S. for the number of first doses that have been administered. To speed up vaccinations, on Friday, Gov. Whitmer announced that Michigan will expand vaccination eligibility to Michiganders 65 and older, frontline workers, and teachers and childcare providers.
President-elect Biden will hit the reset button on the Trump Administrations vaccine rollout plan, or lack thereof. Rather than holding back vaccines for second doses, the Biden Administration will move to make reserved vaccinations immediately available for more Americans to receive their first dose. Most health experts agree this is the right move to speed up vaccinations and bring this terrible time to a close.

House Plans Vote Demanding Pence Seize Trump’s Powers – New York Times
 
 Legislative Update



Last Wednesday, the symbol of Democracy in the U.S. was violently attacked as Members of Congress were meeting to perform our sacred duty of certifying the 2020 Presidential Election. The attack on the Capitol, incited by Donald Trump, was not an act of patriotism – it was an act of terrorism. Trump has shown time and time again that he is unhinged and unfit for office. The violence caused by his rhetoric demands immediate and aggressive action.
On Monday, House Democrats introduced a resolution calling upon Vice President Mike Pence to immediately invoke the powers of the 25th Amendment, to remove Donald Trump from office until the new administration is sworn in. Additionally, Democrats have also introduced an impeachment resolution, charging President Donald Trump with inciting a deadly insurrection attempt at the U.S. Capitol last Wednesday.
The House will vote on the 25th Amendment Resolution today and the impeachment resolution tomorrow.
With deep sadness for our country and the state of our democracy, I will be supporting these efforts to remove Trump from office and transfer the powers of the presidency to Vice President Pence until the new administration is sworn in. Trump poses a clear and present danger to our nation as he becomes more unhinged in the waning days of his administration. He must be removed from office and barred from ever holding public office again.

 COVID Vaccinations
 
Michigan is busy at work distributing and administering COVID vaccines. On Friday, the state expanded eligibility to receive the vaccine. More information on vaccinations can be found by visiting https://www.washtenaw.org/3269/COVID-19-Vaccination.

MI-12 COVID Testing Sites
The State of Michigan has launched a statewide COVID testing site locator. This tool will help Michiganders search for cost-free testing sites near them. If you or someone you know may have been exposed to COVID, it is important you get tested.  


Additional COVID testing sites are announced regularly and this list may not be exhaustive. 

ACCESS Community Health and Research Center (6450 Maple Street, Dearborn) offers free mobile COVID testing every Tuesday, from 1-5 p.m. Tests will be given on a first-come-first-serve basis, though you may pre-register by texting “UPG Cares” to 48355.

The 2|42 Community Church in Ann Arbor (648 S. Wagner Road, Ann Arbor) is offering contactless drive-thru only saliva testing. Testing is available at this site Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m., and on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3 to 7 p.m. Pre-registration is required for this testing site. Those needing to be tested should pre-register here: lynxdx.health/register
Be safe, Michigan! Wear your mask, keep your physical distance, and wash those hands!
Sincerely,

Debbie Dingell
Member of Congress

2/8/21 20:50,9 Things You Missed Last Week,"A message from US Senator Todd Young
 


Opposing Divisive Partisan Overreach on COVID-19 Relief
Last year, the Senate approved five COVID-19 relief packages in overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion. As we look at an additional round of relief, I have been outspoken on the need for it to be bipartisan as well. I have shown my willingness to do that last week as one of 10 Republican Senators who met with President Biden after proposing a more targeted COVID-19 relief package.  President Biden has emphasized his desire for unity, but actions from his Democratic counterparts in Congress aren’t matching up to his rhetoric. Their plan to ram a one-sided COVID-19 package through Congress without bipartisan negotiation is the exact opposite of unity. We should be working together to get vaccines in arms, provide small business relief, and get our kids back to school. But instead, national Democrats are prioritizing a partisan package that focuses more on liberal priorities that have nothing to do with the pandemic, such as bailing out fiscally irresponsible states and raising the minimum wage. I’m disappointed this is the approach Democrats in Congress have chosen to take.   Click here to watch my interview on Fox News discussing the matter.  
 
My Amendment to Prohibit Stimulus Checks for Illegal Immigrants  
Last Thursday, I introduced an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Resolution that would prohibit any future Economic Impact Payments (EIPs) or similar direct stimulus payments from being distributed to illegal immigrants, which is aligned with the same eligibility criteria for the first two rounds of EIPs.  Stimulus checks were intended to provide a lifeline to Americans struggling to make ends meet during the coronavirus pandemic. They were not intended for people who are in our country illegally. Our amendment would ensure that people who break our immigration laws aren’t receiving taxpayer-funded handouts.  It would establish a dangerous precedent if the federal government were to give a direct cash payment to those who have jumped the line and subverted our nation’s immigration system to enter the United States. I was pleased the Senate has passed our amendment on a bipartisan basis, but Senator Chuck Schumer ultimately stripped the provision from the bill in the middle of the night. I plan to continue to fight for these important taxpayer protections as the next COVID relief bill is debated.  It is important to note that this amendment would have no impact on EIP eligibility for mixed-status families, an issue that was remedied in a bipartisan fashion as part of the December COVID relief package.  Click here or on the image below to watch my floor speech.  
 
The REINS Act to Curb Costly Regulations  
We have made significant progress reining in costly, job-killing regulations since I first introduced the REINS Act in the House eight years ago, but as we enter a new administration, it is more important than ever that we pass this legislation. Congress must play a role in approving major federal rules and regulations to ensure Americans’ best interests are being considered by elected officials who can be held accountable, not just unelected bureaucrats in Washington.  The REINS Act would protect taxpayers by requiring that Congress affirmatively approve every new major rule proposed by the Executive Branch before it can be enforced.  
Call to Move the 2022 Olympic Games Out of Communist China 
Last week, I reintroduced a resolution calling on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to move the 2022 Winter Olympics out of Communist China and rebid it to another country unless Beijing immediately addresses its egregious and numerous violations of human rights. 

The Chinese Communist Party’s horrific record of human rights abuses should not be rewarded by allowing them to host the 2022 Olympic Winter Games. The Olympic Games are about coming together and showcasing the best athletes around the world. The Chinese Communist Party’s actions in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and elsewhere makes such unity impossible. The International Olympic Committee should abandon plans for the 2022 Games in China and seek out a new host country that respects the most basic human rights. 
Supporting our Child Care Workforce 
My Early Educators Apprenticeship Act supports the role of apprenticeships in improving child care affordability and provides professional development opportunities to potential child care workers, which is more important than ever as we continue to navigate the coronavirus pandemic. This bill is especially critical in rural areas, including many communities in Indiana, where finding affordable child care is particularly challenging in normal times, and even more dire during the current public health crisis. 
Tax Credit to Encourage Revitalization of Distressed Homes
Last week, I reintroduced a bipartisan bill to revitalize housing in distressed neighborhoods nationwide. The Neighborhood Homes Investment Act (NHIA) will help address the housing affordability crisis, create jobs, and encourage economic development during these tough times. By providing a tax credit to remove and redevelop abandoned buildings, we can incentivize more affordable housing to be constructed in areas that are in need of rehabilitation. This legislation will benefit many struggling communities in Indiana seeking to revitalize amid this pandemic.
Urging Biden Administration to Support Indiana Auto Manufacturing by Addressing Global Semiconductor Shortage 
In a bipartisan letter to Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese, I urged him to work with Congress in addressing the global semiconductor shortage facing auto manufacturing. According to the Indiana Economic Development Council, over 100,000 Hoosiers work in the automotive manufacturing industry, which has over 500 automotive companies located in Indiana alone. The automotive industry contributes well over $15 billion to Indiana’s economy. This shortage threatens our post-pandemic economic recovery, and the consequences stand to be especially acute in dominant auto manufacturing states like ours.  Click here to learn more.  
Protecting Journalists and Promoting Press Freedom Around The World 
Freedom of the press is essential to democracy, good governance, and holding those in power accountable. This principle was enshrined in our founding documents for that reason. Because our values do not stop at our border, I am proud of the bipartisan Global Press Freedom Act that will empower our diplomats to support a free press around the globe.
Paying Respects to Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick 
On Thursday, I paid my respects to U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick as he laid in honor in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. His bravery and sacrifice for our nation on January 6 will be remembered by all.

Concern Over Our Southern Border
As your representative in Congress, I am very concerned about the dramatic rise of illegal immigration along our southern border. According to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, we are now on track to reach the highest number of border apprehensions in the last 20 years.   In January, the U.S. Border Patrol reported approximately 5,600 encounters of unaccompanied children along the border. That number rose to 9,300 in February, and had surpassed 11,000 by March 21st. In fact, the Dept. of Homeland Security has issued orders mobilizing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to help with these unaccompanied minors.  I believe we now have a humanitarian crisis along our southern border caused, in part, by the current Administration's policies that:
	•	stop new construction of the border wall;
	•	suspend the removal of many people with active deportation orders,
	•	cancel our policy requiring asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while their claims are vetted by U.S. authorities.
I do not think amnesty, permanent residency, and/or a pathway to citizenship are rational solutions to our immigration problems. Instead, I will continue to work for common-sense immigration solutions that:
	1.	secure our border; while at the same time...
	2.	prevent asylum claims from being abused;
	3.	enable businesses to legally hire workers when they cannot find willing Americans; and
	4.	pressure Central and South American countries to get their house in order and take care of their own citizens.
 

Vaccines for Everyone Aged 16 & Older
As of March 31st, anyone in South Carolina aged 16 and older who wants a COVID vaccine is eligible to make an appointment. Vaccines are provided at no cost.  Please remember that SC DHEC has a website to help locate vaccine providers in our state. Additionally, it has established a care line to call for questions about the COVID-19 vaccines or to help find a provider. That phone number is toll free: (866) 365-8110.

What I've Been Working On
Since January, I've either sponsored or co-sponsored over 125 bills in the House of Representatives. There are two bills I'd like to highlight in this month's newsletter which focus on government accountability:

H.R. 1937 - ""COST Act""
 
A couple of weeks ago, I introduced new legislation that will help shed some more light on where your tax dollars are spent. It’s called the COST Act, which stands for “Cost Openness and Spending Transparency.” This bill will require better and more detailed public disclosures of how federal dollars are distributed. Click here or the button below to learn more.
Read More on H.R. 1957

H.R. 2199 - ""Federal Agency Sunset Commission Act""
 
As the federal government continues to grow, I believe there is currently no effective way to identify and deal with those agencies whose functions are either (A) no longer necessary, (B) duplicated elsewhere within the federal government, or (C) just inefficient and wasteful.  So last week, I co-sponsored a bill that will force an automatic – and recurring – review of every federal agency, department, and bureau. These reviews will help the federal government consolidate or eliminate (i.e. ""sunset"") functions that are no longer needed, which could save taxpayers billions of dollars in the long run. Click here or the link below to learn more.
Read More on H.R. 2199


2021 Congressional Art Competition
High School Students - the 2021 Congressional Art Competition is a nation-wide high school art contest sponsored by the members of the U.S. House of Representatives. This is an opportunity to recognize and encourage artistic talent right here in our congressional district!  If you're an interested high school student or know someone who is, the deadline to submit artwork is April 19th.

HAPPY HOLIDAYS!
This has been a tremendously hard year in our country and our community. Over 320,000 American lives have been lost to COVID-19, and we expect a dark winter still ahead. This holiday season has been unlike any other we’ve celebrated in America: empty seats at many dinner tables and the threat of the coronavirus hanging over normal holiday activities.
Too many hard-working people have lost their livelihoods this year through no fault of their own. Too many Ohioans are scared and unsure about their future as our country reckons with this deadly global pandemic. And that uncertainty is not unfounded. But with such big challenges that we face, I hope we can recognize glimmers of hope. The recent news of vaccines coming to our community is a huge, important step forward. I’ve said many times: you can’t have an economic recovery when thousands of Americans are dying every day from this virus. As more Americans get vaccinated and we can begin to safely reopen, I am confident better days are to come for us all.
Additionally, this week I voted to pass the latest COVID-19 stimulus deal that will deliver cash relief directly to working-class people, it will enhance unemployment benefits for those who have been laid off, and it will provide additional nutrition assistance to ensure folks aren’t going hungry over the holidays. This legislation certainly isn’t perfect in my eyes; I wish the cash payments were $2,000/month recurring, as outlined in my bill, the Emergency Money For the People Act, and I wish it provided state and local funding to ensure firefighters, police, teachers, and waste management teams keep their jobs regardless of state revenue shortfalls this year. But I truly believe the perfect cannot be the enemy of the good here. I’m happy my colleagues came to the table and we are able to get help out the door before year end.
In January, I believe Congress must get back to work immediately addressing the shortcomings of this stimulus deal. There are also many legislative priorities I have in mind for the coming year – I look forward to updating you in the coming weeks on my vision for 2021 in our district.
In the meantime, I am thinking of you all. I’m praying for you and for the future of our country.
Happy holidays! 

Tim 

Happy holidays, from my family to yours!

12/18/20 22:22,The Blackburn Report: Vaccine Progress in Tennessee,"THE BLACKBURN REPORT  December 18, 2020 
SENATE INSIDER  
VACCINE PROGRESS IN TENNESSEE 
Tennessee is a strong leader in the fight against COVID-19. This week in Lebanon, I joined Cold Chain Technology for the launch of their new manufacturing and distribution facility in our great state. With their help, Tennessee will lead the nation in distributing the COVID-19 vaccine. Already, the first doses of the Pfizer vaccine are being administered to frontline caregivers at hospitals across the state. In addition, the FedEx Memphis hub has been instrumental in distributing the vaccine.
 
 
 
CONTINUING TO SUPPORT OUR LIVE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY 
The live entertainment industry has been decimated by the pandemic at no fault of their own. They were amongst the first to be affected and they will be among the last to recover. In this time of fear and uncertainty, it is important that we do not abandon these creators who lift our spirits. For months now, I have been leading bipartisan efforts to support our entertainment industry. You can read more about my work here.   This week I also had Grammy award winning producer Joe West on ‘Unmuted with Marsha’ to talk about his lively career in music and how the pandemic has impacted our creative community in Tennessee
 
CHINESE ESPIONAGE THREATENS AMERICAN SECURITY 
We’ve all heard that Chinese agents promote propaganda through Confucius Institutes and sister city partnerships, but this week, reports revealed the depth of Chinese Communist Party’s spy operations. Chinese spies were identified as part of a decades-long operation to infiltrate the U.S. consulate in Shanghai. We must put an end to Chinese espionage and hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable.    
 
CONFIRMING JUDGES   The Senate has confirmed 233 Article III judges appointed under the leadership of President Trump. This includes three Supreme Court Justices, 54 circuit court judges, 173 district court judges, and three Court of International Trade judges. Recently, we confirmed two new district court judges for the Eastern District of Tennessee. Congratulations to Katherine Crytzer who will be serving in Knoxville and Chuck Atchley who will be serving in Chattanooga.  
  
MARSHA’S ROUNDUP 
I joined Shannon Bream to talk about the calls for a Special Counsel to investigate Hunter Biden and the treatment of conservative women by mainstream media. 
 
 
I spoke with Harris Faulkner about the Senate hearing on election security and the Hunter Biden probe.     
 
I joined Varney&Co to share my thoughts about the COVID-19 relief package and Hunter Biden’s ties to Communist China.  
 
 
I took to the Senate floor to discuss the pandemic’s impact on Tennesseeans.    
 
I discussed with Shannon Bream the ways China’s communist government threatens our national security.

A NEW ADMINISTRATION AND A NEW DAY
Dear friend,
Yesterday, we welcomed a new administration and light and hope for our future. As President Biden and Vice President Harris step into their new roles, I am reminded of the words of late President George H. W. Bush to incoming President Bill Clinton: Your success now is our country's success. 
At a time of great pain and loss, I am confident that this new administration will tackle these challenges with facts, experience, and integrity; build us back better than before; and renew the American dream that so many have been shut out of for decades.  
  
The Biden administration has already outlined a clear and comprehensive plan to address the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis. The American Rescue Plan sets forth a national vaccination program, delivers relief to families and our economy, and supports our local essential workers through policies I’ve been calling for throughout the pandemic: 
	•	To address the alarming rise in childhood poverty and support families, the Biden-Harris administration adopted a policy I’ve championed to provide families with up to $3,000 per child and $3,600 for children under 6 through an expansion of the Child Tax Credit. This expansion would also make the credit fully refundable so families who previously earned too little to receive the credit will now have access to the full benefit.  
	•	The Biden-Harris administration is also prioritizing resources for local, state, and tribal governments so they can continue responding to the public health crisis, ramp up vaccinations, and pay essential workers like first responders, teachers, and public health workers.
As the Chair of the New Democrat Coalition, I am ready to partner with this administration to move our country forward. It’s time to get to work.
As always, I am here to help you. If you need assistance at this difficult time, please do not hesitate to contact my Kirkland office at (425) 485-0085. For more updates on what I’m doing for WA-01, you can follow me on social media at the links above.
Stay safe and stay healthy,
Suzan

12/20/20 11:17,Honoring Chuck Yeager,"Dear Friend, 

I hope you are having a good Holiday season. 

The COVID-19 vaccine arrived in West Virginia this week! We have turned a big corner in the fight against this virus. I thank the West Virginia National Guard and all health care officials who are working vigorously to distribute this vaccine to those who need it. If have questions about the vaccine and how to get it, learn more here. 

Recently we said goodbye to West Virginia native and the first pilot to break the sound barrier, Chuck Yeager. He was a war hero, an incredible pilot, and a great West Virginian. He will always be remembered. I spoke about his life and legacy on the House Floor. You can watch my full speech below. 

 

I also spoke in the Committee on Oversight and Reform about how the tragic opioid epidemic has hit Appalachia. In the hearing, we held Perdue Pharma and the Sackler Family responsible for recklessly marketing and incentivizing doctors to prescribe OxyContin to patients, resulting in their addiction to the drug. Since coming to Congress, I have made addressing the opioid epidemic a priority. I have supported our Administration's work to increase access to naloxone and provided much needed federal dollars to our treatment centers to get members of our community the help they desperately need. I have also supported creative community-based solutions that are a result of our local communities coming together and helping our neighbors in need. While we have made great strides to address this terrible epidemic, we must also ensure we address the actions taken by Purdue Pharma in pushing OxyContin to patients.

Reacting to President Biden's Joint Session speech

On the campaign trail and in his inaugural address, President Biden routinely indicated that unity would be the guiding principle of his administration. Yet by his actions, he has deliberately played the American people. Since taking office, he has governed as the most partisan president in modern history.
Biden has killed thousands of jobs and made our country more dependent on foreign oil by nixing the Keystone XL pipeline and reentering the Paris Climate Agreement. The Biden-Harris Administration has created a humanitarian crisis at our southern border by abolishing the successful ‘Remain in Mexico’ policy. Their actions have sent COVID positive immigrants into the heart of the nation and allowed drug cartels free reign of the border leading to increased drug and human trafficking. He and Vice President Harris have endangered American lives by their reckless actions.
Then, under the pretense of COVID-19 relief, when only 9% of that legislation actually was related to COVID-19, he has rammed through trillions of dollars of liberal wish list items that our nation simply cannot afford. He and Speaker Pelosi have essentially ruled by decree rather than by bipartisan efforts. These are not the actions of a political moderate.
He also made a pitch for his $2.5 trillion so-called infrastructure plan and his $1.8 trillion so-called family plan. These initiatives, just like his so-called COVID-19 legislation, would rob the hard-earned dollars of future generations to fund programs that only his most radical supporters are calling for him to pass.
If these were signed into law, the running total of money he has spent since taking office would shoot up to $6.1 trillion – a staggering and reckless amount of money that would transform our country in the mold of California socialism and place us well on the way to being like a bankrupt Venezuela. I pray that the American people see through this charade and rebuke him for his wanton disregard of financial accountability.

My fellow physicians and I urging others to take the COVID-19 vaccine

The faster we all get vaccinated, the faster we all can return to normal. Please take a few minutes to watch the video above where several of my fellow physicians and I detail why it's so important for us to get the COVID-19 vaccine.

Opposing D.C. Statehood

On April 22nd, House Democrats passed a bill that would make Washington, D.C. the 51st state. I voted against it.
Democrats are hellbent on destroying every American institution that stands between them and total control of government. Whether you look to H.R. 1, their efforts to eliminate the legislative filibuster, or their desire to pack the Supreme Court, radical progressives from the left are willing to do whatever it takes to ensure they can control every aspect of our lives.
Their latest scheme to make Washington, D.C. a state is a poorly disguised attempt to give Democrats two more Senate seats. If Democrats’ real motive is to provide congressional representation to the citizens of Washington, D.C., then they would be open to the many other constitutional alternatives other than D.C. statehood, such as following precedent and retroceding D.C. back to Maryland as Congress did with Virginia in 1846.
In addition, making D.C. a state would require us to repeal the 23rd Amendment, which allots three electoral college votes to D.C. If we didn’t do this, the presidential family would be the only residents of the federal district and they would have three electoral college votes just for themselves. That would be absolutely outrageous. I am greatly discouraged by this bill’s passage. Instead of doing real work for the American people, Speaker Pelosi has us doing this nonsense. 

Introducing the Abortion Providers Loan Elimination Act

Earlier this week, I joined Senator Roger Marshall, M.D. to introduce the Abortion Providers Loan Elimination (APLE) Act, which requires Planned Parenthood affiliates to return the $80 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans they illegally applied for and received. It would also ensure Planned Parenthood affiliates, and other abortion providers, remain ineligible for future PPP funding and instruct the Small Business Administration (SBA) Inspector General to investigate how this national organization was able to receive funds from the program.
In May of 2020, SBA notified 39 Planned Parenthood affiliates that they had wrongfully applied for PPP loans totaling more than $80 million. SBA determined that these affiliates were ineligible for the loans under the applicable affiliation rules, and that the loans they received should be returned. According to the most recently available data, 7 affiliates did so, but the remaining 31 affiliates kept the received funding despite receiving notice that they have received such funds illegally. As of March 23, 2021, 3 of the 31 Planned Parenthood affiliates again applied for and received second draw loans for a combined $4.8 million of additional funding.
The Abortion Providers Loan Elimination Act alters the Paycheck Protect Program to make Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers ineligible to receive a PPP loan and claws back the $80 million Planned Parenthood affiliates received.
When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, the federal government instituted the PPP which was intended to aid small businesses. At the height of the pandemic, Planned Parenthood Federation of America, a national organization with central control over its affiliates, over $2 billion in assets, and 16,000 employees applied for and received millions in PPP money.
Abortion providers have absolutely no business receiving PPP loans. It is a scandal that Planned Parenthood received loans through PPP in the first place. The money they received could have gone toward saving your favorite local restaurant or mom and pop shop, but instead Planned Parenthood took this money and used it to kill the unborn. I'm proud to join Senator Marshall in a bicameral effort to right this wrong and explicitly outlaw Planned Parenthood and other abortion providers from receiving these loans ever again.

District Work
Getting an update from Suddenlink

My staff and I are still working with Suddenlink as they improve their service to District 3 constituents. We had another call on April 22nd and I want to provide you all with some updates.
As I had hoped, the increase in staffing has remained consistent and Suddenlink has been continuing to improve their customer support line wait times. When we talked in March customers were waiting for two minutes on average. That was down from over an hour and this month they had that time down to 29 seconds. Because of this, they have seen customers give up on them less than 1.2% of the time - a 12-month low.
Suddenlink customers in District 3 should also be seeing an improvement in connection speeds. They have expanded access to gigabit internet in the Washington and Chocowinity areas. Including those new regions means 98% of North Carolina has access to gigabit service.
However, I am still concerned with the feedback I'm getting back from constituents when it comes to costs and billing transparency. Suddenlink needs to continue improving the simplicity of their fee structure and how they inform their customers about unexpected costs. To that effect, I have asked them to provide historical data about their costs year to year. This will help us understand the cost to the consumer overall as well.
Throughout this process Suddenlink has been more than willing to answer my questions and they have been showing improvement. I'm grateful for that and I look forward to speaking with them again in a few weeks.

Presenting American Flags to Pamlico County Veterans

Last weekend I traveled to a beautiful small church in Pamlico County where we had a wonderful ceremony to honor five veterans who have served this great nation. We also took time to honor veterans from this small community who have died in service to our country.

Onslow and Duplin County Pastors Breakfast

I had breakfast Thursday morning with some pastors from Onslow and Duplin Counties. The current chapter of American's political history has given us a great deal to be concerned about. Many have pushed God out of our lives and replaced Him with moral relativism. We need as a nation to get our foundation back. As such, it has never been more important to be centered in our faith. Thank you to everyone who participated!

Constituent Spotlight
Ricky Meadows, Dean of Career Programs at Craven Community College

It has never been more important to invest in the next generation. Students will be graduating into an ever-evolving labor market with new needs by the public and new technologies. Businesses now are already struggling to find candidates with the right experiences and education. Those problems are even more exacerbated in rural communities. Thankfully, we are lucky to have leaders like Ricky Meadows, Dean of Career Programs at Craven County Community College, who are willing to help.
After a lifetime of hard work and inspiring others to make the best of their situation, Dean Meadows was awarded the 2021 Community Fabric Leadership in Educator Award. His ability to look at the job market objectively and pivot the education needs of his students accordingly has won him well deserved praise. Thank you Dean Meadows for a fantastic job!

12/14/20 17:28,COVID-19 VACCINE UPDATE,"COVID-19 VACCINE UPDATE 
Friend-
Last week, the FDA approved the first COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use. This is historic. This vaccine will help us defeat COVID-19 and help to get our nation firmly on the road to recovery.  
While Pfizer did not accept Operation Warp Speed funding to develop their vaccine candidate, they did enter into a purchase agreement with HHS to produce and distribute 100 million initial vaccine doses and up to 500 million additional doses. 
The first doses of a Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine began shipping over the weekend, and the first vaccinations in the U.S. took place today. A critical care nurse was the first person in New York and among the first people in the United States to get a shot of the coronavirus vaccine authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration. Sandra Lindsay, an ICU nurse at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in Queens, New York City, was administered the vaccine during a live video event at about 9:20 a.m. ET on Monday. Dr. Michelle Chester, the corporate director of employee health services at Northwell Health, delivered the shot.
The vaccine is a two-dose shot and roughly 95% effective in preventing the virus. It’s likely to be administered to health-care and front-line workers first, followed closely by vulnerable populations like older people living in nursing homes. The arrival of a long-awaited vaccine offers the promise of a return to normal in the coming year, but health experts maintain public safety measures are still necessary while the drug is distributed.
You can read more details below. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to my office if you need anything.
Sincerely,
Rob
Commonwealth of Virginia and COVID-19 Vaccination
To prepare for the future availability of a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, Virginia’s Unified Command, which oversees the Commonwealth's response to COVID-19, established a Vaccine Unit to coordinate COVID-19 vaccination efforts.
Click here for comprehensive VDH COVID-19 Vaccination Response
In March 2020, the Commonwealth of Virginia established a Unified Command System to manage the state-level response to COVID-19. A Vaccine Unit was formed under the Public Health Surveillance and Guidance Workgroup of the Commonwealth’s unified command structure in June 2020 to conduct planning and coordination. Additionally, a COVID-19 Vaccine Advisory Workgroup was established in August 2020 to gather key stakeholder input on vaccine plans, priority groups, vaccine equity and other issuesrelated to distributing the vaccine. 
Virginia’s interim draft COVID-19 vaccination plan was developed by the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) and was recently exercised with partner state agencies. This plan will continue to be updated in collaboration with local health districts, the Virginia Emergency Support Team (VEST) and the COVID-19 Vaccine Advisory Workgroup as the federal government shares additional details and as more information becomes available about the vaccine(s). The most current information, including the full version of Virginia’s interim draft COVID-19 vaccination plan, is available at https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/immunization/covid19vaccine/.
The plan uses a phased approach that delivers the vaccine as it becomes available to a series of priority groups. Critical populations represent the top tier of the priority groups, including healthcare workers and nursing home residents followed by the general population. Particular emphasis will be placed on administering the vaccine using a health-equity framework to ensure that underserved and underrepresented individuals are able to receive vaccine.
Click here for comprehensive VDH COVID-19 Vaccination Response
CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), the National Institutes of Health and the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) are working to determine populations of focus for COVID-19 vaccination and ensure equity in access to COVID-19 vaccination availability across the United States. A key policy goal is to determine critical populations for COVID-19 vaccination including those groups identified to receive the first available doses of COVID-19 vaccine when supply is expected to be limited. VDH, in collaboration with partner agencies and organizations, is actively working to identify the critical infrastructure workforce, people at increased risk for severe COVID-19 illness and people at increased risk of acquiring or transmitting COVID-19.

Dept. of Veterans Affairs vaccine distribution
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has announced a preliminary plan for distributing COVID-19 vaccinations it will implement once the Food and Drug Administration issues an emergency use authorization for a vaccine. 
VA has worked in close coordination with the Centers and Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Operation Warp Speed to plan for COVID-19 vaccination of VA staff and Veterans.
VA will first provide vaccinations to front-line VA health care workers and Veterans residing in long-term care units in 37 of its medical centers across the country. 
The centers, listed below, were chosen for their ability to vaccinate large numbers of people and store the vaccines at extremely cold temperatures.
Health care workers will be among the first to receive vaccinations because they are at high risk for contracting and spreading COVID-19 to other staff members and patients, and their health is critical to ensuring the continued care of Veterans.
Veterans in VA’s long-term care facilities will be the first patient group to be vaccinated. As vaccine supplies increase, additional Veterans will receive vaccinations based on factors such as age, existing health problems and other considerations that increase the risk of severe illness or death from COVID-19.
VA anticipates a limited vaccine supply to start, but expects more supplies to be available in short order.
The 37 VA sites chosen for initial distribution of the vaccine will closely monitor patients and staff for side effects and log this information in its vaccine monitoring and tracking system. This is the same system VA uses to monitor reactions to all vaccines, including those for the flu and shingles.
VA will report directly to the CDC data on all vaccine doses administered by VA. The department will also provide general, public updates on the number of people who receive the vaccination at these sites, similar to how VA posts COVID-19 testing figures.
The 37 VA sites are spread throughout the country and include:
	•	Birmingham (AL) VA Health Care System
	•	Phoenix (AZ) VA Health Care System
	•	West Los Angeles (CA) VA Health Care System
	•	Palo Alto (CA) VA Health Care System

Friday 23 April 2021 
Weekly Report From Your Congresswoman 
 
Dear friends, 
All across the country the American people awaited the verdict in the trial of State of Minnesota v. Derek Chauvin. Justice was delivered to the family of George Floyd and the news reverberated around the world. I view this as a beginning of an effort, so long overdue, to address police killings. We feel relieved but we must reform by passing the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Our Pledge of Allegiance states ‘liberty and justice for all’ and now the moment has arrived to make these words a reality in America. 
Vaccine Update 
Thanks to the American Rescue Plan and the effective leadership of the Biden Administration, this week every adult in our country became eligible for the vaccine. This news came as the President announced that 200 million vaccine doses have been administered in less than 100 days. Please…do your part to protect yourself and others, and end the pandemic. Get vaccinated. You can sign up for a vaccine appointment at https://myturn.ca.gov. 
Johnson & Johnson Vaccine Update 
Today the CDC recommended the U.S. resume use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The vaccine will have a label warning of potential rare blood-clotting risks. The life-saving benefits of this vaccine far outweigh the very rare risks. If you are concerned, I recommend contacting your doctor with questions. 
Votes in the House this Week 
The NO BAN Act 
In January 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order banning refugees and travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries. This hateful ban was based on dangerous and xenophobic rhetoric about Muslims and it remained in effect in some form for nearly four years. President Biden rescinded it on his first day in office. 
This week I voted for the No BAN Act to prevent future administrations from enacting prejudicial travel bans by prohibiting religious discrimination in the issuance of visas. I’ve been a cosponsor of every version of this legislation since it was first introduced in 2017 and I’m very pleased to see it passed the House. The bill also establishes greater Congressional oversight of a president’s authority to restrict immigration and requires that future travel bans serve a “compelling government interest” in the least restrictive way. 
D.C. Statehood 
Many constituents have written to me in support of D.C. statehood and I appreciate each one. Washington, D.C. is home to over 700,000 residents, and despite paying more federal income taxes than 22 other states, residents lack voting representation in Congress. This week I voted for H.R. 51, the Washington, D.C. Admission Act to admit Washington, D.C. as the 51st state into the Union as the State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth. The new state, named in part for Frederick Douglass, would consist of 66 of the 68 square miles of the present-day federal district. The remaining two square miles would comprise the new federal district, or “Capital of the U.S.” and would include the White House, the Capitol complex, the Supreme Court, principal federal monuments, and federal buildings adjacent to the National Mall. I was proud to cast my vote in favor of statehood just as I did during my first term in Congress in 1993. 
The Access to Counsel Act 
All individuals – including U.S. citizens and green card holders – who seek to lawfully enter the United States are subject to inspection by Customs and Border Protection officers at ports of entry, but they are often denied a request to call a family member or their counsel if they are subjected to a lengthy inspection process. This legislation ensures that all individuals seeking legal entry into the United States at a port of entry can communicate with a family member, counsel, or other interested party if they are held for a lengthy inspection. 
Legislation Anna Cosponsored and Introduced 
Help for Local Gyms 
Because of COVID, tens of thousands of gyms and fitness facilities have closed their doors and 44% of jobs in the industry –1.4 million jobs – have been lost. There are 474 fitness facilities across San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz Counties, and nearly 9,000 people in our Congressional District are employed in the fitness industry. The Gym Mitigation and Survival (GYMS) Act would provide critical support for gyms, fitness studios and fitness facilities during this especially challenging time and I’m pleased to cosponsor this legislation. 
Understanding Cybersecurity of Mobile Networks 
This week I introduced a bipartisan bill, the Understanding Cybersecurity of Mobile Networks Act, which takes steps to ensure our mobile networks are safe and secure, a matter of national security and personal privacy. While 5G is inherently more secure than older networks, most of our calls, texts, and data still traverse on 2G, 3G, and 4G networks. My bill requires a comprehensive study of cyber vulnerabilities in our mobile networks to give policymakers a better understanding of the state of cybersecurity in our wireless networks. 
Letters Anna Wrote and Cosigned 
Recognizing the Armenian Genocide 
April 24th marks the 106th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, the first genocide of the 20th century and one that claimed the lives of 1.5 million Armenians, and hundreds of thousands of Assyrians, Greeks, Syriacs, Arameans, Maronites, and other Christians. As the daughter of survivors of the Armenian Genocide and the only Member of Congress of Armenian-Assyrian decent, I led the effort in Congress in October 2019 to pass a resolution that acknowledged the genocide, ending the over 100 years of official silence of the U.S. While the House and the Senate have both recognized the genocide, no U.S. president has ever done so. This week I joined over 100 of my colleagues urging President Biden to unequivocally affirm the Armenian Genocide. Doing so will help bring important closure to the victims and their families, a reckoning of the past, and the United States returning to its values of human rights around the world. 
Submit Complaints About Loud TV Ads! 
Some of you will recall that I authored a law in 2010 to address the nuisance of loud TV commercials. Unfortunately, complaints are rising again, so I wrote to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) requesting an investigation on the matter and the agency announced it is seeking public comment on loud TV commercial mitigation. I welcome the decision of the FCC to hear complaints from the American people, and I urge everyone who is annoyed by these jarring ads to submit their complaints to the FCC to ensure violations of the CALM Act can be investigated. You can submit your complaint HERE. 
Combating Foreign Propaganda 
The American people have a right to know when a foreign adversary is buying time on airwaves owned by us to broadcast anti-American propaganda. We know for a fact that Russian state-sponsored media outlets RT and Sputnik meddled in our 2016 elections and have continued to undermine trust in our democracy ever since. This week, I welcomed the FCC’s decision to finalize a rule requiring foreign government-sponsored broadcast TV and radio to identify themselves. I’ve been advocating for this step for four long years to defend our democracy and protect American airwaves. 
In the Words of My Constituents 
Every week hundreds of my constituents call and write to me to express their concerns, share their passions, and ask questions regarding legislation and policies. Over 46,438 constituents have contacted me in 2021. I actually read every communication and every constituent receives a personal response to their specific questions and comments from me. This week, 1,421 constituents contacted my office about issues including: 
	•	138 messages in support of statehood for Washington, D.C.
	•	127 messages in support of the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act
	•	98 messages in support of the End Polluter Welfare Act

We Need to Seize This Opportunity to Build on the Progress of the First 100 Days
Dear Neighbor: 
In the first 100 days of the 117th Congress, my colleagues and I have worked tirelessly to advance a number of critical priorities for the American people. My focus will always be with the people. I have fought for equal protection under the law, paycheck fairness, justice in policing and much more. Here's a quick look at the legislation we've passed so far in the U.S. House of Representatives: 
	•	The American Rescue Plan - A wide-ranging COVID-19 relief package providing vital economic aid to Florida families, small businesses, state and local governments and schools, along with many other relief efforts.

The American Jobs Plan Will Help Florida’s Urgent Infrastructure Needs 
There is an urgent need to address Florida’s critical infrastructure needs. From the number of bridges and miles of road in each state in poor condition, the percentage of households without access to broadband, to the billions of dollars required for water infrastructure, these pressing needs underscore the importance of the American Jobs Plan. To unlock our state’s full economic potential, we need to build up the systems and structures that support our modern economy. The American Jobs Plan is a once-in-a-lifetime chance to create millions of good-paying union jobs while bringing our infrastructure into the 21st century. Florida received a “C” grade on its Infrastructure Report Card from the American Society of Civil Engineers, facing many deficiencies that require immediate attention. Below are key statistics on the condition of the infrastructure in Florida, and how the American Jobs Plan will help:ROADS AND BRIDGES: In Florida, there are 408 bridges and over 3,564 miles of highway in poor condition. The American Jobs Plan will devote more than $600 billion to transform our nations' transportation infrastructure and make it more resilient, including $115 billion repairing roads and bridges.PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION: Floridians who take public transportation spend an extra 77.9% of their time. The American Jobs Plan will modernize public transit with an $85 billion investment.INFRASTRUCTURE: From 2010 to 2020, Florida has experienced 22 extreme weather events, costing the state up to $100 billion in damages. The President is calling for $50 billion to improve the resiliency of our infrastructure and support communities’ recovery from disaster.HOUSING: In part due to a lack of available and affordable housing, 1,445,000 renters in Florida are rent burdened, meaning they spend more than 30% of their income on rent. The President proposes investing over $200 billion to increase housing supply and address the affordable housing crisis.BROADBAND: 6% of Floridians live in areas where, by one definition, there is no broadband infrastructure that provides minimally acceptable speeds. And 51.1% of Floridians live in areas where there is only one such internet provider. The American Jobs Plan will invest $100 billion to bring universal, reliable, high-speed, and affordable coverage to every family in America.CAREGIVING: Across the country, hundreds of thousands of older adults and people with disabilities are in need of home and community-based services. The President’s plan will invest $400 billion to help more people access care and improve the quality of caregiving jobs.VETERAN HEALTH: Florida is home to more than 1.5 million veterans, 9.5% of whom are women and 53% of whom are over the age of 65. The President is calling for $18 billion to improve the infrastructure of VA health care facilities to ensure the delivery of world-class, state of the art care to veterans enrolled in the VA health care system. This includes improvements to ensure appropriate care for women and older veterans. 
  
Funeral Assistance for Floridians Who Have Lost Loved Ones Due to COVID-19 FEMA is accepting applications for funeral assistance for Floridians who have lost loved ones to COVID-19. I helped to pass the funeral assistance program as part of the American Rescue Plan. Residents who paid for funeral expenses after January 20, 2020, for an individual whose death may have been caused by or was likely the result of COVID-19 can apply for up to $9,000 of assistance per funeral. Individuals may apply for assistance for multiple funerals. To apply, contact FEMA’s dedicated call center at 844-684-6333; TTY 800-462-7585, Monday-Friday, 9 AM ET - 9 PM ET. For more information, visit https://www.fema.gov/disasters/coronavirus/economic/funeral-assistance/faq. No online applications will be accepted. 
  
USDA to Provide Critical Nutrition Assistance to Kids Over the Summer 
 
  
The USDA launched a new effort to provide adequate nutrition to more than 30 million children over the summer by expanding Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT) benefits. Summer feeding programs reach just a small fraction, typically less than 20%, of the number served during the school year. P-EBT was established in March 2020 to provide food dollars to families to make up for meals missed when schools have closed due to COVID-19. The program was set to expire on September 30, 2021, but through the American Rescue Plan Act, benefits are now available for the duration of the pandemic, including during the summer months. Children are eligible for this temporary nutrition benefit – loaded onto an EBT card that can then be used to purchase food – if they are eligible to receive free or reduced-price meals during the school year or if they are under age six and live in a SNAP household. Families of eligible children typically receive $6.82 per child, per weekday, or roughly $375 per child over the summer months. There are 29 million adults and up to as many as 12 million children have not haven’t always had enough to eat throughout this pandemic. However, recent data from the Census Bureau shows food insecurity among adults has fallen from 14 percent to 9 percent from December 2020 to April 2021.For more information, visit https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/state-guidance-coronavirus-pandemic-ebt-pebt   
  
Post Office Renaming is Meaningful Way to Honor Local Activist 
 
I recently introduced a bill to designate the United States Post Office at 2800 South Adams Street in Tallahassee, Florida as the “D. Edwina Stephens Post Office.” The bill has the bipartisan support of all 25 Congressional House Members from the Florida Delegation. Edwina Stephens, who passed away in 2011 at the age of 86, was a dedicated community activist, civil rights icon and registered nurse. She spent her life advocating for improvements in her community, especially in the historically neglected neighborhoods on Tallahassee’s Southside and in the Greater Bond community.Naming a post office in Tallahassee is a meaningful way to honor Edwina Stephens’ enduring legacy and her unyielding fight for justice.  Mrs. Stephens’ influence and kindred spirit will never go unnoticed. She was an inspiration to many and will be remembered as the heart of our community.  
Jacksonville Student Appointed to the U.S. Naval Academy  
 
 I am proud to announce that I am proud to announce that Jacksonville University student Gil Sahagun received an offer of appointment to the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. Gil was one of my nominees for the military academy.  His upstanding character and hunger to learn is just what the Naval Academy needs. I congratulate him on his appointment and look forward to seeing where the academy takes him. Sahagun’s inspiration for pursuing the Naval Academy stems from his desire to be a life-long learner.  
He has a passion for public servitude and plans to use his experience at the Naval academy to serve his country on a larger scale. Gil consecutively made his high school’s Academic Honor Roll and served as the National Honor Society’s Vice President. As a Leadership Cadet for the Reserved Officers Training Corps (ROTC), he worked to educate and mentor new cadets. He also participated in his school’s varsity tennis, swimming and track teams.

Dear Friend,
Over the weekend the COVID-19 vaccine was approved, and distribution has now started. The approval of the COVID-19 vaccine, a true miracle of American innovation, marks the beginning of the end of the pandemic. Congratulations, and thank you to the leaders of Operation Warp Speed and the amazing scientists who made this a reality. Last week, I sent letters to Congressional Leadership calling on Congress to address the American people and small businesses still struggling, and you can read the full letters below. 
Letter to Congressional Leadership  I was proud to lead a letter with my Problem Solvers Caucus colleagues to Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, Leader McConnell, and Leader Schumer, calling for a bipartisan, bicameral agreement on COVID relief before the end of the year. Read the full letter here.  Freshmen Letter calling for restoring the deductibility of forgiven PPP loans  Earlier this week, with more than 50 bipartisan freshmen members, I sent a letter to Speaker Pelosi and Leader McCarthy calling for restoring the deductibility of forgiven PPP loans. “By disallowing PPP loan recipients the ability to deduct forgiven PPP loan expenses, this is a surprise tax increase to businesses struggling to stay afloat. This is not what Congress intended.” reads the letter. Read the full letter here. 
Featured Constituent, U.S. Army Veteran, and New American Citizen  Robert Rivera had long hoped to obtain US citizenship when he attended a Veteran’s Service Event hosted by Congressman Gonzalez’s office earlier this year at the Strongsville VFW post. Staff members learned of Mr. Rivera’s prior service to our nation, and they were able to help him apply for citizenship since his service was during a time of hostility. Read more about Robert’s story here. 
  

 Legislation included in the FY 2021 National Defense Authorization Act  Multiple pieces of legislation that I authored and co-sponsored were included in the Fiscal Year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act including the Accountability for World Bank Loans to China Act. This legislation aims to curb World Bank funding to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) by directing the U.S. Governor for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) to seek China’s graduation from the program. Despite far exceeding the economic threshold for the program, the CCP has received $7.8 billion from the World Bank IBRD since 2016. The legislation also includes provisions to help protect poor and middle-income countries that the CCP seeks to take advantage of through their Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Learn more about all of my legislation included in the NDAA.    IOGAN Act headed to the President’s desk  The bill, the Identifying Outputs of Generative Adversarial Networks Act (IOGAN Act), supports critical research to accelerate the development of technology to identify deepfakes which could erode public trust, scam the American public, and endanger national security. Read more about the IOGAN Act here. 
 Happy Hanukkah to everyone celebrating!

    
Sincerely, 
  Anthony Gonzalez Member of Congress

View Email in Browser 
 
Dear Friend,
Every year, it is vital that Congress passes the National Defense Authorization Act in order for Congress to determine how best to utilize the dollars from hard-working American taxpayers for our national defense and security priorities.
Yesterday, H.R. 6395, the William M. Thornberry National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) passed by a bipartisan vote of 335-78.
This year, the NDAA will include a cost of living raise for the servicemen and servicewomen who defend our nation. It will also support our local mission at the Little Rock Air Force Base (LRAFB) by allocating funds to upgrade our nation’s C-130 fleet and enabling LRAFB to continue its crucial role in our military’s airlift capabilities in the years to come.
This year’s NDAA also includes two of my national security priorities, both of which already passed the House of Representatives with bipartisan approval.
One of these policies, the Ensuring Chinese Debt Transparency Act, will address the transparency of lending terms between developing countries and China. With the expansion of the Chinese Community Party’s (CCP) ‘Belt and Road’ initiative, and the country’s growing role as an international creditor, there is a need for greater transparency within lending terms to ensure that the CCP does not take advantage of developing nations and economies. My legislation would promote this transparency and regulate the guidelines by which developing countries receive lending from the CCP and other international financial institutions (IFIs), such as the IMF and World Bank.
The other bill included was the Cooperate with Law Enforcement Agencies and Watch (CLAW) Act, which helps the financial services industry partner with law enforcement agencies to monitor the flow of cash associated with criminal activities.
During my time as a community banker, I was conflicted between wanting to help law enforcement agencies but being limited by Anti-Money Laundering or Bank Secrecy Act requirements. My bill would promote cooperation between these two groups allowing law enforcement agencies to keep our financial system safe from criminals and terrorists while removing the conflicting repercussions for the financial services industry.
I am proud that the passage of the NDAA will implement policies such as these, and that our country will continue to safeguard our national security.


WORKING TO ACHIEVE BIPARTISAN COVID-19 RELIEF

 As Congress continues to deliberate on a COVID-19 relief package, I will continue to fight for Arkansas families, workers, and small businesses.  
In my interview with KARK News’ Jay Bir, I talked about how House Republicans are advocating for a bill that will extend the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), increase the flexibility that governors have to spend funds from the CARES Act and increase funding for vaccine development and distribution.  

 Over the past few months, Speaker Pelosi has consistently failed to negotiate with House Republicans to produce a bipartisan piece of legislation to implement COVID-19 relief. That is why House Republicans are working to produce a bill with a bipartisan group of senators, which will provide needed relief for hardworking Americans.
This proposed bill will extend funds from the CARES Act to governors until September 2021, as well as provide funds for vaccine distribution and COVID-19 tracing and testing.
It will also provide funding to our educational institutions, which have been hit hard by the pandemic, and extend the PPP providing our restaurants, hotels, and small businesses a second chance at applying for the program.
I will continue to fight for solutions that will give Arkansans the tools they need to help defeat the virus and restore our economy. 

HBCU LEGISLATION PASSES HOUSE


Developing Career Opportunities for Arkansas Students
Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) play a critical role in America by giving thousands of students the opportunity to pursue their dreams and aspirations.
As the Vice-Chair of the bipartisan Congressional HBCU Caucus, I am encouraged by Senator Tim Scott’s legislation, the HBCU PARTNERS Act, as it draws upon partnerships – public, private, and community – to strengthen our HBCUs.
Recently, I spoke on the House Floor to encourage my colleagues to vote with me in favor of the HBCU PARTNERS Act in order to help students achieve a college education and help them start on the pathway to achieving their academic and career aspirations.
In central Arkansas, we are blessed with four outstanding HBCUs – Arkansas Baptist College, Philander Smith College, Shorter College, and the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff. I am committed to supporting our HBCUs and helping Arkansas students graduate prepared for a competitive global economy.
Last year, I hosted the first HBCU Summit in Little Rock to support and develop partnerships for our HBCUs in philanthropy, student recruitment and advancement, workforce partnerships, and apprenticeship programs.
Every student in America deserves the opportunity to succeed in the global competitive environment. For thousands of students in Arkansas and across the country, HBCUs offer the essential tools to help students seize that opportunity.  


HONG KONG LEGISLATION PASSES HOUSE

 As the people of Hong Kong cry out to the free world for support against tyranny, the United States stands at their side, calling on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to honor our 1984 treaty commitments and aid those seeking refuge and freedom.
Recently, I spoke on the House Floor to encourage our elected leaders to support the people of Hong Kong in their pursuit of democracy against the CCP, which threatens Hong Kong’s freedom and autonomy.
I commend Congressman Tom Malinowski (D-NJ) on his bill, H.R. 8428, the Hong Kong People’s Freedom and Choice Act, which will give those seeking refuge on our shores the protection they need. 
Like all nations around the globe, the people of Hong Kong look to the United States as a symbol of freedom and democracy and as a nation that stands as a beacon of hope in a sea of global despair for two and a half centuries.
In my travels to Hong Kong, I have witnessed firsthand the innovative spirit and dedicated work ethic of its citizens. Hongkongers, like those in many nations, look to the United States as a symbol of freedom and opportunity, and likewise want to emulate those principles in their own government.
We must continue to fight for Hongkongers and allow these democracy-loving people to taste the freedoms we Americans get to enjoy every day.   


INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION BROADCAST WITH ARKANSAS STUDENTS


Downlink Conversation Livestream Available
This Thursday, December 10, Nettleton STEAM Intermediate School students are preparing for a once in a lifetime experience. Students in grades 3-6 science classes will share a downlink conversation with the astronauts aboard the International Space Station.
Arkansas PBS has partnered with NASA, Arkansas State University, Arkansas Department of Education Division of Elementary and Secondary Education, and Nettleton High School to promote this exciting event.
While the astronauts aboard the International Space Station are accustomed to sharing downlinks with different organizations here on Earth – no one has ever communicated with the Space Station directly from Arkansas – until now!
In celebration of the twentieth anniversary of astronauts living and working continuously aboard the International Space Station, NASA offered the chance for young astronauts here on Earth to earn the opportunity to communicate with the scientists currently aboard.
I congratulate the students of Nettleton STEAM Intermediate School for this opportunity, and I commend them on their hard work put into their projects this semester. The students’ water filtration systems, robotic arms, plant growth chambers, and space suits are an amazing achievement for primary education. They are exemplary young scientists: using the tools and technology of today to help solve the problems of tomorrow.
Arkansas PBS will be capturing the magic of the downlink conversations, which will begin with a pre-event show, featuring opening remarks from Arkansas leaders including Governor Asa Hutchinson and former President Bill Clinton. We will also have space-inspired art and music created by Nettleton STEAM students.
The pre-event will start at 9:30 AM CT, and the in-flight downlink is scheduled for 10:25 AM tomorrow. To view the livestream, please visit HERE. 
 


RECOGNIZING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF ARKANSAS STUDENTS: CLAYTON BOOTHE

In Arkansas, I am proud that our students strive to follow their goals and set themselves on a path destined for success.
Earlier this week, I honored the achievements and aspirations of Mr. Clayton Boothe -- a student at Maumelle High School.
Clayton has a broad span of interests -- from founding his high school's chess team to being a member of the National Honor Society, ranked at the top of his class, and a semi-finalist in the 2021 National Merit Scholarship program, out of 1.5 million national applicants.
As an aspiring novelist and member of the Arkansas Symphony Youth Orchestra, Clayton also has high academic aspirations, as he plans to attend Northwestern University in Chicago.
Clayton is a bright and dedicated young man, and I expect him to succeed wherever life takes him.

2/26/21 20:50,Rep. Weber (TX-14) Statement on the American Rescue Plan of 2021,"For Immediate Release
Contact: Lisa Reynolds

 Rep. Weber (TX-14) Statement on the American Rescue Plan of 2021
Washington, D.C. – Friday, February 26, 2021, U.S. Rep. Randy Weber (TX-14) issued the following statement on H.R. 1319 – American Rescue Plan of 2021.   ""Once again exploiting the pandemic, Democrats' forced through a $1.9 trillion bailout under the guise of COVID-19 relief.  This enormous bailout follows the $4 trillion already spent on direct aid to American households, unemployment insurance,  stimulus checks, rental assistance, testing and hospital visits, small business loans, PPP funds, law enforcement assistance, firefighter grants, healthcare, health providers, pharmaceutical companies, vaccine rollout, and education. All that, and we still have $1 trillion from the previous aid packages that have gone unspent!
""This legislation is not designed to help Americans recover from the pandemic. It is designed to implement a four-year-long wish list of partisan policies. Only 9% of the current bill’s spending is focused on COVID relief.  The other 91% is designated to partisan political priorities.
""Some of these priorities include:
	•	Controversial Silicon Valley Underground Tunnel
	•	$350 billion in blue state bailouts
	•	$86 billion in union pension bailouts
	•	$34 billion to expand Obamacare
	•	$200 million for the Institute of Museum and Library Services
	•	$135 million to the National Endowment of the Arts
	•	$1,400/week for 15 weeks to federal bureaucrats to stay home and not work if their kid's school is remote.
""Not only are these policies partisan and wasteful, but they also discourage the reopening of schools, disincentivize employees from returning to work, reward federal employees at the expense of everyday Americans, incentivize further lockdowns and stifle honest attempts to successfully reopen the economy.
""At its best, this bill would be an attempt to throw money at a problem -- a problem you can’t solve with money.  At worst, it is a shameless attempt to deceive our citizens -- masquerading bailouts of failed liberal policies as pandemic relief for Americans.
""For these reasons, how could anyone in good conscience vote for this bill?  I vote NO.""

BROADBAND 
Take a Speed Test Here. 
The sad fact is that many places in West Virginia simply do not have access to reliable broadband and the lack of access affects West Virginians every day. Back in 2015, the FCC released a coverage map that stated 99.9% of Americans had wireless coverage. I knew then what I know now: That is just plain wrong. 
HOW MAY WE HELP YOU? 
To request assistance from my case team, click here.  As your U.S. Senator, I am proud to be your voice with government agencies during your time of need. My goal is for me and my staff to provide the best possible customer service for every West Virginian who contacts me needing assistance.

Mr. Arnold Meadows, of Beaver, is an Air Force Veteran who served in both the Korean War and Vietnam War. He and his wife, Rosa, contacted the Senator for assistance with his pending appeal for service-connected benefits. As the result of Caseworker Kim Berry’s inquiry, Arnold’s appeal was advanced and the BVA granted his service-connected benefits as well as additional home assistance.

JANUARY 19, 2021: MANCHIN STATEMENT ON THE DEATH OF DENNIS DAVIS   Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) today released the following statement on the death of Dennis Davis, Cabinet Secretary for the West Virginia Department of Veterans Assistance.   ""Gayle and I are deeply saddened to hear of the loss of our dear friend, Dennis Davis, Cabinet Secretary for the West Virginia Department of Veterans Assistance. We extend our deepest condolences to his loving wife Margaret and their five children. As a U.S. Army Veteran and a lifelong resident of Institute, Dennis truly exemplified what it means to be a proud West Virginian and American. Dennis came from a family of Veterans and used his career as Cabinet Secretary to serve his fellow Veterans across the Mountain State. He worked closely with my team and the entire West Virginia delegation over the years, always putting service above self and our Veterans best interest above politics. He was a joy to work with and to know as a friend. I am so deeply proud of what West Virginians like Dennis have achieved and what they will continue to accomplish for the cause of freedom. Dennis is part of an incredible legacy of excellence, bravely serving our nation and paying it forward to his fellow Veterans. His service and sacrifice will never be forgotten."" 
JANUARY 17, 2021: MANCHIN STATEMENT ON CELEBRATING MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. DAY  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) released the following statement in advance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day tomorrow.  ""Today we celebrate and honor the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., one of our nation’s most inspiring and important figures in American history. Dr. King led a revolutionary movement for civil rights and changed our society for the better. His leadership provided us a vision for what America could be. This past year has been difficult for many Americans, especially our communities of color who are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. My grandparents taught me that if you can count your blessings you can share your blessings and Dr. King taught us that the values of love, unity and forgiveness are some of the most important values in our society. Let us all remember Dr. King’s memory by reaching out to our fellow West Virginians to create unity and share our blessings during these difficult times.”

WORKING FOR YOU
JANUARY 13, 2021: MANCHIN, CAPITO ANNOUNCE $339 MILLION FOR COVID-19 RELIEF TO WEST VIRGINIA SCHOOLS  Charleston, WV - U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $339,000,000 from the U.S. Department of Education as part of the most recent COVID-19 relief package to help West Virginia schools respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. This funding can be used for testing, to address learning loss, and to assist schools in ways like improving air quality in buildings as schools prepare for eventual reopening. This funding was made available through the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER), and builds on a previously announced award from the CARES Act at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  ""The COVID-19 pandemic hit our students, teachers, and faculty hard, forcing them to quickly adjust to new ways of learning and teaching. During the negotiations for the emergency COVID-19 relief package passed at the end of last year, I advocated for this funding to support our schools and students as they navigate these difficult times. I’m glad West Virginia has received this funding to help with testing and other priorities and will continue to fight for West Virginia priorities in any future relief legislation,"" said Senator Manchin.   
JANUARY 13, 2021: MANCHIN, CAPITO ANNOUNCE FUNDING TO EXPAND COVID-19 TESTING, VACCINE DISTRIBUTION IN WEST VIRGINIA  Charleston, WV – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $119,346,660 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) through the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act. Of the $119,346,660 appropriated for West Virginia, $103,153,083 is allocated for expanded COVID-19 testing and contact tracing, while $16,193,577 will be used for assistance in distributing the COVID-19 vaccine.   ""As cases continue to rise in West Virginia and across the nation, we must expand COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, and vaccinations so we can defeat this terrible pandemic,"" Senator Manchin said. ""This funding will help West Virginia ensure vaccines are administered to every West Virginian who wants one as they become available and will support the testing and contact tracing programs across the state that help slow the spread of the virus. We must keep working together to beat the COVID-19 virus, and I will continue to fight for West Virginia to receive funding that helps our neighbors, family and friends stay as safe as possible during these difficult times.”

Media
A Doctor's Note 
Over the past several weeks I’ve been able to travel back to the great state of Kansas numerous times to meet with constituents and hold 15 town halls. On Saturday, I held town halls in Nemaha, Brown, and Doniphan Counties. These opportunities to have real conversations with fellow Kansans about their ideas and about the issues impacting their lives are my favorite part of the job.   The big news of the week in our nation’s capital was President Biden’s address to Congress. I attended the address in person, and it was the lowest energy speech I have ever personally heard on the House floor. Instead of using this opportunity to promote bipartisanship and unity, President Biden pitched his partisan wish list that raises taxes, spends more money, increases regulations, and pushes the American people to government dependency. If President Biden truly puts unity above all else, we can accomplish great things for our nation, but his radical, partisan ways will only further divide this nation.  I'm honored to serve as your voice in Washington, D.C. My family and I take this responsibility seriously and we are proud to represent all Kansans in the U.S. Senate. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me on my website: https://www.marshall.senate.gov/.  Sincerely,  
Prebuttal to Biden’s Address to Congress
Prior to President Biden’s address to the joint session of Congress, I delivered remarks on the Senate floor. 100 days in office and there has been zero bipartisanship from the White House on any major issue. Democrats have shown they are not interested in bipartisanship as they continue to jam through their radical agenda and seek power grab after power grab. Unfortunately, President Biden’s speech was about government control of our lives and it was so hard to listen to the radical policy carefully hidden between colloquialisms, false claims, and boasts. Instead of hearing about solutions to the real issues our country is facing, we heard more of President Biden’s pitch to sell his partisan wish list that raises taxes, spends more money, increases regulations, and pushes the American people to government dependency. Make no mistake, if he truly puts unity above all else, we can accomplish great things for the American people. For it is unity that will see this country come roaring back – not President Biden’s radical, partisan ways that have further divided this nation. 

During an interview with Good Morning America about the President’s Address to Congress I discussed whether or not Democrats and Republicans can find common ground. I think that President Biden and I agree on this big picture of America – that Middle America built this nation and that we want a stronger economy, we just disagree on how to get there. Click HERE or on the image below to watch the full interview. 

COVID-19 Vaccine Participation
I led a group of Republican doctors and other health care providers in Congress in the launch of a public service campaign to boost COVID-19 vaccine participation. It’s obvious to me from a medical standpoint, the only way to protect yourself and your loved ones, and to end the government’s restrictions on our freedoms is to take action and get the vaccine. However, the beauty of living in this great nation is that we have the option to choose whether or not we get vaccinated. When the time comes for you to make that decision, I encourage you to talk it over with your doctor or your pharmacist and consider their recommendation. Click HERE or on the image below to watch the PSA. 

Legislation Banning Abortion Providers from PPP Participation
Last week, I introduced the Abortion Providers Loan Elimination (APLE) Act, which requires Planned Parenthood affiliates to return the $80 million in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans they illegally applied for and received. It would also ensure Planned Parenthood affiliates, and other abortion providers, remain ineligible for future PPP funding, and instruct the Small Business Administration (SBA) to investigate how this national organization was able to receive funds from the program. Like most Americans, I was outraged to hear Planned Parenthood affiliates gamed the system and illegally obtained millions of dollars through the program. It’s clear to me that Americans don’t want their hard earned tax dollars to fund abortions, and this bill prevents that from happening. Click HERE for more information.

Congressional Report
 
 
Dear Friend,
President Biden, his administration, and I went straight to work after the inauguration. Since January 20th, we've seen the President announce his COVID-19 national strategy as well as sign Executive Actions to address economic, immigration and border wall issues. 
 
 
 
One of the more significant updates from President Biden’s executive order is the announcement that all border wall construction activities must be paused by today- January 27, 2021.  This a promising step in our work to halt construction and undo the damage that borderlands have experienced these past four years. However, our work continues. I remain steadfast in my commitment to working with the new administration until every border wall contract is terminated and all construction crews leave our border communities.
 
I want to remind everyone that we must remain diligent in protecting ourselves and our l0ved-ones during this pandemic. Remember to wear a mask and maintain social distance until we are able to vaccinate all of our communities. 
 
As always, if you need help with a federal agency, please reach out to one of my offices.
 
 

 
 
Conversation with Cuellar
 

  
On Friday, January 22nd, I held a virtual ‘Conversation with Cuellar’ to discuss President Biden’s bold Executive Actions to defeat the virus and deliver much needed relief for the American public.

Inauguration of President Biden and Vice President Harris
 

  
On Wednesday, January 20th, I attended the Inauguration of President Joseph R. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.

Texas Department of State Health Services: How to Fight ""COVID-19 Fatigue""
 
 

 
  
This pandemic has taken a toll on all of us, both mentally and physically. I know many may be tired or anxious to get back to your normal way of life, but it's important that we don't let our guard down. If we want to crush the virus, we must continue to vaccinate communities, wear a mask, practice social distancing, and stay home when feeling ill. 
 
 
In this week's video the Texas Department of State Health Services explains what 'pandemic fatigue' is and why taking care of your mental and emotional well-being is just as critical as taking care of your physical well-being. 
 

 
Sincerely,

  
Henry Cuellar

1/17/21 21:18,"Peace, Prosperity, Liberty, and Justice for All","Dear Friends,  Ohio has announced plans to move into Phase 1B of its COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan. Tomorrow, individuals 80 years and older will be eligible to receive their first dose of the vaccine. Individuals 75 years and older will be eligible the following Monday. I continue urging Ohioans to learn the facts about the vaccines, talk to their trusted doctors, and protect themselves, their families, and their communities.

President-elect Joe Biden will be sworn in as the 46th President of the United States after running on a promise of uniting the country. Putting the country through another impeachment process in the last week of the President’s term in office will only further divide us. Public officials across the political spectrum need to collectively lower the temperature of our nation. We would best serve our constituents and the country by ensuring an orderly and peaceful transfer of power, rather than forcing through the House a rushed and inherently political impeachment.
 
Democratic leadership has stated they may delay transmitting the article of impeachment to the Senate for up to 100 days, and the Senate has already stated they cannot take up an impeachment trial until after President-elect Biden has been sworn in. Impeachment is a grave power; it must not be exercised in haste.
 
Investigations into the tragic events of January 6th are still ongoing. The facts of the day have not been fully uncovered. However, it is already clear that many came to Washington, D.C., prepared for violence before any words were spoken at the morning rally. It would be prudent to wait for all of the facts to come to light if we are to properly evaluate the gravity of the situation. If Members of Congress want to build a serious and credible case against President Trump, they should wait until we have a complete, factual understanding of what transpired. Given these concerns and limitations, I cannot support this impeachment that is markedly short of due process.
“In the wake of these events, our nation – all of us – must take a deep breath and do some soul searching. Every individual American needs to take a long look in the mirror and examine what we say, how we say it, and the actions we take.
 
Last Wednesday’s extremely egregious events did not happen in a vacuum. Our country has seen escalating political violence in recent years, and individuals are responsible for the actions they take. Unfortunately, I am no stranger to that political violence, having survived the politically-motivated shooting by a far-left extremist inspired by Bernie Sanders on a baseball field four years ago. I chose then to not – and still do not – hold Senator Sanders responsible.
 
Ultimately, everyone is responsible for their own actions. I said that then, I said that during the riots of the past summer, and I say that again now.
 
Nobody should be encouraging or excusing violent riots of any sort, whether they gripped our cities last summer or infiltrated our Capitol last week. We cannot continue to say things like, ‘You create a crowd. And you push back on them’; ‘you have to go to the streets and be as violent as Antifa, BLM’; and, ‘People do what they do.’ Our words matter, and we cannot give encouragement or acceptance of violent behavior.
“President Trump’s actions and words during the violence last Wednesday were inappropriate. He failed to quickly and unequivocally condemn the violence wrought upon the Capitol, which was bravely defended by our selfless Capitol Police Officers. Today, the President’s legacy is already entrenched in the minds of every American, as is the legacy of all those who have called for or committed violence in America.
 
The course we are on will only cause more division rather than the unity we need. I will continue to work toward a more perfect union with peace, prosperity, liberty, and justice for all.

2/7/21 22:35,Weekly Wrap Up,"Dear Neighbor,
It was another eventful week, and I am glad to send you this update. 
I returned to Washington on Tuesday.  That evening, Capitol Police Officer Brian D. Sicknick returned to the United States Capitol to lie in honor.  Officer Sicknick was killed in the line of duty on January 6 as he defended the Capitol and those inside it.  As one of the people in the House of Representatives chamber that day, I know that his actions—and the actions of the Capitol Police officers present—saved our lives and protected our constitutional system.  I was grateful for the opportunity to pay my respects to Officer Sicknick as he lay in honor in the Capitol Rotunda.


Yesterday marked 30 days since one of the darkest days in our country’s history.  The events of January 6 are very much with us in Washington: the Capitol is still being protected by the National Guard, new fencing surrounds it, and other new measures are in place to ensure safety.  Several investigations are in progress to perform a thorough review of all aspects of the insurrection—and it is vitally important that we understand and learn from what happened.  On Tuesday, the trial of former President Trump will begin in the Senate following his impeachment in the House.
At the same time Congress responds to these serious threats to our democracy, we are moving forward to address the threats families across the country face as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, including so many here in TX07.

Responding to the coronavirus is the highest priority of the Congress.  This week, Congress took critical first steps to deliver on President Biden’s American Rescue Plan.  Congress plans to pass this legislation using the budget process and a budget process called reconciliation.  The House and the Senate both passed a budget resolution that will begin this process.  Next week, House Committees will be writing the legislation to deliver on this plan. 
The House Energy & Commerce Committee that I serve on will have an important role in crafting key parts of this legislation.  This week, we held two hearings on relevant issues.  Our Health Subcommittee hearing, “Road to Recovery: Ramping Up COVID-19 Vaccines, Testing, and Medical Supply Chain” focused on improving our national response to COVID-19, especially the increased and expedited delivery of vaccines, the disjointed patchwork of state testing plans, and supply chain constraints on essential medical supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE).  (You can watch my questions here).
Our Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce held our first hearing, “Safeguarding American Consumers: Fighting Scams and Fraud During the Pandemic.”  Since the beginning of the pandemic, Americans have reported losing more than $300 million in pandemic-related fraud, and we learned about the scams, fake products, and price-gouging, as well as ways to combat them.  
If you would like to learn more about the House Energy & Commerce Committee and keep up with our work, click here.
I introduced two bills this week.  I reintroduced the bipartisan Loan Interest Forgiveness for Taxpayers Under a Pandemic (LIFT UP) Act, which I also filed last Congress, to help small businesses obtain equitable access to debt forgiveness during the coronavirus pandemic while also rebuilding from storms like Harvey.  I was glad to introduce this bipartisan bill with Congressman Michael McCaul.


I also introduced the Expand Medicaid Now Act, designed to increase the amount of federal funding for Medicaid expansion in an effort to encourage those states that have not expended their programs to do so.  Texas has the highest rate of uninsured people in the country.  It is vitally important for Texas to expand Medicaid now and ensure that families have access to affordable, quality health care as we continue to confront the coronavirus pandemic.
I also co-sponsored several bills this week, many of which I co-sponsored in the last Congress, including:
	•	The USPS Fairness Act, to end the United States Postal Service’s pre-funding mandate on future retiree health benefits, which will help the USPS address financial issues;
	•	The RESTAURANTS Act, to create a $120 billion restaurant revitalization fund;  
	•	The Big Cat Public Safety Act, to prohibit the private ownership of big cats like tigers, lions, leopards, and pumas and end the abusive cub petting industry;
	•	The Emmett Till Antilynching Act, to make lynching a federal crime that warrants an enhanced sentence under hate crimes statues;
	•	The Gun Violence Prevention Research Act, to authorize $50 million in funding each fiscal year for the next five years at the CDC to study gun violence; and
	•	The Scientific Integrity Act, to set clear, enforceable standards for federal agencies and federally funded research to keep public science independent from political or special interest meddling.
In addition to co-sponsoring bills, I also joined colleagues in sending several letters to the Biden administration and to House leadership, including:
	•	A letter to HHS Acting Secretary Becerra asking for demographic data on COVID-19 vaccinations;
	•	A letter to Governor Abbott asking the Governor to allow Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas to serve Medicaid insured patients during the pandemic;
	•	A letter led to President Biden urging the appointment of an Ambassador to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism; and
	•	A letter to Education Secretary-Designate Cardona urging the replacement of former Secretary Devos' final rule prescribing how K-12 schools and postsecondary institutions must respond to sexual harassment and assault under Title IX.
You can see all the bills I have cosponsored at Congress.gov (click here).  And you can view my full voting record on my website (click here).




I was proud to announce that our constituent services team—including Shirley, Claudia, and Spencer—has helped more than 3,500 families in our district get the help they need with federal agencies.  It is a privilege for me and for our district team to be able to provide real assistance to our neighbors, especially in these difficult times.
In my 2020 Annual Report, I reported that COVID-19-related casework represented more than 44 percent of all cases closed we closed in 2020, with residents seeking assistance with the Texas Workforce Commission, Small Business Administration, and the Internal Revenue Service. 
See stories from the constituents we have helped here—and if you need assistance with federal agencies, you can begin the process here or call my office at (713) 353-8680.  

While Congress and the Biden Administration seek solutions and build strategies to shore up public health agencies, ramp up vaccines, and address the impacts COVID-19 has had on our economy and well-being as a country, it is critical that we all do our part to stay healthy and keep our loved ones safe.
As of Friday, there have been 326,248 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Houston/Harris County and 3,026 deaths and 279,184 patients have recovered.  The positivity rate is 17.3%, slightly lower than last week.  Some of the highest confirmed case rates in our region are in the Cy-Fair area.  COVID-19 variants have now begun to spread nationally, including here in Texas, and we are at a critical moment where vaccines could slow the rate of spread.  We also know that these variants are spreading quickly.  For these reasons, it is important to continue protecting yourself and others through the use of face coverings, social distancing, and hand washing and getting the vaccine when you are able to do so.
Harris County’s ReadyHarris website now has a portal where all residents are invited to sign up to get the vaccine.  Although still in the early stages of rollout, patients who sign up will be called when it is their turn to get the vaccine.  For the City of Houston’s vaccination efforts, you can register for notifications about new appointments by subscribing to the HoustonRecovers option at AlertHouston.  And for those who have received a first dose of the vaccine, do not forget to go back when it is time to get the required second dose in order for the vaccine to be fully effective.


These are difficult times for our country.  I am honored and proud to be your representative to the Congress, and to do my part to ensure that we successfully address the many challenges before us.  As always, please do not hesitate to call on me and my team if there is anything we can do to help you or if there is anything you want me to know.  You can email here or call (713) 353-8680 or (202) 225-2571 at any time.
With best wishes,





	•	Valentines for Veterans are due Tuesday, February 10!  I will be delivering them to the Michael DeBakey VA Hospital later this week.  Fill out this form for details and a member of my team will contact you.
	•	Paycheck Protection Program applications are open and will close Wednesday, March 31.  Begin the process now; consult my Small Business Resource Guide for details or contact my office with questions.

Dear friend,
Back in March, we didn't know what to expect when our world changed due to a virus called COVID-19. In the past few months, we've endured unprecedented challenges.
As coronavirus cases spiked, our country experienced profound events this year. A renewed dialogue on racial justice drew millions to the streets to demand change, countless businesses were forced to close their doors and millions lost their jobs before a record-breaking number of citizens cast votes for one of the most tumultuous presidential elections in history.
We've been through a lot this year, but better days are ahead.
It's not easy getting through a time of year that's usually filled with warmth and cheerful gatherings with friends, family, and peers. In 2020 we're all required to make sacrifices to stay safe and healthy. I want to thank you for your continued engagement and support. I wish you happy holidays, a merry Christmas and happy new year.

COVID-19 Emergency Relief Package
A few days ago, Congress passed a long-awaited COVID-19 emergency relief bill, as well as funding for all federal government operations. This bill awaits the President’s signature – I’ve urged him to sign this bipartisan deal as soon as possible. Here’s what’s in the relief package:
	•	$120 billion for unemployment insurance (provides an additional $300/week to supplement state and federal unemployment benefits until March 2021.)
	•	$166 billion for economic impact payments (one-time direct payments of $600 for individuals making up to $75,000 and $1,200 for couples making up to $150,000, as well as an extra $600 per eligible child dependent.)
	•	$25 billion for emergency rental assistance.
	•	$325 billion to support small business (includes $284 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and extends PPP through March 2021.)
	•	$10 billion for child care.
	•	Additional funds for FEMA, education, transportation, vaccine distribution, broadband, U.S. Postal Service, agriculture, grants for venue operators, and more. 
This bipartisan and overdue agreement is a step in the right direction to provide Americans with the help they need now. Although Secretary Mnuchin was one of the negotiators who agreed to the deal, President Trump last night suddenly threatened to veto the relief package unless direct payments were raised from $600 to $2000. So tomorrow, House Democrats will offer to pass a bill to do that. While it remains to be seen if the Senate will accept this change, I'll continue to fight for passage, and for more relief for families and small businesses as we look forward to Joe Biden taking office in January.

Holiday Safety Guidelines
According to the CDC, the safest way to celebrate the holidays is to do so at home with people who live with you. Traveling and attending gatherings with family and friends who live outside of your household increase the chances of getting or spreading COVID-19 or the flu. Click here for additional information on holiday celebrations and small gatherings.
San Diego County guidance for winter holidays also has recommendations for common activities and additional information on the regional temporary stay at home order, which remains in effect. I urge you to stay vigilant by washing your hands frequently, keeping social distance and wearing a mask to help stop this spread.

Please be aware that my office is closed from December 24th through January 1st. My staff and I look forward to responding to your inquiries until then. Thank you for your patience and understanding.

To stay up to date on my work throughout the week, you can follow me on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube.

I hope this message finds you safe and well. As always, if you have questions or concerns, please contact my office by calling (847) 413-1959, emailing me at IL08.helpline@mail.house.gov, or sending a message through my website at https://krishnamoorthi.house.gov/contact/email. 
Please Join My Tele-Town Hall Tonight
First, I’d like to encourage you to join my Tele-Town Hall this evening, from roughly 5:30pm to 6:30pm CT, to discuss the state of our response to the COVID-19 crisis as well as a range of other issues. Many of you will receive calls between 5:15pm and 5:25pm CT tonight to connect you to the event directly but you can also join at (833) 380-0623. I look forward to hearing from you and addressing your questions and concerns!
The New Bipartisan Stimulus Package We Passed Yesterday
Yesterday, after long negotiations, I joined with colleagues from both parties in the House and Senate to approve a new coronavirus stimulus package dedicated to providing much-needed support to working families, small businesses, and our efforts to defeat the virus and end the pandemic. To help working and middle-class families, the plan includes direct payments of $600 for individuals making up to $75,000 per year and $1,200 for couples making up to $150,000 per year, as well as a $600 payment for each child dependent. In total, this means that a family of four, for example, will receive $2,400.
Supporting small businesses was also a major priority for us in developing this legislation, so the package includes more than $284 billion for first and second forgivable PPP loans, including funding specifically dedicated to small businesses through community lenders. To supplement this funding, we provided additional support for Economic Injury Disaster Loans, Small Business Administration debt relief payments, and expanded SBA funding. We also allocated $15 billion toward supporting live event venues, independent movie theaters, and cultural institutions.
For the millions of Americans out of work due to the pandemic, we expanded unemployment benefits to provide an additional $300 per week for all workers receiving benefits through March 14th. Beyond expanding traditional unemployment benefits, we also extended the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program, which provides coverage to gig workers, the self-employed, and others in nontraditional employment. To extend the duration of unemployment, we also provided funding for the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) program, which provides additional weeks of federally-funded unemployment benefits for workers who exhaust their standard state benefits. 
 

 Click the image above to watch my interview on MSNBC regarding the new bipartisan stimulus package
Communities have been hit hard by this pandemic at every level, including children who have had to adapt to hybrid and remote learning. To support education and the new cost burdens this pandemic has placed on communities, we included $82 billion in funding for schools while increasing funding for childcare, broadband access, and anti-hunger programs feeding children in need. In addition, as tenants and landlords have both faced the pressures of this pandemic and Americans are struggling to pay rent, we’ve included $25 billion in rental assistance in this legislation as well.
Further, to support health care workers and communities battling the pandemic, we included $69 billion in funding for health care efforts, including testing, tracing, and vaccine distribution as well as direct support for health care providers.
This stimulus package we passed yesterday was a comprehensive piece of bipartisan legislation that includes much more than the items I’ve outlined above. Please contact my office for more information on the content of this legislation or if you have any questions on its provisions.

5/14/21 16:45,"Reopening and Recovering, Safely","May 14, 2021
 
Dear Friends,
 
It has been a pivotal week in our nation’s efforts to end the COVID-19 public health crisis and safely reopen our communities and economy. Yesterday, the CDC released exciting new guidance for fully vaccinated individuals, advising that for those who are two weeks out from having received their final dose of the vaccine, it is safe to resume many pre-pandemic activities without mask-wearing or social distancing. And on Monday, the Food and Drug Administration announced that children ages 12 to 15 can now safely be vaccinated against COVID-19 with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. The key to ending this crisis and safely getting back to our lives are the incredibly effective COVID-19 vaccines, and as of this week, more Americans than ever are eligible to get their shots.
 
Reopening our schools, rebuilding our economy, and overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic hinges on our ability to vaccinate as many Americans as possible — and this updated guidance for those fully vaccinated is a signal that the vaccines are working. 
 
  

The CDC has guidance for parents who want to know more about COVID-19 vaccinations for children 12-15.
 
Safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines offer a light at the end of the tunnel, and I encourage parents to talk to their kids about the importance of getting vaccinated so they can safely get back to being kids while protecting themselves, their loved ones, and their communities. Hope is on the horizon!
 
  
 
Reducing Clean Energy Costs
 
  

Policies to expand access to affordable, clean energy projects have never been more timely or essential.
 
On Thursday, I joined my colleague Senator Jeff Merkley to reintroduce bicameral legislation to promote the expansion of clean energy projects in New Hampshire and across the country. This bill would make clean energy more accessible by providing low-interest financing to consumers and communities that want to make clean energy investments. 

I’m proud to reintroduce the Community Energy Savings Program Act to lower the financial barrier for Americans who wish to finance energy efficient and renewable energy projects.
 
  
 
Protecting Children From Abuse and Exploitation
 
  

For children and victims who have been stuck at home with their abusers in terrifying situations day-in and day-out, the COVID-19 pandemic has been a nightmare.
 
On Wednesday, I hosted a roundtable with my fellow co-chairs of the Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence to talk about child abuse and exploitation during the COVID-19 pandemic and steps Congress can take to help protect children and prevent violence as we emerge from this public health crisis.
 
Congress can and must do more to protect our nation’s children — I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance policies that ensure children are healthy, safe, and protected from abusers.
 
  
 
Securing the Resources to End the Substance Use Crisis
 
  

In Congress, I’m working to end the substance use crisis by advancing evidence-based policies.
 
This week in an Energy and Commerce Committee Health Subcommittee hearing, I questioned U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Becerra about the HHS budget request for FY 2022.
 
As we recover and rebuild from the COVID-19 public health crisis, we must focus on addressing the rising number of drug overdose deaths and expanding access to prevention, treatment, and support for those who are struggling with substance abuse. I look forward to working with HHS as we continue our efforts to provide high-quality health care, end the opioid epidemic, and build back better from the pandemic.
 
  
 
News You Can Use
 
  

I joined Rep. Chris Pappas and Acting FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel to discuss the new federally-funded Emergency Broadband Benefit.
 
The Federal Communications Commission’s new Emergency Broadband Benefit Program launched this week to help those in need gain or maintain access to high-speed broadband during COVID-19.
 
With students learning online, telehealth appointments replacing visits to the doctor, and many Granite Staters working from home, this pandemic has made access to reliable, high-speed internet more important than ever, and the new Emergency Broadband Benefit Program can help make it more affordable for Granite Staters across New Hampshire.
 
Check to see if you’re eligible: www.getemergencybroadband.org
 
  

If you are fully vaccinated, you can resume many activities that you did before the pandemic.
 
The CDC’s new guidance for those who are fully vaccinated represents a meaningful step forward in our recovery. People two weeks out from their last COVID-19 shot can resume many activities safely without wearing a mask or physically distancing, except where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance.
 
If you haven’t received your COVID-19 vaccine yet, you can make your appointment here: https://www.vaccines.nh.gov/.
 
 
  

This week, the Food and Drug Administration announced that children ages 12 to 15 can now safely be vaccinated against COVID-19 with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
 
As always, the CDC and the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services are the best resources to turn to during the COVID-19 public health emergency. If you are sick, stay home and call your health care provider. If you live in NH and have questions about coronavirus, dial 2-1-1 or visit CDC.gov for more information.
 
To stay updated on my work in Congress and around the Granite State, as well as for important information and resources, like my page on Facebook and follow me on Twitter. 
 
With warmer weather on the way and more shots being administered into arms every day, brighter times are ahead! I hope you have a safe and fun weekend!
 
Sincerely, 
 
Annie

4/2/21 17:42,Expanding Efforts to Get Vaccines into Arms,"Expanding Efforts to Get Vaccines into Arms
We know how important it is to ramp up getting shots into arms to get through this pandemic and get to the other side of it. That is why I joined Senator Shaheen to help ensure that smaller states like New Hampshire received their fair share of vaccine funding in the year-end COVID-19 relief and government funding package.  Following this fix, New Hampshire is now set to receive an additional $30.6 million in vaccine funding.  This week, I toured a vaccine distribution site in Salem that is supported through federal funding. I was grateful to tour the site at the Mall at Rockingham Park, and have the opportunity to thank the National Guard members, the Salem Fire Department, and the many others who have stepped up to make these vaccination sites possible.  I also visited Amoskeag Health in Manchester this week, which is set to receive $3.2 million through the American Rescue Plan. I appreciated the opportunity to hear from Amoskeag Health leaders about how this additional funding that we secured will help to bolster their COVID-19 vaccination, testing, and treatment efforts, especially for underserved communities.  We are finally beginning to see a light at the end of the tunnel in this pandemic. I urge everyone to continue to wear their masks, socially distance, and get a COVID-19 vaccine when you can. This will help us get through this pandemic and save lives.   
With every good wish,     Senator Maggie Hassan 
What the Senator is Working On
This week, Senator Hassan joined her colleagues in urging the Biden administration to ensure that insurance companies are following the law and providing Granite Staters and Americans COVID-19 diagnostic tests at no cost.

5/19/21 14:54,Newsletter: Gimenez hosted his first tele-townhall,"Dear Friends,
 
Last week, I hosted my first tele-townhall since coming to Congress to recap my first 100 days representing Florida’s 26th Congressional District. At the event, I heard from a number of constituents who shared the same concerns as the folks I met as I made a swing through the district the past few weeks – we need to get government spending and inflation under control, we need to stop perpetuating a system that disincentivizes people to leave unemployment programs and return to the workforce, and something needs to be done about border security and reforming our immigration system. 
 
Since the beginning of my term, I have set out to work on these issue areas, ready and willing to work with anyone who wants to come to the table. Unfortunately, Washington continues to operate in such a hyper-partisan manner where most Members of Congress and members of the press care more about scoring political points and getting likes and retweets than actually delivering results.
 
Despite this partisan culture, I will continue to fight for the solutions that will keep pushing South Florida forward, whether it’s meeting with President Biden in the Oval Office to discuss a better way to complete an infrastructure package or reaching across the aisle to make sure we give DREAMers the legal protections they need to continue contributing to our communities.
 
I hope to continue bringing you updates from my work in Washington and having more of these tele-townhalls where I can hear, directly from you, the issues impacting South Florida. My team and I are already planning our second event next month. In the meantime, you can always reach my office with any comments, questions, or concerns by clicking here. I hope to hear from you. 

Sincerely,
 
Carlos A. Gimenez
Member of Congress



Gimenez Introduces Resolution Condemning Terrorist Acts by Hamas Against Israel



On Thursday, Congressman Carlos A. Gimenez introduced a House Resolution to condemn Hamas and reaffirm congressional support for the U.S.-Israel alliance and the Jewish people. As of today, 70 Members of Congress have co-sponsored the resolution with more expected to join over the course of the coming week.
 
In a statement issued after the resolution was introduced, Gimenez said the videos depicting hundreds of rockets being launched from Gaza into Israel, and the Israeli’s anti-missile defense system – known as the Iron Dome – intercepting those rockets, underscores the importance of American support of Israel.
 
“We are reminded of why the United States must continue being an ally of Israel and why our commitment to Israel’s sovereignty and independence is so crucial at a time of heightened regional hostility,” Gimenez said in the statement. 
 


The resolution specifically:
 
(1) condemns the acts of terrorism committed by Hamas against the people of the State of Israel;
 
(2) recognizes Jerusalem as the legitimate capital city of the State of Israel;
 
(3) supports Israel’s efforts of self-determination and collective security against external forces; and
 
(4) reaffirms support for policies and initiatives combatting anti-Semitic behavior around the world.
 
Gimenez has urged Democrats to join the resolution, saying that a common defense of Israel should not be a partisan issue.
 
“Each Member of Congress now has a decision to make. Either you stand with Israel and the Jewish people or you stand with the Hamas terrorists. Every Member should go on record regarding their position. I thank my colleagues who have stood up and declared their support of our Israeli partners by signing this resolution,” Gimenez said.

Gimenez Swings Through Monroe County

Earlier in the month, Congressman Carlos A. Gimenez visited several locations throughout the Florida Keys to hear directly from constituents the needs faced by Monroe County’s communities.


One of those events was Monroe County Mayor Michelle Coldiron’s State of The County Address at the Ocean Reef Chamber of Commerce Luncheon. In attendance were several local businesses along with Chip Iglesias, President of Ocean Reef, and Steve Hudson, newly appointed Fire Chief of Monroe County.


Gimenez also met with the Florida Department of Health in Monroe County to discuss hurricane preparedness strategies and what help the federal government can extend to Monroe County as we head into hurricane season. The Emergency Management Team also provided Gimenez with updates on Monroe County’s vaccination rates, announcing that Monroe County has now reached 50% vaccination rate among adults.


Honoring Small Business Week, Gimenez visited King’s Seafood in Marathon. The local restaurant founded in 2011 by a Cuban immigrant who arrived in 1983. Gimenez discussed with the owners the impact of Biden’s proposed corporate tax hike from 21% to 28%, as well as the ramifications faced when trying to find new workers because of the enhanced unemployment benefits.

Gimenez Honors Law Enforcement Officers on National Police Week


Last week, Congressman Carlos A. Gimenez gave a floor speech to commemorate National Police Week honoring law enforcement officers who Gimenez described as “incredible” and “work tirelessly to keep our communities safe.” 
 
In the speech, Gimenez said pointed to the fact that some Americans have lost confidence in our country’s institutions and called for the country to come together to forge a new path of unity and purpose by addressing every injustice, while acknowledging the positive actions by our police officers.
 
For this reason, Gimenez said, he co-sponsored the JUSTICE Act, introduced by Minnesota Congressman Pete Stauber, to provide needed police reform to help ensure positive, fair policing.
 
Gimenez said:
 
“The legislation helps ensure law enforcement agencies and officers are kept safe. I know firsthand the importance of body cameras, not only for accountability, but also for the safety of every law enforcement officer. As Mayor of Miami-Dade County, I was one of the first in the country to implement a program putting body cameras on our police officers. This legislation would help replicate what we did in Miami-Dade County across the country by providing $500 million for state and local law enforcement agencies to equip officers with body cameras.”
 
Gimenez also said the legislation helped improve training for officers, including provisions that bans the use of chokeholds for most situations. “This bill keeps qualified immunity for police officers and agencies intact, allowing police offers the ability to do their jobs free from threats of unjust retribution. Eliminating qualified immunity would be a disaster for our country,” Gimenez said.
 
In concluding the speech, Gimenez also announced his co-sponsorship of the David Dorn Back The Blue Act. The legislation provides pay raises for our law enforcement officials and give police departments the financial flexibility they need to hire quality talent and retain good officers.
 
“Police officers deserve to know we have their back. Their commitment to their communities, their willingness to put their lives on their lines to keep our children and grandchildren safe, must be commended and not attacked. It is time to step up and give our police the support they deserve,” Gimenez concluded.

Matt's Weekly Memo
 
  
Dear Lindsey,  Earlier this week, I asked people across Northeastern Pennsylvania to tell me if you were having issues with your mail delivery. The response has been overwhelming. I heard from over 7,000 of you, and you told me that shipments of your essential prescription medication is coming later than it should. You told me that worsening service quality is hurting your small businesses, as your products are arriving late or getting lost in transit. You told me that you're incurring late fees because your bills aren't getting where they need to go on time, and so much more. This poor level of service is unacceptable, and it has gone on for too long.
 
Yesterday, I called on President Biden to nominate qualified leaders to fill the three vacancies on the USPS Board of Governors -- leaders who will take seriously their responsibility to ensure the Postal Service delivers for Americans.
 
As for the sitting board members? Well, I encourage the President to take a hard look at their records and dismiss those who do not share the goal of promoting reliable and efficient mail service.
 
People's lives and livelihoods depend on the USPS, and that's why I'm fighting to restore it.

Relief for Hospitality & Tourism Businesses
 
  
Northeastern Pennsylvania’s restaurant and hospitality businesses are part of what makes our area so special. They are where we all come together to catch up with old friends, sample some great locally brewed beer, or celebrate special occasions, and we should make sure they can survive through to the end of this crisis.  
 
That's why several members of the Pennsylvania Congressional delegation and I urged House leadership to include provisions from the RESTAURANTS Act in the COVID-19 relief package being developed in Congress. Small and independently owned restaurants and their employees are among the hardest hit by this pandemic, and this legislation would provide aid to meet their unique needs and ensure they can survive this crisis.

5/14/21 17:24,Senator Murphy COVID-19 Weekly Update: May 14th,"Friend – 
Below please find the Murphy office update on COVID-19. 
As always, if you need assistance, please don't hesitate to contact our Hartford or Washington, D.C. offices. 
Here’s what you need to know this week: 
	•	VACCINE NEWS: Connecticut became the first state to vaccinate more than 70% of its adult population. Earlier this week, the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was approved for children ages 12-15 years old. You can click here to find out how to vaccinate your children. In addition, all adults ages 16+ are eligible to get the COVID-19 vaccine in Connecticut. Visit gov/covidvaccine to learn more and register for an appointment.
	•	Governor Lamont announced that Connecticut is lifting all COVID-19 restrictions on May 19th. Contingent upon sufficiently low rates of infections and increasing vaccination rates, remaining business restrictions will be lifted. The Department of Public Health will be issuing recommendations for indoor and other large outdoor events, such as concerts.
	•	Yesterday the CDC announced that fully vaccinated people can resume activities without wearing a mask or physically distancing, except where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance. Governor Lamont confirmed that starting on May 19th, Connecticut will no longer require fully vaccinated residents to wear a mask in most indoor and outdoor spaces.
	•	Today, Senator Murphy, joined by Governor Ned Lamont and other community leaders, held a roundtable in Torrington for a discussion on broadband and infrastructure. At the roundtable, Murphy talked about the need to pass the American Jobs Plan that helps all of Connecticut access high speed broadband.
	•	Senator Murphy and Senator Richard Blumenthal, along with Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin and members of the Hartford Police Department, held a press conference calling on Congress to pass legislation that bans ghost guns – legislation that would permanently include the core building blocks of “ghost” guns– unfinished frames and receivers –in the definition of “firearm” under federal law.
	•	Senator Murphy wrapped up the day with an economic and business development tour of South Windsor with Mayor Andrew Paterna to gather feedback that he can take back to Washington on how he can better advocate for local businesses in Connecticut.
	•	This week, the Federal Communications Commission kicked off the Emergency Broadband Benefit Program. This program will make available up to $3.2 billion worth of consumer discounts on broadband services and equipment like computers and tablets during the pandemic. Click here to find out more about the program and how to apply.
	•	Last week, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, in coordination with the White House American Rescue Plan Implementation Team and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, announced the allocation of an additional $21.6 billion under the American Rescue Plan for Emergency Rental Assistance, which will help prevent evictions and ensure basic housing security for millions of Americans impacted by the affordable housing challenges exacerbated by COVID-19. The fact sheet on the additional financial support and guidance is available here.
	•	This week, the Treasury Department also released guidance on the implementation of the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds. For reference, here are the links to the fact sheet, Interim Final Rule, and the program website. They also released a FAQ document and they will continue to update as program implementation progresses.
	•	This week, Education Secretary Cardona announced that the Department of Education had lifted the Trump Administration's ban on emergency grant aid for college students going to undocumented and international students, opening up access to these grants for all college students. Connecticut is receiving $225 million from the American Rescue Plan to support higher education, on top of funding from previous relief bills, and at least half of all funds must be used by colleges to provide emergency aid grants to students to cover housing, employment, and food insecurities. Students should ask their college's financial aid office for more information on how to access these grants. 
	•	Already vaccinated against COVID-19? Beginning May 19-31, show your vaccination card at participating restaurants and receive an alcoholic or non-alcoholic drink for free. #CTDrinksOnUs!

2/21/21 17:10,Getting Closer to More COVID Relief,"Friends,   This week, I met with New Jerseyans facing extraordinary challenges as a result of this pandemic and we talked about how President Biden’s American Rescue Plan that I’m fighting for in the Senate will provide direct relief to our families, businesses, and communities - in addition to ramping up an aggressive national vaccination plan.   Here are three things I want you to know about this legislation: 
 


ONE: Relief for Workers and Families
Beyond extending unemployment benefits, this legislation will send most Americans another $1,400 check on top of the $600 payment passed in December. For COVID-19 survivors like Shivanthi Crawford and Travis from East Orange, who are struggling to get by, this money will be a lifeline. The bill also includes real tax relief for low-income workers and their families by increasing the maximum Child Tax Credit from $2,000 to $3,000, with an additional $600 for kids under the age of six, and making the credit fully refundable. Around 27 million children, including nearly half of all Black and Latino children, live in households that currently don’t qualify for the full benefit. Expanding this tax relief and making it available to those who need it the most has the potential to lift half of the children in the U.S. out of poverty and will impact the lives of more than a half-a-million kids in New Jersey.
 
 
TWO: Keeping our Restaurants Alive
New Jersey has always been a great place to get a bite to eat, and I want it to stay that way. Unfortunately, while initial aid helped millions of small businesses, most of the COVID relief programs for small businesses passed last year failed to cater to the urgent needs of our family-owned restaurants, bars, cafes and eateries that have been hit hard by this pandemic. That’s why I’ve been pushing for months for the RESTAURANTS Act – a bill to provide direct assistance to these vital and beloved neighborhood places. Fortunately, significant pieces of this bill have been incorporated into the American Rescue Plan. We want our restaurant industry to survive this pandemic and ultimately thrive once its over, and that is what this money will help do. Listen to Sal Beradi’s story, owner of SalTown Deli in Woodland Park, who’s been fighting to keep his business alive. 
 

THREE: Saving Essential Workers
Soaring coronavirus response costs, plummeting tax revenues, and the Trump Administration’s hands-off approach to this pandemic wreaked havoc on the budgets of states and communities. This has thrown the jobs of millions of our teachers, firefighters, public health workers, law enforcement officers and other essential workers across the country into jeopardy – at a time we can least afford it. That’s why I fought to make sure the American Rescue Plan includes direct funding to our state, county and local governments, much like I proposed in the bipartisan SMART Act I introduced last year. At the end of the day, I’m hopeful we will be able to bolster New Jersey’s state government with a $6 billion infusion and a $3 billion boost to our counties and municipalities. Not only will this help keep thousands of essential New Jersey workers on the job, but our communities will also benefit from multibillion-dollar investments to protect our public transit systems and help schools reopen safely by improving ventilation, reducing class size and more. Watch me explain the American Rescue Plan in greater detail here.

4/13/21 18:05,Clyde in Congress: The Biden Administration is trying to distract from the Border Crisis,"117th Congress, 1st Session | April 13th, 2021
 


Friends,

I just got back from Texas where I witnessed first-hand the disaster at our southern border. Like many of you, I am deeply concerned about the drugs, human smuggling, and humanitarian crisis that the Biden Administration created through shoddy policies. 

What I find particularly remarkable about the border crisis is that it is entirely self-inflicted. Had the Biden Administration entered office and simply continued to implement existing policy, none of this would have happened. The Trump Administration had created policies, including the construction of the Border Wall, which were effective in preventing abnormally high illegal immigration. Now, of course, Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas is considering a restart of border wall construction and the White House is making agreements with our neighbors in Mexico and Central America encouraging them to secure their own borders. These are all policies that existed before the Biden Administration created this nightmare scenario! 

As I have said repeatedly, every state is a border state because every state, including Georgia, is impacted by the crime, drugs, and other national security risks associated with poor border security. The Biden Administration is attempting to sweep the border crisis under the rug by repackaging Trump Administration policies, but I won’t let them off the hook so easily, and I hope you won’t either.

Sincerely,
 
-- Andrew S. Clyde

The White House takes aim at the Second Amendment Rights Once Again
 

President Biden announced more executive actions against the Second Amendment last week. Specifically, he plans to try and eliminate guns that can be built at home, what they call “ghost guns” and classify stabilizing braces for pistols as subject to requirements under the National Firearms Act. This would require individuals to pay $200 fees, federally register these firearms, and disclose personally identifiable information to the ATF. 

What concerns me the most is his plan to establish a “red flag” law to control who can and cannot own a firearm. As your Representative, I want to be clear: I will not give one inch in the fight to protect our right to keep and bear arms!  I wholeheartedly believe we must do our best to curtail the criminal misuse of firearms, but we must do so without treading on our inalienable Second Amendment rights. Unfortunately, these executive orders miss the mark when it comes to our shared goal of ensuring responsible firearm use in America. It is for this reason, among others, that I have made defending the Second Amendment a primary focal point of my legislative agenda, and you can count on me to continue opposing this dangerous ploy to strip our Constitutional rights. 

 

Biden Administration Proposes Tax Hikes to Pay for its Plump “Infrastructure” Plan

Recently, President Joe Biden released his $2.25 trillion “infrastructure” plan, which would absolutely kill good paying jobs by raising taxes on American businesses. This massive spending plan will pump money into Green New Deal initiatives, with only a fraction going to actual infrastructure improvements.

Some of the non-infrastructure related spending included in the Biden Administration plan is $400 billion to expand and support home health care and $35 billion to pay for a set of vague climate initiatives. How does that have anything to do with real infrastructure? 

With any spending plan, there must be a way to pay for it. To do so, President Biden is calling for a hike in corporate tax rates from 21 to 28 percent and an increase in taxation on the profits U.S. corporations earn overseas, raising the rate from 13 percent to 21 percent. Additionally, the President is seeking increased funding for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in order to increase audits on corporations. These increased tax rates will slow the growth of American companies, and cause many to leave the country. This, in turn, would eliminate nearly 159,000 jobs and reduce wages by 0.7 percent. I will staunchly oppose this tax increase scheme.
 

No Taxpayer Money for 'Vaccine Passports'

While the Biden Administration appears to be taking a step back on federally mandating Vaccine Passports for Americans, it looks like the private sector may be preparing to take on this initiative itself. According to the President's Press Secretary, Jen Psaki, the Biden administration is focused on creating guidelines that can be used by the private sector. 
 
As you may know, a vaccine passport is certified documentation proving that the individual seeking to travel has been vaccinated against the Coronavirus (COVID-19) or has recently received a negative COVID-19 test result. President Biden’s chief medical adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said last Monday that the federal government will not mandate passports that show proof of a COVID-19 vaccination. Fauci did say that he believes private entities, including theaters and universities, may take action to mandate vaccinations on their own terms. 
 
Like any concerned citizen, I want to ensure the health and safety of Americans through reasonable safeguards, but I do not support enacting government mandates as they relate to an individuals’ personal health decisions. Accordingly, I not only joined several of my Republican colleagues in sending a letter to President Biden expressing shared concerns regarding data privacy and travel restrictions that would likely ensue should such a passport system be implemented, I also added my name to Rep. Matthew Rosendale’s (R-MT) “No Taxpayer Funding for Vaccine Passports Act,” a bill to prohibit federal funds from being used to implement, enforce, or assist in the establishment of a COVID–19 vaccine passport system.
 
To that end, I continue to support the state of Georgia’s work in delivering and administering the COVID-19 vaccine to communities across the state so that those who are eligible and willing to be vaccinated have access to it. For more information regarding vaccine administration and distribution in Georgia, please visit the Georgia Department of Public Health's webpage here.  
 

Week Ahead
 

Lawmakers return to Washington, D.C. this week and the House is expected to take up more progressive measures that are marketed as efforts to improve the workplace – H.R. 7, the “Paycheck Fairness Act” and H.R. 1195, the “Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act.” Together, these bills would not only tie the hands of employers but would also expose them to frivolous lawsuits and costly bureaucratic red tape. 

 H.R. 7 seeks to prevent sex-based wage discrimination in the workplace by closing the “wage-gap.” While my democratic colleagues believe that employers have found loopholes that allow them to avoid responsibility for discriminatory pay for too long, and in doing so have created a “wage gap” between men and women, nothing could be further from the truth. Every business owner or employer knows that sex-based wage discrimination is already illegal under both the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Moreover, the wage gap my democratic colleagues like to point to in their support for H.R. 7 is not a measure of equal pay for equal work. In fact, when we adjust the gap for factors such as hours worked, compensation packages, and benefits, the gap is basically nonexistent. When Democrats talk about equal pay they’re really talking about doing away with choices – choices made and enjoyed by employers and workers alike – and so I plan to protect those choices by opposing H.R. 7 when it comes to the floor for a vote. 

In addition, Speaker Pelosi is planning to bring up H.R. 1195, a bill to require healthcare and social service employers to implement workplace violence prevention plans. While workers in these environments may be at a higher risk for sustaining workplace injuries inflicted by others while on the job, the bill itself actually instructs the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the federal agency charged with ensuring workplace safety, to undertake an expedited rulemaking process that would prohibit public and subject matter input from being considered as the agency crafts the federal mandate. Moreover, the Congressional Budget office found that the bill last Congress, which passed the House by a vote of 251-158, would cost private entities at least $2.7 billion to comply in the first year alone! Given the financial stress many of our hospitals are facing as the nation continues to battle the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with the hasty creation of such a costly mandate, you can expect me to oppose this bill as well.

2/12/21 18:31,On the Record with Congresswoman Hinson: An Update from Ashley on IA-01,"IA-01 Update From Congresswoman Hinson

Friend, 

Thank you for signing up for my e-newsletter, where you can stay up to date on all of my work for Iowa's First District in Congress! 

While it has been an unprecedented start to this year in Washington, I've been putting my head down and getting straight to work for Iowa's First District. I am excited to be serving Iowans on both the House Appropriations Committee and the House Budget Committee where I will fight for priorities that matter to Iowans and rural America, ensure taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly, push back on Democrats’ liberal agenda, and bring some desperately needed transparency to government spending. 

So far, I have introduced two bills, the Reopen Schools Act, which will help students get back in the classroom safely, and the Vaccinate Americans, Not Terrorists Act, which will prevent the federal government from sending vaccines to Guantanamo Bay while American citizens still have outstanding requests for the vaccine. 

Additionally, I've co-sponsored 48 pieces of legislation--including bills to protect the unborn, better use taxpayer resources, and ensure our veterans get the care they deserve.

This week, I was back home in Iowa traveling through the district and hearing directly from constituents, organizations, and businesses about how I can best serve them in Washington. From meeting with law enforcement in Jones County to touring the shop floor at Kinze Manufacturing in Williamsburg, and discussing COVID-19 vaccine distribution at Crescent Community Health Center in Dubuque--I left every meeting with a to-do list or legislative idea I will bring back to Washington. 

I also wanted to provide an update on the COVID-19 vaccine in Iowa. I've heard from many of you who are concerned about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine and Iowa lagging behind -- I'm worried about this, too. My team and I have been in constant communication with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Biden Administration, and Governor Reynolds's office to ensure Iowans have access to more doses of the vaccine and are not left behind. This week, I led the entire Iowa House Delegation in urging the Biden Administration to partner with Iowa's federally qualified community health centers to administer the vaccine to more Iowans as soon as possible. I will keep you updated on these efforts and will continue working around the clock to address issues Iowans are facing in receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. 

Below, I've included some additional updates from my time as your representative as well as a survey about the legislative priorities you'd like me to work on in Congress on your behalf. Thank you for sending me to Washington, it is an honor to represent you and your families in Congress! 

Best,

2/6/21 10:01,Weekly Update: COVID Relief Legislation Should Be Bipartisan,"Weekly Update | February 6, 2021


COVID Relief Legislation Should Be Bipartisan

President Biden campaigned on bipartisanship and pledged to lead the country in a unifying way. This latest round of discussions on additional COVID-19 relief will be the president’s first major opportunity to show the American people if he was telling the truth about how he would lead and govern. I know we will have policy disagreements on how to get the country through this pandemic, but as a conservative committed to governing, I believe both parties have an obligation to our constituents to work together and find common ground.

That is why I, and a group of Republican colleagues in the House, sent a letter to President Biden this week urging him to reject efforts to pass a Democrat-only COVID-19 relief plan, and pursue a bipartisan agreement. 

Part of our letter stated, “Bipartisanship is not only essential to delivering an effective response to the pandemic, but to demonstrating our shared commitment to unifying the American people and forging the pathway forward together. With this in mind, we urge your Administration to work with leaders and Members of both parties to advance a bipartisan COVID-19 relief package comprised of consensus-driven policies.” 

Since March, Congress has enacted five bipartisan COVID-19 relief packages developed with bipartisan, bicameral cooperation. Despite strong support now on both sides of the aisle for an additional pandemic relief package that includes funds to strengthen national vaccination and testing programs, immediate assistance to individuals and families, and expanded support for struggling businesses, Democratic Leaders in Congress have signaled they intend to forgo meaningful bipartisan negotiations, resorting instead to the partisan budget reconciliation process. This tool allows spending legislation, such as COVID-19 relief, to be enacted without bipartisan support. 

You can read the full letter here.

Meeting with National Guard Leaders


Pictured above: Rodney greets members of the National Guard from Illinois

This week, I met with leaders of the National Guard providing support to the U.S. Capitol Police, including Major General William Walker, Commanding General for the District Columbia of National Guard, Brigadier General John Driscoll, Task Force Capitol Grounds Commander, and other members of the National Guard.

As last month's events remain fresh on the minds of members, staff, and the American people, we are so grateful to have members of the National Guard assisting the United States Capitol Police continue to secure the Capitol complex. We know the National Guard was ready to immediately assist as rioters approached the Capitol on January 6th, but there was a clear breakdown in the approval process. This failure is just one of the reasons I've called for immediate public hearings to address security operations and for Congress to establish a 9/11-style commission to prevent this from ever happening again. We must understand where the breakdown happened, take steps so this never happens again, and hold anyone responsible for this delay accountable.


Pictured above: Rodney discusses the National Guard security posture on Capitol Hill with Major General Walker and Brigadier General John Driscoll.



Expanding Registered Apprenticeship Programs

This week, I voted in support of the National Apprenticeship Act, which seeks to create nearly 1 million additional apprenticeship opportunities over the next five years.

Registered Apprenticeships are a successful, proven federal workforce training program that creates new, good-paying jobs. That is why I proudly voted in support of this bill. This bipartisan legislation will create nearly 1 million new apprenticeships over the coming years and will offer out-of-work Americans new job opportunities in this struggling economy. We should be doing everything we can to get our economy going again, and that starts by building on what works and enacting job-creating policies.

You can learn more about this legislation here. 


Grant Awarded to Heritage Behavior Health Center in Decatur

This week, our office announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded a $4,000,000 Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) Expansion Grant to Heritage Behavior Health Center in Decatur. The grant will enable them to become a federally designated CCBHC allowing them to expand their services to integrate primary care alongside critical behavioral health services.

I congratulate Heritage Behavior Health Center on receiving this multi-million dollar federal grant that will allow them to expand their already wide-array of services to the community. It will ensure that those who need access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment will be able to receive it alongside primary health care services. This is a great example of the kind of investments the federal government is making to improve access to care and I’m proud to support it. I've visited Heritage multiple times during my time in Congress and know that they'll put the funding to good use for Decatur and the surrounding communities.

You can learn more about this grant here. 


Remembering the Life of Rosemarie Long


I was saddened to learn of the passing of my good friend Rosemarie Long, leader of the Sangamon County Republicans, this week. Rose was a mentor to me and so many others in Sangamon County. She cared deeply about her community and will be sorely missed. I cannot believe she is gone. May God continue to bless her family at this sorrowful time.

12/28/20 16:14,FINALLY! Help is on the way.,"Dear Friend,   For the past nine months, the coronavirus has roiled our communities -- claiming the lives of over 300,000 Americans, sickening over 8 million more, closing countless businesses, and costing tens of millions of people their jobs.   I’ve heard from working families who are struggling to keep food on the table for their families. From teachers who are doing everything they can, with too few resources, to teach their students remotely. From frontline health care workers who don’t have access to the personal protective equipment (PPE) they need to stay safe. From rural Oregonians who worry about local budget squeezes that could result in layoffs to firefighters and teachers. And from business owners who are fighting to stay afloat.   Like so many Oregonians, and Americans across the country, I am relieved that Congress finally acted by passing a fourth, $900 billion coronavirus relief package -- meaning critically needed assistance is now on its way to our state. That relief will include $284 billion for business loans through the Paycheck Protection Program; $600 per person direct payments for Oregonians with incomes below $75,000 for an individual or $150,000 for a household; a boost in supplemental federal unemployment benefits of $300 for the next 11 weeks; and a continuation of the special unemployment benefits for gig workers and people who are self-employed. The bill also includes $82 billion for colleges and schools; $7 billion for rural broadband; $13 billion for food assistance programs Americans rely on to feed their families; and, for the first time, $25 billion in rental assistance funding that will help people keep roofs over their heads. It also will deliver much needed funding to speed vaccine distribution so we can put this pandemic behind us as soon as possible.   I will be following up with you shortly with more information about how to access these resources. I also hope you will bookmark my coronavirus webpage --Merkley.Senate.Gov/Coronavirus -- which my team and I are working to update now with the most up-to-date information and links.   While these are important provisions to help people right now, it’s way too late and not nearly enough. Like so many people, I’ve been beyond frustrated by a Senate majority that has spent the last 8 months refusing to come to the table to negotiate another coronavirus relief package. I continually pushed congressional leaders and the Trump administration to deliver on everything from Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program funding and broadband access for rural and tribal communities, to protections from utility shut offs, and more. I also kept a steady drumbeat on the need to cancel the Senate’s summer recess and bring the HEROES Act -- which was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives seven months ago and would have delivered far more relief than this week’s bill -- to the Senate floor for a vote, which the Senate majority refused to do. That kind of inaction in the face of extreme suffering across our nation is completely unacceptable.   Please know that I’m going to continue pushing for more relief so that families have the resources they need to get to the other side of this crisis, and then to thrive. I hope you will join me in doing your part, too, by staying vigilant, wearing a mask, and limiting your contact with others, especially indoors. If we keep working together, we’re going to get through this together, so let’s do everything we can to recommit to this fight.   All my best,  Jeff

Immediately, the two officers sprang into action to protect the innocent people around them. Because of their quick action, the shooter was neutralized and lives were saved.
Their heroic actions on that day earned them the Congressional Badge of Bravery - an honor that recognizes exceptional acts of bravery in the line of duty by federal, state, and local law enforcement officers.
I was honored to present this award to now Chief Miller and Corporal Lingo at a ceremony this week in Fayette County. Chief Miller and Corporal Lingo represent the very best of our commonwealth. They both put on the uniform every day knowing the risks. I was honored to present them with the Congressional Badge of Bravery this week, a token of gratitude for their selfless and courageous actions.

Protecting Children from 
Online Predators
While the internet has created all sorts of wonderful innovations, it has also created terrible opportunities for predators to stalk and harm people - especially kids. The Zezzo family of Bucks County experienced this firsthand when their then-teenaged daughter was cyber-stalked by a friend's father on social media. The stalker pleaded guilty only to a misdemeanor stalking charge and was sentenced to probation and counseling. Three years later, the same stalker began making contact again and was arrested by local police. He was sentenced to between 18 months and seven years in a state prison.
In response, Senator Casey, Representative Fitzpatrick, and I introduced the Combat Online Predators Act which enhances criminal penalties for stalkers under federal law by up to five years if the victim is a minor. The Combat Online Predators Act was signed into law on December 22, 2020.
This week, I joined my colleagues for a conversation in Philadelphia exploring the issue of online safety for children and safeguards against cyber stalkers. During this conversation, we presented the Zezzo family with a signed copy of the legislation.


Discussing Infrastructure 
in Pittsburgh
This week, I hosted a forum with Pittsburgh Works, an organization made up of union leaders and officials from the manufacturing, steel, and energy sectors. During this forum, I provided an update on what I've been working on in Washington, especially as it relates to infrastructure, but I was mostly interested in hearing from the attendees. Attendees discussed U.S. Steel's decision last week to cancel a $1.2 billion Mon Valley Works project. They expressed concern about this decision, and it is certainly something I plan on following up about with the company.
Attendees also touched on the need to focus on our aging roads and bridges, something I am pushing for in the Republican infrastructure package. Read more about the forum in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and the Pittsburgh Tribune Review.


More Vaccine Opportunities for Central Pennsylvania 
The best way to get society back to normal as quickly as possible is by getting the COVID-19 vaccination. With this in mind, Penn State University announced last week that it is offering either the Johnson & Johnson or Moderna vaccines to the local community at the Bryce Jordan Center at Penn State University Park in Centre County.
The vaccination site's hours of operations are as follows:  
	•	Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays from noon to 8 p.m.
	•	Saturdays and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
This vaccination site is open to all individuals 18 and up, regardless of county of residence, including students from out of state. Individuals can make an appointment online or by calling 1-844-545-3450. Appointments are encouraged, but not required.

STANDING UP FOR OUR VETERANS 

WATCH: Meijer, Slotkin discuss burn pits legislation

LANSING, Mich. - U.S. Representatives Peter Meijer and Elissa Slotkin discussed on Wednesday afternoon new legislation being proposed to address burn pits. The Veterans Burn Pits Recognition Act, which was introduced earlier this month, seeks to...

Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI) and I recently introduced a bill to address veteran burn pit exposure. Our legislation, the Veterans Burn Pit Recognition Act, would formally recognize that veterans who served near open-air burn pits in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other places were exposed to airborne hazards and toxins and take the burden of proof off the veteran, requiring the V.A. to perform a medical examination to determine if exposure is linked to a veteran’s particular ailment. Having served in Iraq, this is personal to me. We have a moral obligation to take care of the men and women who have served and sacrificed to defend our nation. Read more here. 

WEEKEND VISITS RECAP





﻿I participated in the Middleville Lofts Ribbon Cutting ceremony. Increasing housing options in MI-03 will attract more people to live and work in West Michigan. I’m thankful for all the work the Michigan Economic Development Corporation has done, and I look forward to my next visit 









I had the opportunity to tour the Inner City Christian Federation (ICCF) in Grand Rapids. ICCF plays an integral role in helping individuals in our community access resources such as housing counseling and financial classes.  







﻿I also stopped by the Battle Creek YMCA vaccination site. This site is allowing walk-in appointments for individuals 16 years and older. I was extremely impressed by their operation, and I encourage all those who want the vaccine to sign up for an appointment. 







﻿
﻿I visited The Right Place in Grand Rapids. They are doing amazing work to help grow our economy and support small businesses and workers.

12/24/20 14:21,My End of Year Wrap-Up,"Some Thoughts As The Year Comes to a Close
As we near the end of 2020, which has been so hard for so many, I want to take a moment to thank you, and all of Minnesota.
It is my great honor to represent you in Washington D.C., and to do whatever I can in the United States Senate to make progress for people.  I'll be honest, this can be a frustrating place, and progress comes slow.  But progress comes, sometimes because of what we accomplish in the Senate, and often because of what you do.
In the midst of this global pandemic, which has shaken the foundations of our health and well being, my priorities have been Minnesota's priorities - getting direct help to families, small businesses, and our health care system.  As I write this, we are close to passing a $900B bipartisan COVID emergency relief bill, which will provide much needed and long overdue relief to Minnesotans.  In the midst of the dark days of this pandemic, this legislation is an economic and health bridge for Minnesota and all Americans, and it is desperately needed.
I'm glad this bill includes several of the provisions that I led or co-sponsored to make it easier to access coronavirus testing and to support vaccine distribution. We expanded tele-health, including for mental health treatment, which has been a growing need during the isolation and economic challenge of the pandemic.  We've increased support for food programs, as millions of Americans struggle to feed their families, and we are helping farmers, including small food producers to grow our food.  We're providing much-needed rental assistance, for the millions of families that have fallen behind on payments because they lost their jobs.  We're providing additional payments of $600 to about 2.5 million Minnesotans to help spur the economy. Finally, we're authorizing another round of relief for small businesses that have suffered during the current crisis.  
This bill is far from perfect.  I'm very disappointed this legislation does not provide desperately needed help to local, state and Tribal governments, which face deep budget challenges through no fault of their own because of the historic economic downturn caused by COVID.  Collectively, over 1.3 million Americans working in the public sector have lost their jobs due to budget challenges.  This must be a priority when we return in the new year.
COVID-19 has laid bare the inequities in our county, and hit hardest our elders, front line workers, and black, brown and native people, and all people of color.  This bill does not go nearly far enough to address the catastrophic challenges that many folks are experiencing right now paying rent, buying food, and caring for their children.  These challenges unite Minnesotans in rural, suburban and city communities, and we need to come together to solve them.
Yes we have challenges, but we've also seen some remarkable achievements this past year.  It is verging on miraculous that in ten months we developed COVID vaccines that are safe and effective.  Inoculations have begun, starting first with health care workers and those living in nursing homes and assisted living facilities.  This successful effort is a huge tribute to the scientists, researchers, health care professionals, and thousands of volunteers who participated in vaccine trials.  The path back to economic health is through public health, and now we have vaccines to make that happen.
I've also seen so many Minnesotans step up to help each other.  Small businesses shifted their manufacturing overnight to make personal protective equipment and hand sanitizer.  People stepped in to make sure their elder neighbors had their groceries and medicine if it wasn't safe for them to go out.  And millions of us are wearing masks, staying home, and helping to suppress the virus.  We've seen our divisions play out on TV, but we've also seen our humanity.
There also have been moments of pure joy this year, even in the midst of so much suffering.  I hope it's been the same for you.  Archie and I became grandparents for the first time.  And yes, I'm the grandma showing everyone pictures of baby Ari eating his first solid food!  I haven't seen my Dad Harlan since July. Dad is 90, but he's doing well, except for the rodents who keep chewing on the electrical wires in his truck.  If anyone has any ideas for what to do about this, let me know!  Our children are hanging in there in this strange and difficult year.  Mason and Julia have done an amazing job being new parents during a global pandemic.  Sam and Emily are doing well also, though I know Emily misses her parents in Nebraska.  There have been been lots of backyard fires and the family text chain is very active most days.  I've been here in Washington for about month, and I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to getting home to Minnesota, and my family.
Peace be with you all this holiday season.

A Message from Mike Garcia
 
  
Dear ,

One of my top priorities as your representative in Congress is making sure that our community, state, and nation remain prosperous and secure. That is why in Congress I am working on lowering taxes, strengthening our national security, and improving economic opportunities in our community. I am constantly fighting to ensure that California’s failed policies, like AB5 and our sky-high taxes, do not get uploaded to the federal level. Over the past year, I have also been pushing local and state government officials to reopen our community. I’ve had the pleasure to meet with many local community members and visit local businesses, schools, and health care centers to learn what I can do to help as they are finally allowed to reopen their doors. It has been great to see the long-overdue return to some form of normalcy.


HOLDING TOWN HALLS

In March, I had the pleasure of speaking to many of you during my series of three tele-town halls. Thank you to everyone who joined me and shared your thoughtful questions. I am committed to ensuring that everyone who shared a question during the town hall receives an answer from me. I have already provided responses to over 90 percent of the questions asked and I am in the process of responding to the final few questions. Town halls are a great way for me to provide you an update on what I am doing in Congress, but more importantly, they are a great way for me to hear the issues you are facing in our community. I plan to hold more town halls and look forward to continuing to learn from you what I can better do to serve you in Congress. I will be sure to update my town hall page with upcoming town hall events as they are announced. 

And please don’t forget, if you ever have a question or a concern for me you do not have to wait for a town hall to ask – just give my office a call.

BRINGING ACTING AIR FORCE SECRETARY TO CA-25

At the end of March, I brought the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Airforce, John Roth, to Plant 42 in the Antelope Valley. Plant 42 is a large job provider in California’s 25th District and plays a significant role in our nation’s defense. The work being done at Plant 42 helps advance and improve our military’s presence and strength in both air and space. 

  
 
  
Rep. Mike Garcia with Acting U.S. Air Force Secretary John Roth.

I am glad that Acting U.S. Air Force Secretary Roth was able to see the important work done at Plant 42. I remain committed to ensuring that the programs at Plant 42 remain fully funded and that we can provide the needed infrastructure modifications to keep the plant running smoothly.

SUPPORTING OUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS

As we continue to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, it is imperative that our health care providers receive the support and resources they need.

At the end of March, I toured the vaccination clinic at Henry Mayo Newhall Hospital and was able to learn about their critical vaccine distribution process. It was great to hear that the clinic can administer about 600 doses of the vaccine daily, and from December to March had inoculated more than 27,000 community members.

I’m grateful to all the medical professionals and staff at the clinic who tirelessly work to provide critical care to our community members.

REOPENING OUR SCHOOLS

One of the schools I visited was Madera Elementary School where I had a great discussion with the Simi Valley Unified School District’s Superintendent.

BRINGING BACK BUSINESS

As a former small business owner, it has been especially hard to watch all our small business owners suffer during the lockdowns. It has been heartwarming to finally see our businesses reopen and welcome the community back through their doors. I’ve had the pleasure of meeting with many local businesses, and it has been good to hear how they are doing and how I can better serve them in Congress as they recover and reopen.

I want to thank all the local business owners who have opened their doors to me and shared their story – from Lemon Leaf to Bravery Brewery, which became a nationwide story when a Public Health Director was caught celebrating temporarily shutting them down in February 2021. It was great to meet with these hardworking Californians and learn how they will continue to serve their local community.

After a stressful year in lockdowns, it’s important that our community not only get back to work but have a little fun. I was honored to attend the ribbon-cutting ceremony of the Cube Ice Rink in Santa Clarita. It will be a great place for the community to come together for families and sports combined.

Six Flags Magic Mountain also just recently reopened. I was able to tour Six Flags and see how they are handling reopening after a year of being shut down.  Magic Mountain is a big job provider for our community and it’s great having them back in business. We are on the road to recovery.

DEMANDING ACTION FOR OUR VETERANS AND THEIR FAMILIES

As a former Navy Fighter Pilot, I am adamant about ensuring that our veterans receive the services and support they deserve. It recently came to my attention that the National Personnel Records Center (NPRC) has an unacceptable backlog of approximately 480,000 record requests from veterans and their families. I joined a bipartisan group of 185 lawmakers in sending a letter to President Joe Biden and the Director of the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) urging them to swiftly act to address these growing backlogs of veteran claims. 

Another issue our veterans face amidst the pandemic is the need to access the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)’s telehealth services. Many communications providers waived data costs for veterans so that they can freely access VA’s telehealth service, VA Video Connect. Unfortunately, California’s net neutrality law is hindering California veterans’ free access. I sent a letter to California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) urging them to refrain from fully enforcing the net neutrality law and exempt the VA’s Video Connect program from data caps. We must ensure veterans can receive the services and support they earned. 

READ: Garcia Urges California Public Utilities Commission To Not Enforce Net Neutrality Law


COMBATING THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC

The Opioid Epidemic has devastated communities across our great state and nation, including our community. We must do all we can to combat this deadly epidemic. Currently, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) can combat all “fentanyl-related substances,” but their temporary ability to do this is set to expire on May 6. Therefore, I cosponsored the Stopping Overdoses of Fentanyl Analogues (SOFA) Act, which would make the DEA’s temporary tool permanent. I hope that Congress will swiftly pass this bill into law so that we can continue to work to combat the opioid epidemic and properly protect our communities from deadly fentanyl-related substances. 

READ: Mike Garcia Urges Congress To Act To Combat Deadly Opioid Epidemic


HELP WITH A FEDERAL AGENCY

As always, one of my top priorities as your Congressman is being available to help you with any issues that you have with a federal agency. Since May, my office has helped over 900 constituents with casework and recovered over $500,000 in aid.

5/16/21 22:09,Weekly Wrap Up,"Dear Neighbor,
  
It has been another eventful week across our country and in our community, and I am glad to send another weekly wrap up.
  

  
Before returning to Washington this week, I hosted a Restaurant Revitalization Fund webinar with our local SBA office to answer questions from local restaurant owners about assistance available to them through the American Rescue Plan.  And I stopped by the Houston VA Medical Center to thank and serve breakfast to the doctors, nurses, and staff who serve veterans in our community with AFGE Local 1633.  
 
Please note, if you are a veteran, the spouse or caregiver of a veteran, or a recipient of the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) benefits, the Houston VA Medical Center is offering COVID-19 vaccines on a walk-in basis.  
  

  
This week Houston VAMC Chief Nurse Executive Kelly Irving, MSN, RN—pictured above in red—was recognized by Department of Veterans Affairs with the Secretary’s Award for Excellence in Nursing and Advancement of Nursing Programs for her leadership through the pandemic!
  

  

  
As we talk infrastructure in Washington, I was glad to lead a bipartisan coalition of my Texas colleagues in a letter to the leaders of the Transportation and Infrastructure (T&I) Committee about creating a dedicated fund for coastal resiliency projects—like the Texas Coastal Spine—in the American Jobs Plan. 

Through the American Jobs Plan, we have the opportunity to reimagine and rebuild—investing in the future of our country by investing in our infrastructure.  For our region, that means investing in infrastructure that is resilient to floods, storms, and other threats.  Securing funding for coastal resiliency projects like the Texas Coastal Spine in the American Jobs Plan would be an innovative and important part of our path forward.  You can read the full letter here. 
 
I also joined many Texas colleagues and others as a cosponsor of the I am Vanessa Guillen Act this week, honoring her memory by changing how the military responds to cases of sexual harassment by moving prosecution decisions of sexual assault and sexual harassment cases out of the chain of command. 
  

  
The House of Representatives passed several important bills this week, with a focus on mental health and veteran support.  After debate, we passed the Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act on Thursday to provide protections for consumers, small businesses, servicemembers, and students and holds abusive debt collectors accountable.  We passed the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, which protects pregnant women from being denied employment opportunities or retaliated against for requesting reasonable accommodations, on Friday. 
 
In addition to these bills, the House passed the following bills with overwhelming bipartisan support:
	•	Family Support Services for Addiction Act of 2021 to support local nonprofit organizations in their efforts to provide affordable and accessible addiction treatment services in their communities.   
	•	Pursuing Equity in Mental Health Act to expand mental health services in high-poverty areas and provide funds for health disparities research.
	•	PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act to create canine work-therapy programs and give veterans access to service dogs to help them overcome post-traumatic stress. 
	•	Helping Emergency Responders Overcome (HERO) Act to support the mental well-being of our nation’s first responders by improving the detection, prevention, and treatment of mental health issues among firefighters, paramedics and other public safety officers.
	•	Campaign to Prevent Suicide Act to direct federal agencies to carry out a national campaign to inform the public about 9-8-8, the new number for the National Mental Health Crisis Suicide Prevention Hotline, which will go into effect in July 2022.
	•	Mental Health Services for Students Act of 2021 to fund competitive grants so that schools can greatly expand the availability of mental health services available for students, teachers, and school personnel across the country.
	•	Protecting Moms Who Served Act to eliminate maternal mortality, morbidity, and disparities among veterans through maternal care coordination programs at the Department of Veteran’s Affairs.
 
You can view my full voting record on my website (click here).
  

  
This week, the Energy and Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Health held a hearing with Secretary of Health and Human Services Xavier Becerra, where we discussed the Biden administration’s budget request and priorities.  I asked about the administration’s plans to restore Title X funding for health centers that provide essential health care for millions of low-income women across the country.  Did you know?  The Title X family planning program was introduced in Congress by President George H. W. Bush when he was the congressman for our district?  Title X is the only federal program dedicated to family planning and provides critical preventive health care services for millions of low-income Americans each year.
 
You can watch my question to the Secretary here and you can watch the full hearing here.
  

  
Next Monday, May 24, at 6:00pm, I will host a virtual Community Conversation with State Representative Jon Rosenthal (HD-135) to discuss the first 100 days in the Texas Legislature and in the House of Representatives and the matters of importance for TX-07 and HD-135.  To RSVP, click here.  I hope you’ll join!
  

  

  
This week brought welcome developments in the fight against the coronavirus.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that Americans who are fully vaccinated no longer need to wear masks—with several important exceptions, including exceptions required by federal, state, and local laws and those established by private businesses.  Another important development this week: 12 to 15 year-olds became eligible for the Pfizer vaccine.  Anyone age 12 and older can get the Pfizer vaccine at NRG Park from noon to 7:00pm Tuesdays through Sundays.  U.S. cases of the virus are currently at their lowest rate since September of 2020, and our positivity rate across the country is at its lowest since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
 
This is real progress, and our community has much to be proud of.  To keep up this progress, we should keep up our efforts—and continue to get vaccinated and follow the guidance of our public health officials.
 
I’ll be in Washington again this week, and look forward to reporting back to you next week.  I am proud to represent you, and I am here to help you.  Please do not hesitate to call me to share your thoughts and concerns or to let me know how my team and I can help.  You can email here, or call my office at (713) 353-8680 or (202) 225-2571 any time.
 
Best wishes,

2/12/21 13:31,Fighting For Working Families,"FIGHTING FOR WORKING FAMILIES

I’m excited to share with you that this week, I was selected as Republican Leader on the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) on the House Education and Labor Committee for the 117th Congress! Prior to serving in Congress, I spent about 40 years building and operating a small business, so I know firsthand how federal policies impact employers and employees.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic hit we had the greatest economy in the world, and I am laser-focused on ensuring we can rebuild to pre-pandemic levels by giving American workers the opportunity to secure a good-paying job, provide for their families and save for retirement, while protecting employer-sponsored benefits like health care. As Republican Leader, I look forward to working with members of the HELP subcommittee to fight against bureaucratic overreach that too often obstructs employers' ability to create jobs and hurts working families.



I also look forward to continuing to serve on the K-12 subcommittee as an advocate for working families who are desperate for schools to safely reopen and access to more school choice, whether that’s through a traditional education or technical education. Through my work on both of these subcommittees, I will continue to support policies that help every American on the path toward achieving the American Dream.

While this week was originally scheduled as a district work week, House Democrat leadership on the House Education and Labor Committee called a full meeting where we marked up their costly, partisan budget scheme. Instead of spending time in our districts meeting directly with families, schools and small businesses who have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Democrats advanced their $1.9 trillion “relief” bill that is full of top-down mandates unrelated to the pandemic, like a $15 federal minimum wage requirement.



I opposed their partisan reconciliation scheme and pointed out how the American Dream will not exist for the 1.4 million people who will lose their jobs due to a radical $15 national minimum wage hike like President Joe Biden and the Democrats are pushing.

Additionally, my Democrat colleagues on the committee blocked 5 common-sense amendments related to school reopenings, including mine that would require schools to at least offer families the option to receive in-person instruction in order to receive additional stimulus funds. I will continue fighting for working families and serve as a voice for students around the nation who are eager to return to the classroom!




ICYMI: This week I published in opinion piece in The Augusta Chronicle explaining that while I’m eager to work with my colleagues on reasonable legislation to restore election integrity, H.R. 1 (aka House Democrats’ #1 legislative priority) is a shameless attempt to keep one party in power through a federal takeover of our election process. You can read the full text here.

Lock and Dam Update 



This week I met with local stakeholders in the CSRA to discuss the ongoing situation with the New Savannah Bluff Lock and Dam and discussed the cities’ plans to develop a solution that works for communities on both sides of the river. I’m hopeful we can come to an agreement that maintains the pool at the level required by law.

Meeting with the National Federation of the Blind of Georgia



It was great to meet virtually with members to discuss their ongoing priorities, including economic opportunity, accessible medical devices, accessible websites, and civil rights for individuals who are blind.

ITC Investigation Regarding Foreign Blueberry Imports

Like so many of America’s fruits and vegetables, our domestic blueberry industry has been devastated by a surge in foreign imports – resulting in the lowest blueberry prices in years, thousands of workers across the country being laid off, and many growers shutting down business. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to end reliance on foreign imports for essentials, including our nation’s food supply.

This week, the U.S. International Trade Commission’s (USITC) released a determination in the global safeguard investigation into imports of fresh, chilled or frozen blueberries – an investigation I supported as a member of the House Agriculture Committee. I am disappointed and disagree with the ITC’s determination that imports do not seriously injure U.S. industry and hope we can find a way to urgently help our blueberry growers who are very clearly suffering from the severe consequences of the increase in foreign imports.

GA-12 COVID-19 Vaccine Locations

Starting today, more than 1,000 Walmart and Sam’s Club pharmacies in 22 states, including 11 in Georgia’s 12th district, will begin administering COVID-19 vaccines. Eligible customers can schedule a vaccine appointment directly via the Walmart and Sam’s Club (membership not required) websites once appointments are available, making it convenient to get vaccinated while allocation lasts.

Every American deserves affordable, quality health care coverage and no one should be forced to pay more due to a pre-existing condition that is out of their control.

That’s why I’m proud to cosponsor H.R. 892, the Pre-Existing Conditions Protection Act. This bill would prohibit application of pre-existing condition exclusions and guarantee availability of health insurance coverage in the individual and group market, contingent on the enactment of legislation repealing Obamacare.

1/2/21 9:36,New Year. New Opportunities - Part 1,"January 2, 2021 
Dear Fellow Marylander, 
Happy New Year! We’ve scraped through what possibly was the longest and most consequential year of our lives.
As we look at 2020 in the rearview mirror, we also look to the year ahead with optimism tinged with the knowledge that things likely will get worse before they get better. 
Our nation is facing record-high deaths, hospitalizations, and COVID-19 cases in our country. Our hospitals are being stretched to capacity. We are now on track to surpass 400,000 lives lost to the virus before the end of January. 
Unfortunately, because not everyone has followed the basic public health guidelines of wearing a mask, staying six feet from someone outside your household and washing hands frequently, we have to anticipate that infections from holiday outings and gatherings soon will produce growing case counts – and a soaring death toll. Even though we are beginning to roll out the revolutionary vaccines that the scientific community has delivered in an incredibly short time, it may not be until spring that we begin to see significant improvements in our overall public health threshold.   
Our highest priority for 2021 is finally to execute a comprehensive, coordinated federal response to turn the tide against COVID-19. I know this is the highest priority for President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, both of whom will be sworn into office on January 20 
The Biden-Harris administration will need to clean up the deadly mess left behind by President Trump. For starters, the current plan to distribute vaccines is falling behind so badly that we are nowhere near 20 million vaccinations by the end of the year, as promised. 
As the new Congress is sworn into office tomorrow (January 3), my colleagues and I should be ready to work with the new administration and support its efforts to confront this virus fully and properly. The rapid, widespread distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine is quite possibly the greatest operational challenge we have faced as a nation. Congress must give the new administration the resources it needs to save American lives. 
This country cannot achieve an economic recovery, or make needed progress on countless other pressing issues, until we course-correct toward a public health recovery. But delivering that will take far more than getting appropriate amounts of vaccines, distributed equitably and free of charge, to every community in the country.
Emerging from the pandemic also will require a massive public education campaign to amplify the importance of getting vaccinated. Not only do we need to overcome the natural hesitation to get a needle in the arm, we must combat the effects of the chronic misinformation from those who diminish the lethality of the virus or dismiss it as “just the flu."" 
We also must encourage and embrace bold executive actions, like the use of the Defense Production Act, to meet the pandemic’s continued public health and economic challenges. Similar to the regional problems faced in March and April, currently, many frontline medical personnel nationwide are dealing with critical day-to-day shortages of personal protective equipment and therapeutic supplies; shortfalls in testing continue to delay diagnoses; and there are acute needs in the realm of vaccine materials that need to be addressed immediately.
While President Trump primarily used the Defense Production Act to shield companies from the threat of lawsuits from workers who may become infected, my sincere hope is that the new Biden-Harris administration will use the tools they have to truly elevate the public health, not corporate liability protections
Like so many other things, the Trump administration also has been erratic in its consultation with all governors nationwide, leading to critical communication breakdowns in several states that are slowing vaccine and medical supply distribution. This often-partisan dynamic must cease immediately. I am heartened to see a series of bipartisan conversations underway between President-Elect Biden and governors from across the country, and I trust that these essential exchanges will continue.    
We must inject a renewed spirit of action for the collective good. Wearing a mask must be automatic. Social distancing, however challenging, has to be our continued modus operandi.  And “wash your hands” must remain our mantra.
This pandemic is not insurmountable. Its effects have been devastating, and its shadow long. But we can emerge from it. I know we can. Finally having a true partner and leader in the White House will go a long way toward easing America’s suffering. 
This will be in the front of my mind next week when the House and Senate will meet in a joint session to officially receive and count the electoral votes that confirm the election of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.
I’ve likely never welcomed a new year – or a new administration – quite so fervently. 
Thank you for joining me in helping to change the momentum of this pandemic, and this nation.
Your friend and public servant,

1/31/21 18:21,More help is on the way,"Friends,   Here’s what I was up to this week: 
 


ONE: Helping Jobless Americans Get Coverage
Over the last year, millions of Americans have lost their jobs because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and along with it, the health insurance coverage they need. For months, the Trump Administration refused my call to re-open the Affordable Care Act marketplaces so that families could access new health coverage options. Thankfully, this week President Biden did the commonsense thing and signed an executive order to do just that. Governor Murphy immediately followed suit by announcing that New Jersey’s marketplace at  GetCoveredNJ.nj.gov will remain open for enrollment until May 15, 2021. As we continue to battle COVID-19 and its economic fallout, no one should have to risk financial ruin as a result of getting sick. Visit GetCoveredNJ.nj.gov to learn more. 
 

TWO: Increasing Vaccine Supply
This week, I joined Governor Murphy to tour the Meadowlands vaccination mega-site in Bergen County. It has the capacity to vaccinate up to 2,400 daily – but that largely depends on the availability of supply. While the President announced that vaccine distribution will increase by 16 percent next week, more must be done. That’s why Democrats are gearing up to pass a new, bigger, bolder COVID relief bill that not only puts money into the hands of struggling families and small businesses, but invests in the production and distribution of vaccines and other critical medical supplies. We are in a race against COVID-19 and we must do everything in our power to win this fight.
 

THREE: Fighting to Restore Property Tax Deductions
In 2017, Republicans rammed corporate tax cuts through Congress on the backs of middle-class homeowners in New Jersey and across America by gutting the property tax deduction. It was wrong then, and it is wrong now. That’s why, this week, I joined my colleagues to introduce the SALT Deductibility Act to restore the state and local tax deduction and provide much-needed relief to homeowners. Allowing families to deduct their property taxes from their federal income tax bills saves them money and protects investments in things that matter to all of us – like education, infrastructure, public safety and more.

12/24/20 10:17,Finding Hope This Holiday Season,"Finding Hope This Holiday Season
The holiday season usually marks a time when family and friends gather together, but many Americans are planning different types of celebrations this year, choosing to help keep their loved ones and communities safe by following the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines. We all hope the hard decisions we make this year will allow us to be together next year.   We cannot and should not minimize the gravity of the situation that many families have found themselves in this holiday season, including the loss of a loved one or the loss of income. But we can still find reasons for hope.   Just this week, I felt hopeful as Congress came together on a bipartisan basis to pass a long overdue, additional COVID-19 relief package. This package will directly help struggling Americans by extending the eviction moratorium and providing direct relief, housing assistance, and extended unemployment insurance benefits. I urge the President to sign this bill into law without delay.   I also found hope earlier this month while watching health care workers in New Hampshire and across the country receive the first vaccinations. They have battled this virus – often at personal expense – in an effort to save lives and quell the ongoing pandemic.   And as always, what gives me the most hope is the generosity and resilience I’ve seen across the country, but especially in the state of New Hampshire. Throughout this year, Granite Staters have shown up for one another over and over again. That all-hands-on-deck spirit has always been at our core, but at a time like this it makes all the difference.  If we continue to approach this challenging time with that same compassion and earnestness, we will get through this and we will be stronger for it. I know we can do it.  So from my family to yours, Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays. May you find peace, solace, and joy in this season of light. 
With every good wish,     Senator Maggie Hassan

February 06, 2021
Dear Friend,
 
The last month has been challenging – but I’ve never been more confident in our future and our democracy than I am now.
 
As Congress reconvened ready to serve in the New Year, we faced an important duty: to certify the votes of the Electoral College. The certification has been conducted following every presidential election in U.S. history and this year it was the final step to certify Joe Biden and Kamala Harris the President and Vice President-Elect of the United States. Our work was disrupted by violent insurrectionists attacking the Capitol, incited by irresponsible rhetoric.
 
While my colleagues, staff, and I remained safe, my heart remains broken by the insurrection that erupted and the desecration of our Capitol, a building that is the living embodiment of our liberty and democracy, a temple that represents the sanctity of the rule of law, the voice of the people, and the fundamental values we hold dear. I’ve recorded a short video sharing my thoughts on the attack and what it means for our country – I hope you take a moment to watch it.
 
Following the deadly attack on the Capitol, Congress reconvened and was able to certify the 2020 election. On January 20 America inaugurated its 46th President, Joe Biden, and Vice President Kamala Harris, the first woman and person of color to be elected to that office. In just a few days, we have seen President Biden take action to acknowledge and address the spread of coronavirus, speed up vaccine distribution, stop family separation at the border, get America back at the table on climate change, take steps to dismantle systemic racism, and bring humility and grace to the White House. I am heartened by the team President Biden is forming to help lead our country. It is clear that President Biden is ready and able to bring our country together and lead us forward.
 
Our union remains strong. Our democracy may bend, but it will never break. As we begin a new chapter, let us find it within ourselves to unite, heal, and, move forward as one United States.
 
Sincerely,
 
Marcy Kaptur

A Doctor's Note 
Last week, I continued my efforts to get Americans back to work and finding answers regarding the origins of COVID-19. The government created labor shortage is negatively impacting our nation’s economic recovery, which is why we must put a stop to the increased federal unemployment benefits that have made it more lucrative to stay at home rather than return to work. For these reasons, I introduced the Get Americans Back to Work Act, which encourages Americans to return to work and fill the over 8 million open jobs across the country.  As you know, COVID-19 continues to wreak havoc on our nation, and we must get to the bottom of where this virus came from. Not only did I introduced a resolution calling for a bipartisan Select Committee to investigate the origins of COVID-19 but, as you’ll see below, I also questioned Dr. Fauci about it.  Before we dive deeper into the issues, even though National Police Week came to a close Saturday, I want to once again say thank you to all of our officers who sacrifice so much to keep our communities safe. As the son of a police chief, I have a special place in my heart for each of you and am so grateful for all you do.  I'm honored to serve as your voice in Washington, D.C. My family and I take this responsibility seriously and we are proud to represent all Kansans in the U.S. Senate. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me on my website: https://www.marshall.senate.gov/.  Sincerely, 
 
Getting Americans Back to Work 
Throughout my travels across Kansas I hear constantly how employers are struggling to find people for open jobs because folks are staying at home due to the rich unemployment benefits and the stimulus checks that Democrats continue to enhance. So last week, I introduced legislation to repeal the increase in unemployment benefits brought on by President Biden and the Democrats. While there are certainly people that needed access to increased unemployment benefits during the heart of this pandemic, we should not be in the business of creating lucrative government dependency that makes it more beneficial to stay unemployed rather than return to work. My Get Americans Back to Work Act, decreases federal unemployment benefits to $150 per week at the end of May, and then fully repeals them out at the end of June. It’s time to put an end to President Biden’s government imposed labor shortage, and this legislation is a giant step in the right direction.   In fact, I even called on Governor Laura Kelly to halt the increase in federal unemployment benefits for our state. You may click HERE or on the image below to watch my remarks. 

COVID-19 Origins Investigation
Last week, I introduced a resolution calling for a bipartisan Select Committee to investigate the origins of COVID-19. This pandemic has claimed over three million lives, yet critical questions remain unanswered about its origins. The only way we will ever understand how this virus came about is if we demand full access to all relevant records, samples, and key personnel. We cannot allow bad actors to continue to prevent this investigation from happening. For these reasons, Congress must start our own parallel investigation now, which is why I have called for a bipartisan Select Committee to investigate the origins of COVID-19 in full. The committee would consist of an equal number of Republicans and Democrats, chosen by the Leaders of their respective parties, and would have one year to compete its investigation and report to Congress and the American people.  I penned an op-ed for FOX News to explain the need for an in depth investigation into the origins of COVID-19 titled, “The COVID-19 mystery – we've lost 3 million lives and critical questions need answers.” If you’d like to learn more about the need for the investigation, make sure to give it a read by clicking HERE.   I was also able to question Dr. Anthony Fauci at a Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) hearing about the origins of COVID-19. You may click HERE or on the image below to watch the back and forth – I think you’ll like it.   

Saving Local Businesses
Last week was also a big week for Kansas’ small businesses. I introduced legislation called the Save Local Business Act, which clarifies the joint employer standard. The current definition of a joint employer is obscure and broad, and is a clear example of federal overreach. As a result, business owners from construction companies, manufacturers to franchisees are faced with confusing rules and uncertainty about their legal liabilities. The Save Local Business Act will provide clarification and certainty for small businesses while strengthening protections for American workers. I see this as a chance to cut the red tape hindering the American dream for so many hardworking folks, and I’m glad my colleagues joined in on this fight. The Hill wrote a great piece on this issue, be sure to check it out HERE. 
Standing with Israel
The acts of terror carried out against Israel must be condemned. I want to be very clear, the U.S. stands with Israel and supports its right to defend itself against those who seek its destruction, which is why I joined my colleagues in sending a letter to President Biden urging him to support Israel’s right to self-defense and to ensure that sanctions relief is not provided to Iran. Make no mistake, ending sanctions on the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism will only result in more deaths across the Middle East. The people of Israel are under attack, and we continue to pray for peace, safety, and comfort as these acts of terror continue. We must continue to stand by our ally, face the threats of our enemies head-on, and follow the Reagan doctrine of peace through strength.

JANUARY 11, 2021: MANCHIN MEETS WITH SECRETARY OF DEFENSE NOMINEE AUSTIN  Charleston, WV – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, met with Secretary of Defense nominee Retired General Lloyd Austin.     ""As a former Governor, I understand how critical it is for the President to choose their cabinet. General Austin bravely served our nation for over four decades and has proven he is a dedicated American who will lead the Department of Defense with experience and leadership. President-elect Biden has selected him to fulfill the position of Secretary of Defense because he fully believes General Austin understands the role of our military in subordination to civilian command. After meeting with him today I am convinced of that as well, and I believe the Senate should move to confirm General Austin as Defense Secretary on day one of the Biden Administration. I look forward to working with him and my colleagues to strengthen the United States’ role as the hope of the world.”

MANCHIN URGES ADMINISTRATION TO IMMEDIATELY ADDRESS COVID-19 VACCINE DISTRIBUTION ISSUES  Charleston, WV – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) led 45 Senators in urging U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar to take immediate action to fix the significant issues of the COVID-19 vaccine distribution as coronavirus cases continue to climb. The Senators called on the Administration to work and communicate with state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments, vaccine and PPE manufacturers, public health experts, and healthcare providers to develop a plan for COVID-19 vaccine distribution and administration.  The Senators said in part, “We write to you with concerns about significant challenges in COVID-19 vaccine distribution and administration across the country and to outline key actions the Trump Administration should have taken—and must now take—to address these challenges. With our health system and economy in crisis, and millions of lives at stake, we cannot afford for this vaccination campaign to continue to be hindered by the lack of planning, communication, and leadership we have seen so far.""

5/14/21 19:20,NEW: CDC Mask Guidance and Vaccine Updates from Rep. Lieu,"Visit My Website

 Dear neighbor,  
This was an encouraging week in the fight against COVID-19. The CDC announced that they are no longer recommending that fully vaccinated people need to wear masks – whether inside or outside – except where required by federal, state, local, tribal, or territorial laws, rules, and regulations, including local business and workplace guidance. Although the CDC made this recommendation, it’s critical that LA County residents adhere to local guidance to keep our community safe. Los Angeles County is currently reviewing the new recommendations in order to make adjustments to its public health guidance. In the interim, please note that fully vaccinated people do not need to wear a mask when indoors around other fully vaccinated people, or outside in uncrowded areas. For more information from LA Public Health, please click here.  Los Angeles County is making great progress in administering the COVID-19 vaccine. If we continue with our increased vaccination rate, the county could reach herd immunity by mid- to late July. However, this will only happen if people continue to get vaccinated. If you haven’t already, please get vaccinated to help our community recover. Also, please encourage the people you know to get the vaccine. The more people vaccinated, the faster we can get back to normal.  More great news! Everyone age 12 and older is eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine in LA County. Children ages 12-17 are only eligible to receive the Pfizer vaccine. If you have children of these ages in your household, please help them sign up for a vaccine. The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health is also holding a Vaccine Virtual Town Hall for parents who have questions about vaccinating children. To submit your question, please click here. The virtual town hall will be held on Tuesday, May 18th at 6 p.m on Twitter, YouTube, and Facebook at @lapublichealth. 

While we get shots in arms, the American Rescue Plan is providing much-needed financial relief to American families and businesses. Thanks to this comprehensive stimulus and relief package, eligible American families will receive up to $300/month, per child as part of the advanced monthly Child Tax Credit payments. If you haven’t already filed your 2020 tax return, please make sure to do so before Monday, May 17th to ensure your family starts getting payments as soon as possible. This relief could benefit the families of 7.8 million children in California, helping lift 553,000 children out of poverty.

 
HELP IS HERE for California 
The American Rescue Plan provides a total of $350 billion in emergency state and local funding to help communities across the United States recover. I’m pleased that the state of California will receive $43 billion to support healthy communities, struggling businesses, hard-hit families, and frontline workers. More locally, Los Angeles County will receive a total of $1,949,978,847 to support COVID response and relief efforts.   In addition, Governor Newsom unveiled this week the California Comeback Plan, a $100 billion comprehensive economic recovery plan to help the state emerge from the COVID-19 crisis. The plan provides Golden State Stimulus Checks of at least $600 for two-thirds of Californians and billions for rental relief and to cover overdue water and electricity bills. The package also invests in tackling homelessness with $12 billion to create 46,000 new housing units and expand key programs like Project Homekey – seeking to end family homelessness within 5 years. I applaud Governor Newsom for prioritizing solutions to homelessness in the CA Comeback plan and for this comprehensive approach to helping Californians build back stronger than before.  
  
Get Vaccinated! 
Los Angeles County has now administered over 8.6 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Please view the information below to see what percentage of your community has received at least one dose of the vaccine. Help your community get to 100% by getting vaccinated and encouraging others to do the same.

Everyone age 12 and older who lives or works in LA County is eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Please check VaccinateLACounty.com for updated information on walk-in vaccinations. You can also book an appointment for a vaccine ahead of time by going to VaccinateLACounty.com or Coronavirus.LACity.org/VaxAppointment.  If you have a disability or do not have access to the internet and need assistance making your vaccination appointment, you can contact the County’s Call Center –– open from 8:00 a.m. to 8:30 p.m. –– at (833) 540-0473. The vaccine is free to all people and immigration status and insurance are not required.   NEW: You can text your ZIP code to 438829 (GETVAX) in English or 822862 (VACUNA) in Spanish to receive 3 locations near you with available vaccines, as well as contact information for those sites. If you’d rather go online, you can visit Vaccines.gov to find available vaccines near you. If you’d like to get this information over the phone, you can call the National COVID-19 Vaccination Assistance Hotline at 1 (800) 232-0233.

Congressional Report
 
 
Dear Friend,
 
Today, marks a historic moment for our country. As we inaugurate President-elect Joseph R. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, we begin the process of healing the soul of our nation. It's time we pull together the full weight of the federal government and move forward with efforts to defeat COVID-19 and reopen our economy safely.
 
Congress and the new administration will be ready on Day One to provide urgent relief to millions of families across our nation. With President-elect Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, we will get more people vaccinated, create more vaccination sites, increase vaccine supply and distribution, mobilize more frontline personnel, and enhance transparency to the American public. 
 
I am committed to ensuring that South Texas receives the necessary resources to combat the virus and I look forward to working with the Biden administration in addressing the needs of working families. It's time to welcome a new chapter in our democracy. It's time to get to work. 
 
As always, if you need assistance with a federal agency, please contact one of my offices. 

 
 
Rep. Cuellar Receives Award from Texas Nursery & Landscaping Association
 

  
On Friday, January 15th, I received the Advocacy Leadership Award from the Texas Nursery & Landscaping Association. Whether it is fighting for small businesses, ensuring our workforce has the support they need, or advocating for more accessible and affordable water resources, I am committed to supporting policies that create prosperity for the Texas Green Industry.
 
Pictured is Rep. Cuellar receiving the Advocacy Leadership Award. 

 
 
Rep. Cuellar Honored as Distinguished Leader of  Our Community
 

  
Later that afternoon, I had the privilege of joining CBP Deputy Director Albert Flores as well as Sergeant Genaro Hinojosa on behalf of the Texas Department of Public Safety at the Laredo Motor Carriers Association's award ceremony to receive the Distinguished Leader of Our Community award. By working with LMCA, we have strengthened Laredo’s trucking industry as well as proactively expanded compliance with federal, state and local laws. As the representative of the busiest land port of entry, I will continue to be a strong advocate for Laredo’s trucking industry by strengthening international trade at the border and taking critical steps at expanding infrastructure in South Texas.

Touring the Rio Grande Valley
 

  
On Thursday, January 14th, I resumed my district tour and visited elected officials and constituents from Rio Grande City, Mission, Palmhurst, Palmview, Penitas, Sullivan and La Joya. At each stop, we discussed updates on the COVID relief package, vaccine distribution as well as how I plan on working with the Biden administration to stop border wall construction.

Thank You National Guard
 

  
On Wednesday, January 13th, I wanted to take a moment in between votes to deliver pizza and thank the members of the National Guard who are protecting our nation’s Capitol. I am eternally grateful for these brave service men and women and their selfless service to our democracy.
 
The Capitol is usually filled with tourists and students, interested in learning our country’s history and seeing our government work. However, seeing hundreds of service members at the Capitol shows the severity of the crisis that was caused by Trump's dangerous rhetoric. These brave service men and women are the antithesis of the rioters who recently attacked this building.

WHAT I'M WORKING ON
 
  
On Monday, I visited the Virginia National Guard's Army Aviation Support Facility in Sandston. I was shown around and even got an aerial tour on board a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter. I am so grateful to the Guard for inviting me to visit, and for keeping our Commonwealth safe and strong.
  

  
On Thursday, I was so excited to celebrate the use of CARES Act funding for extended deployment of 5G-capable high-speed internet in Spotsylvania County. The pandemic has made it even more clear how a lack of reliable internet access makes everyday life difficult — particularly in rural and underserved communities. We are moving closer to closing the digital divide in our Seventh District communities.
  


  
Thursday afternoon, I visited with local restaurant owners and employees to discuss the COVID-related challenges they have been facing, their experiences with the Paycheck Protection Program, and the much-needed $28.6 billion dedicated to restaurants in the American Rescue Plan. These funds will go to small, locally owned restaurants as they work towards inviting in more customers in the coming months. These businesses are incredibly important to our communities, and this funding is critical for so many.
  
 

 
  
On Friday, Representative Joe Neguse and I led 65 of our House colleagues in urging Senate Majority Leader Schumer to bring lifesaving gun violence prevention bills to the floor for a vote. It has been 22 days since the House passed two bipartisan bills to close existing background check loopholes. In that short span of time, Americans have been murdered in their neighborhoods, grocery stores, and workplaces. The American people expect action. CLICK HERE TO READ OUR LETTER
 
Friday afternoon, I visited the Midlothian Apothecary to learn more about their process for administering COVID-19 vaccines, as well as making sign-ups and vaccinations accessible. Our community pharmacies have stepped up to the plate as we work to vaccinate the Commonwealth. I also visited a CVS Pharmacy location in Richmond to see firsthand CVS Health's vaccine clinic format, inventory management systems, and in-store capabilities.

INCITEMENT OF INSURRECTION

I couldn’t imagine what would prompt me to pursue another impeachment of Donald Trump. And then a violent mob attacked one of the most sacred symbols of our democracy, the U.S. Capitol, intent on destruction and harm.  

Even with only a few days left of the Trump presidency, we must always ensure our President will preserve, protect and defend the U.S. Constitution, as is required of the oath of office. President Trump has shown he will not and cannot be trusted to uphold his oath. He has damaged the Constitution and damaged America. Each and every one of us has a responsibility to reduce the continued threats of violence on fellow Americans and ensure the government transitions peacefully. Therefore, I solemnly voted once again to impeach Donald Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors, specifically “incitement of insurrection”.

To read more about my views on the events of the last week or so, I encourage you to read my piece published here in the Colorado Sun.

COVID IN COLORADO

RECENT COVID RELIEF: On December 21st, Congress passed the sixth major COVID relief package, H.R. 133, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act. Here's a rundown of a few of the items that might impact you and your family:

• Economic Impact Payments - The package provided an additional round of Economic Impact Payments of $600 for individuals making up to $75,000 per year and $1,200 for couples making up to $150,000 per year, as well as a $600 payment for each child dependent. This means a family of four could receive $2,400 in direct payments. It also expanded these direct payments to mixed-status households, which is retroactive to the CARES Act. Click here for frequently asked questions and more information.

• Unemployment Assistance - This bill provided an additional $300 per week for all workers receiving unemployment benefits, through March 14, 2021. This bill also extends the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program, with expanded coverage to the self-employed, gig workers, and others in non-traditional employment, and the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) program, which provides additional weeks of federally-funded unemployment benefits to individuals who exhaust their regular state benefits. However, the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE) will need to receive guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor before issuing the newly enacted benefits and it could take several weeks before claimants receive benefits.

• Rental and Mortgage Assistance - The CDC's national eviction moratorium has been extended until January 31, 2021.

• Paycheck Protection Program / EIDL - On January 11th, the SBA began a staggered reopening of the Paycheck Protection Program. Only small community financial institutions are able to submit PPP loan applications to the SBA, followed by all authorized lenders. Second-draw loans will be available to small businesses and non-profits with 300 or fewer employees and can demonstrate a 25% reduction in gross receipts between comparable quarters in 2019 and 2020. For more information about the Paycheck Protection Program, visit SBA.gov.

VACCINE DISTRIBUTION IN COLORADO: The supply of the COVID-19 in Colorado remains limited, and vaccinations will be prioritized for high-risk health care workers and Coloradans most at risk for severe cases of COVID-19. The general public should not expect to receive the vaccine until summer 2021. To get the facts on the COVID-19 vaccine and to see when and where you can expect to receive a vaccine, please visit CDPHE’s website at covid19.colorado.gov/vaccine or call the CO-HELP hotline at 303-389-1687.

LEVEL ORANGE: Jefferson County and Adams County are currently in Level Orange, according to Colorado's COVID-19 dial.

If you have questions or need help accessing COVID-related benefits, please call my office at (303) 274-7944.


GOOD NEWS REPORT: SPECIALIST CHO

In Washington D.C. this week, while I was purchasing coffee for a group of National Guard members from New Jersey, I got to talking with a few National Guard members from Delaware and learned about Specialist Cho who had to miss his citizenship ceremony because he had been deployed to the U.S. Capitol.

I immediately went to work to get him sworn in as a U.S. citizen as soon as possible and I'm proud he was able to do so today. I’m glad I could play a small role in helping one of our men in uniform become a citizen of the country he’s currently helping to defend and protect. I never thought I’d see this type of deployment to the U.S. Capitol but I greatly appreciate the service of the men and women who have come to Washington D.C. to ensure a peaceful transition of government, including Specialist Cho.



And a big thank you to Senator Coons of Delaware, Delaware Governor Carney, and Rep. Lofgren of California who helped make this happen so quickly.


ARTEMIS ASTRONAUT AND COLORADO NATIVE DISCUSSES MISSION TO MOON

This week, I hosted a discussion with NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine and Artemis Astronaut Matthew Dominick as students of the 7th Congressional District asked them questions about the Artemis mission, NASA priorities and much more. 

On the virtual town hall, Dominick, a native of Wheat Ridge, Colorado, shared his journey of graduating from high school in Golden, Colorado to becoming an astronaut and what he is looking forward to most about the Artemis missions. Administrator Bridenstine weighed in with what NASA has accomplished during his time leading the agency and the missions ahead for NASA.

Hydropower is the largest source of clean, renewable energy in the country. My bill, the Pacific Northwest Pumped Storage Hydropower Development Act, will streamline the permitting process for pumped storage hydroelectric projects to increase renewable energy production and storage. It also paves the way for a pumped storage project right here in Central Washington that will create jobs and boost our already-thriving clean energy sector.

100 Days of Division and Disappointment


I sat down for an exclusive interview with KIMA Action News to discuss the Biden Administration's first 100 days. The President promised ""unity"" during the campaign, but has delivered a hyper-partisan agenda instead of working towards bipartisan policy solutions, and has governed by executive order rather than by consensus building. The President himself has described the situation at our southern border as a ""crisis."" It's time to quit incentivizing people to cross our border illegally and come up with solutions to address this emergency. 

To put it simply, the first 100 days of the Biden Administration haven't brought unity, only division and disappointment.

WATCH: I was honored to receive letters from band members at West Valley Middle School in Yakima. 

6th grader, Caleb, said of his band class, ""It's helped build up my confidence and even has made me make new friends. It's also what made me happy to go to school during Tuesday and Friday.""

It's clear how important in-person classes like band and other music education classes are to students and how important it is that we - safely - reopen our schools to ensure these resources and opportunities remain available to them.

Conservation Capital of the Northwest


WATCH: I joined the Conservation Coalition to discuss how Central Washington is leading the nation on conservation.

Yesterday was Earth Day, and I am proud to represent a district that leads the way on conservation and environmental stewardship. In Central Washington, our agriculture producers understand that to continue their important job of feeding the world, we must work together to conserve our precious natural resources. 

This week, I introduced the Conservation and Innovative Climate Partnership Act to give our local producers, land-grant universities, USDA-NRCS, state governments, and entities like non-profits the resources they need to expand upon the conservation efforts that are already under way.

The Green New Deal Will Destroy American Jobs


The Green New Deal is a radical wish list that will decimate our economy, destroy good-paying American jobs, and exacerbate the damage already done to our energy sector by the Biden Administration. It was unacceptable before, and it is unacceptable now. 

Unfortunately, President Biden's ""infrastructure"" plan is little more than Green New Deal proposals with shiny new branding. We can't continue to mortgage our children's future. With less than 8% actually going towards our nation’s infrastructure, this “infrastructure"" package is not the way to go.

12/2/20 20:45,District Connection: Vaccination Updates from Operation Warp Speed,"COVID-19 Update | December 2, 2020
View Email in Browser 
 
Dear Friend,

Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have witnessed the heroic efforts made by our nation’s public health officials and researchers to develop vaccines and therapeutics to fight the virus. I commend their hard work and dedication. I look forward to vaccines being made available to the public in the coming weeks.

I commend the Trump Administration’s efforts to implement Operation Warp Speed, which has significantly improved the rate at which research and clinical trials have taken place to produce a vaccine. To date, several companies have applied to the FDA for emergency authorization to produce their vaccine. 

Several of these companies, Pfizer, Moderna, and AstraZeneca, recently released data from their vaccine candidates, and all 3 reported an efficacy rate above 90% in phase three human clinical trials. 

As the White House announced in a press conference the week before Thanksgiving, these vaccine candidates must be approved as effective and safe by the FDA and given an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) before distribution to the American people, especially those at the greatest risk of infection, is possible.

I’m grateful for the collaboration in Congress, from both sides of the aisle, to deliver bipartisan support through the CARES Act. This opened up money for our state governments and health officials to fight the virus and fund $10 billion for Operation Warp Speed. 

Through the hard work of our nation’s leaders, health care professionals, and researchers, America is on track to beat COVID-19, restore our health, and rebuild our economy.
 

Rep. Hill discusses Operation Warp Speed with OANN’s Stephanie Hamill

THE CHINA TASK FORCE CONTINUES TO HOLD CHINA ACCOUNTABLE

As we have witnessed over the past few years, China continues to flout international law regarding human rights, intellectual property theft, and military expansion.
I spoke on the House Floor to encourage the United States to enact targeted policies to prevent China’s aggression against our nation, our allies, and many nations around the globe.


In light of China’s infractions against international law, I commend Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, House Foreign Affairs Committee Republicans' Ranking Member Michael McCaul, and the entire China Task Force for taking essential steps to limit China’s threat to the global system.
After months of work, the Task Force has released 82 key findings and 430 associated recommendations to Congress, emphasizing the necessary work that we must do to limit China’s aggressiveness in East Asia and across the globe. 
Despite bipartisan support for these efforts to combat China’s destabilizing actions, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi refuses to participate in these essential efforts to protect our national security. I urge my Democratic colleagues to work with House Republicans and form a comprehensive strategy to combat China's efforts to expand its influence.
We must come together in order to protect freedom and security, both for ourselves and for our allies around the globe.

RELIGIOUS FREEDOM IS A TENET OF AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY

Recently, I was interviewed by Erik Rosales from EWTN News Nightly, where we discussed my Catholic faith and how it informs my public service.
My faith is my foundation, and I recognize that it is my responsibility as your Congressman to defend the right to religious freedom, both here in the United States and abroad.
During this time of COVID-19, we discussed how it is important to ensure that our elected leaders support safe means for worshippers to practice their freedom of religion – both in person as well as remotely. 

We also discussed that, while we in the United States have the freedom of religion written into our Constitution, many abroad are denied this freedom by their government. My resolution, H.Res. 49, which I introduced last year in Congress, would defend the Coptic Christians in Egypt, who are not only persecuted for their faith by terrorist groups, such as ISIS, but they are also persecuted by their own fellow Egyptians.
My resolution would require the Egyptian government to protect these Christians for their faith and to halt discrimination within local officials against the Coptic faith.
In our own Constitution, the Bill of Rights lists freedom of religion as the “first freedom” in the First Amendment. Allowing people to practice and believe as they wish is fundamental to protecting our human rights and religious freedom; it must be central in shaping U.S. foreign policy and priorities.
I will continue to support legislation that protects the religious freedom of all, both in the U.S. and abroad.

PROTECTING OUR ALLIES AGAINST NUCLEAR THREAT

Standing Strong Against Iran

In a recent interview with Fox News, I discussed how the United States must continue to protect itself against the Iranian regime.
With the killing of Iranian nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh last week in an ambush, Iran’s foreign minister has shifted the blame upon our ally, Israel, accusing the nation of developing a ‘new method’ in order to kill the nuclear scientist.
These recent developments make it more than clear that President Trump did the right thing when he exited from the Iranian nuclear deal, added sanctions, and increased pressure upon the regime. 

Throughout my five years of expert witness testimony before the Financial Services Committee, I have seen first-hand Iran’s support of international terrorism and disregard for international law. Iran poses a significant threat as a major developer of nuclear weapons, and our nation’s leaders cannot allow the regime to use this nuclear development as a threat against our nation, our allies, and the region.
With Iran as the biggest terrorist threat in the Middle East, the U.S. must stand with the Iranian people and continue to take concrete steps to press Iran for change and prevent exporting terror abroad and repression of their citizens at home.

PRESERVING ARKANSAS’S HABITAT FOR THE FUTURE

Protecting the Tradition of Duck Hunting
 This past week, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette published an op-ed that Congressman Rick Crawford, Congressman Steve Womack, Congressman Bruce Westerman, and I wrote about the importance of duck hunting, which is fundamental to our identity as Arkansans and our economy.
Duck hunting goes beyond a hobby or tradition. It is a way of life, firmly founded in Arkansas history, culture, and economy throughout generations. 
Located in the heart of the Mississippi Alluvial Valley, Arkansas is a haven for waterfowl habitat, conservation, and duck hunting.
In addition, Arkansas remains a prime destination for not only local duck-hunters, but also for nearly 100,000 hunters, who travel to Arkansas to experience for themselves the joys of duck hunting in a rice field or flooded timber.
With more than 50,000 acres of greentree reservoir, some of which are in grave danger of loss, I commend Ducks Unlimited and Arkansas Game and Fish Commission for launching a private-public partnership to restore the fortunes of these reservoirs. Just this past year, along with private and corporate partners, they have invested more than $4 million to begin repairing and replacing outdated water control infrastructure.
We are proud to do our part in keeping Arkansas the “Duck Hunting Capital of the World.” We will continue to protect this pastime and the habitats that enable it.

5/14/21 14:13,Matt's Weekly Memo - American Rescue Plan Continues to Deliver for NEPA,"Click here to view this email in your browser 


 
Over $350 Million is Coming to NEPA for Jobs and Schools: This is the American Rescue Plan at Work.
 
  
Dear Lindsey,  Our local governments are the backbone of our communities. They're made up of firefighters, police officers, emergency first responders, garbage collectors, street cleaners and more. During the pandemic, we have relied on these frontline workers more than ever to keep us safe and protect our neighborhoods. But their jobs have only gotten more difficult this past year as we continue to address the fallout of the crisis.
 
This week I was proud to announce $330 million for the counties and cities of Northeastern Pennsylvania from the American Rescue Plan that I helped pass in March. This money will go toward keeping public employees on payroll and maintaining essential public services we all rely on.
 
But that's not all...
 
The American Rescue Plan is delivering $58 million for our local colleges, universities and students. This funding will help them recover from the financial hardships brought on by the pandemic, and help them keep their doors open to continue serving our community. It also gets relief in students' hands: at least half of the funding each institution receives is required to go directly to students that are facing hunger, homelessness or other hardships. 
 
Relief for frontline public workers, colleges and students. Lindsey, these are the latest examples of the American Rescue Plan at work in our communities. I'm looking forward to working with our local leaders to ensure these federal investments improve the lives of Northeastern Pennsylvanians of all ages for years to come.
 
Watch what I had to say about it this week in Congress:
  
 

 
  
 
About that Child Tax Credit I Mentioned in the Video... IMPORTANT Deadline on May 17
 
  
All children deserve to grow up in a safe, loving environment. But throughout this pandemic, a lot of families have struggled to pay bills and put food on table. We need to make sure these families and these kids have the chance to get back on track.
 
That's why I helped pass an expansion of the Child Tax Credit through the American Rescue Plan. The expansion means eligible families could receive advance monthly payments of up to $300 per child each month for the rest of this year. In our area, this benefit could reach 126,100 children. 
 
To receive this benefit, families need to act now. The way to claim it and start receiving advance monthly payments as soon as this summer is by filing your taxes by the deadline on Monday, May 17  -- even if you don't normally file.
 
Earlier this week, I got together with one of my Pennsylvania Congressional colleagues and a local tax expert on Facebook Live to get the word out. You can watch the discussion below, but here's the takeaway: the best way for you to receive your money sooner, rather than later, is by filing a tax return. You can file online for free using the IRS Free File Tool. Tax forms can also be found at your local post office or library.
 
Watch the conversation:
  

  
 
Ensuring Equal Pay for Tobyhanna Employees
 
  
No matter where you work, all employees deserve to be paid fairly for their work. Employees at Tobyhanna Army Depot are valued workers who help make our military the best and most innovative in the world, but the federal pay system is outdated and unfair.
 
Under the current system, salaried workers have a pay scale reflecting current metropolitan markets, but the pay scale for hourly workers is still based on 1950s era military installation placements. This has led to a significant gap between the pay of salaried and hourly workers. 
 
I re-introduced the Locality Pay Equity Act with Senator Bob Casey this week to close this gap and apply the pay boundaries for salaried employees to hourly employees. This would simply raise the wages of hourly employees so that they receive equal pay with their salaried co-workers. We've been fighting this battle for a while, as some of you know, but I'm not giving up. I passed it through the House last year for the first time ever, but it got stuck in the Senate. Our work continues this Congress.
  
Read more about the bill here
  
 
COVID-19 Vaccine Update
 
  
Yesterday marked a major turning point in our fight against COVID-19 when the CDC announced that fully vaccinated people can resume activities without wearing a mask or staying six feet apart outdoors and indoors, with a few exceptions.
 
We got here because of the incredible work of our scientific community that produced safe and effective vaccines in record time, American Rescue Plan support to get shots in arms more quickly, and all of the American people who have rolled up their sleeves so far to get vaccinated. 
 
Our fight is not over yet, though. Millions of people still need to be fully vaccinated, but let's keep the progress going. All Pennsylvanians over the age of 16 are eligible, and children ages 12-15 are eligible to receive the Pfizer vaccine. Visit Vaccines.gov to make an appointment near you.
  

  
Be safe and well,

5/25/21 18:30,Hello Lindsey! An update from your Congresswoman!,"Hello from your Congresswoman!



IL COVID CASES ARE AT THEIR LOWEST LEVEL SINCE JULY!

Hey, IL-03! We've got some excellent news to report: the vaccines are working to get the virus under control! 

As of today, 50% of all Americans are vaccinated. In Illinois, more than 65% of adults have received at least one dose, and cases are at their lowest since July 24th. Visit here to learn more about our progress against the virus here. 

As a result of this progress, Illinois entered the bridge phase back to full reopening on Friday. For more information on what that means for you, click here.

REMEMBERING OUR FALLEN THIS MEMORIAL DAY

This weekend, I urge all IL-03 residents to have a safe Memorial Day holiday with their families. On Memorial Day and every day, we remember and pay our respects to the men and women who gave the ultimate sacrifice for their country.

Like many of you, this weekend is special to me because I come from a military family. We'll never forget the sacrifices our men and women in the military make every single day. 




ENSURING TRANSIT IS ACCESSIBLE FOR ALL

Last week, I introduced legislation to help make public transportation systems more accessible to passengers with disabilities as well as our seniors.

The All Stations Accessibility Program (ASAP) Act of 2021 would establish a federal grant program for transit organizations to upgrade their facilities to ensure they meet or exceed ADA requirements. 

Through this legislation, we can provide our cities with the funding they need to ensure their public transit systems can better serve all riders, especially those with disabilities and our seniors.

Read more about the legislation here.   




TACKLING POSTAL SERVICE DELAYS 

Our office is aware of the persistent and inexcusable mail delivery issues experienced by constituents in Mt Greenwood and Morgan Park.

To ensure USPS addresses these concerns, I am convening the first-ever meeting with the USPS District Manager for Illinois, Chicago Postmaster and local Chicago aldermen to address to demand a real solution to this issue that's been ignored for too long.

Last week, I spoke to the Beverly Review about my fight to get reliable mail service back to the district. Read more here. 

If you are experiencing mail delays, please contact my district office so we can assist you!




STRENGTHENING PROTECTIONS FOR PREGNANT WORKERS

Last week, I voted for the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act to combat pregnancy discrimination in the workplace.

Under this legislation, we're better protecting the rights of our workers by ensuring we address gender disparities in employment, and work to ensure that no worker faces discrimination for raising a family.



NAMED ONE OF THE MOST LEGISLATIVELY ACTIVE FRESHMEN IN CONGRESS

This week, Axios recognized our hard work in Congress and ranked our office as the third most legislatively active freshmen office in Congress. In fact, our office has sponsored and co-sponsored nearly 200 bills and resolutions to date. 

I won't stop working each and every day for you and the families of IL-03. 



CONDEMNING RISE IN HATE CRIMES AGAINST ASIAN AMERICANS 

Last week, I was proud to vote yes on a resolution to condemn the horrific mass shooting that took eight American lives in Georgia this past March.

Six of the individuals killed were Asian women. We must reaffirm our commitment to stop hate against the Asian-American community. 



Legislative Recap:

Need a recap of the work done over the past two weeks? Here are some of the important votes we've taken and bills I've cosponsored 👇

Dear Friend,  
This past week was National Hospital Week and National Police Week! These two groups deserve to be celebrated each and every day. Our nation's hospitals are on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic ensuring that our loved ones are healthy and researching the new vaccines that are saving countless lives today. Our policemen and women put their lives on the line to protect our communities. This week and every week, I always back to blue.
 
In Washington, I participated in two important Ways and Means Committee events. The first was a roundtable focused on children in the foster care system, where we discussed reauthorizing child welfare policies. In West Virginia, over 7,000 kids are in the foster care system. It is crucial we connect these children to loving, nurturing homes that will set them up for a successful future. Watch my full remarks here.
 
The second was a full Committee hearing, where I questioned U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Katherine Tai, on the Biden Administration's trade policies. Under President Trump, America became a net energy exporter and negotiated new and fair trade agreements, such as USMCA and the Phase One agreement with China. These agreements put American industry first, held trading partners accountable, created more jobs, and helped American workers, farmers, and businesses. I will continue to build on this progress and on my work to ensure that West Virginia energy, hardwoods, and manufacturing are at the forefront of American exports and trade agreements. Watch my full remarks by clicking the image below.

12/9/20 15:55,today's update,"News from Representative Rouzer


December 9, 2020 
  
Dear Friend, 
Several important items in today’s update: 
	•	Governor Cooper announced yesterday that he would be implementing a modified statewide stay-at-home order as COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and the percentage of cases coming up positive, and other trends continue to rise.  The order, which takes effect Friday at 5 p.m., requires individuals to stay home between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. and is expected to stay in place through the first week of January.  Exemptions like those found in the stay-at-home orders earlier this year, such as traveling to and from work or to obtain food or medical care, will still apply.  Businesses like restaurants, bars, entertainment venues will be required to close with at 10 p.m. (which certain exemptions) and the sale of alcoholic beverages will be prohibited for on-site consumption after 9 p.m.
	◦	The executive order can be found here.
	◦	A frequently-asked-questions document about the order is available here.   
	•	On the good news front, the Trump Administration’s Operation Warp Speed continues its historic success.  The FDA published documents this week indicating that it has found that Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate provides strong protection against the virus within about 10 days of the first of two doses, and that the vaccine works well regardless of a patient’s race, age or weight.  Just six months after President Trump launched Operation Warp Speed to deliver a safe, effective vaccine five times faster than any other vaccine in history, the FDA is on the verge of approving not one, but two vaccine candidates for use by the end of the year.  Manufacturing is underway at 23 sites nationwide and 20-40 million Americans will be able to receive the vaccine by the end of the month.  
	•	President Trump’s campaign continues to pursue its legal options regarding the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. The State of Texas filed suit last night against Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, claiming those states ignored or made changes to their election procedures in violation of federal law and the Constitution.  The Supreme Court has “original jurisdiction” of suits filed by states against one another, meaning the suit will go straight to the Supreme Court and bypass federal district and appellate courts.  Stay tuned for more as this, and other legal and legislative options being pursued by the campaign, continue.  Many of us in the House will be filing an amicus brief with the Court in support of this case.   
	•	Last night, I voted against the National Defense Authorization Act, which I ordinarily would not do.  There are a number of very important provisions in this bill.  But the way I see it, if we aren’t going to strike Section 230 for the social media giants now using this as the vehicle, it will not happen for some time.  After all, the NDAA is going to get adopted one way or another whether it is now or soon after the first of the year.  If this election proved anything, it proved that the social media giants are now publishers.  They should be treated as publishers and subject to the same laws as publishers.    Section 230 is a provision of law adopted with the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which provides immunity for websites that host content from those who post, comment, etc.  In other words, it is to protect the free-flow of information and opinion, regardless of whether it is factual.  Now that these social media giants are choosing what users can see, they are essentially picking winners and losers in the battle of ideas, truth, and free speech.  Certainly, a lot of what is on the internet is false or misleading, but it is not the job of social media giants to be the police of such.  That’s the job of each of us — to discern and think critically about all that we read and see.  Or to think about it another way, with Section 230 protections in place for Facebook, Google and all the other social media platforms out there, there is nothing to keep these social media giants from preventing the flow of factual information while boosting the flow of misinformation.  This is as much a threat to our republic as any foreign adversary!    
	•	Lastly, the House voted today on a 7-day stopgap government funding measure to prevent a looming government shutdown at the end of the week.  Negotiations on a longer-term funding package, as well as some form of COVID-19 relief, continue.  I remain hopeful that sometime in the next week or so both chambers will find common ground and put a compromise funding/COVID-19 relief package on the table that President Trump can sign into law.  
As always, stay tuned to Coronavirus.gov and the NC Department of Health and Human Services’ website for the latest on the outbreak.  And please feel free to send good news stories our way to highlight in this newsletter by replying to this e-mail.  
Sincerely,

4/13/21 17:01,The American Rescue Plan is Helping Maryland Defeat COVID-19,"April 13, 2021
The American Rescue Plan is Helping Maryland Defeat COVID-19
A MESSAGE FROM CONGRESSMAN HOYER 
The American Rescue Plan has helped quickly accelerate vaccination efforts in our state and I am pleased that more Marylanders are now eligible to receive their vaccine. Beginning this week, Marylanders 16 years of age and older are eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccines are available at mass vaccination sites, pharmacies, hospitals, and local health departments throughout the Fifth District. Click here to find a vaccination clinic near you. Alternatively, Marylanders can pre-register to receive their vaccine at a mass vaccination site here.   Last Thursday I was pleased to tour the new FEMA-run mass vaccination site in Greenbelt with Prince George’s County Executive Angela Alsobrooks. This new site, located at the Greenbelt Metro Station, will deliver thousands of shots into the arms of Marylanders. In February, I joined in urging the Biden Administration to stand up a federally-run vaccination site in Prince George’s County, and I was glad they granted our request.


In the afternoon, I visited Greater Baden Medical Services in Brandywine to speak with staff and learn more about the work they are doing to provide residents with access to affordable, quality health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Greater Baden was recently selected to join the Health Center COVID-19 Vaccine Program by the Biden Administration. This program ensures vaccines are being distributed to underserved communities and those most affected by the ongoing pandemic. I advocated strongly for Greater Baden to join this vaccine equity program, and I appreciated the opportunity to learn how the health center will use funds disbursed through the American Rescue Plan to keep Fifth District families safe and healthy.     Last Friday I was pleased to host two important virtual roundtable conversations to discuss how the American Rescue Plan will help students, educators, and small business owners in our state. I was first joined by education leaders from the Fifth District to discuss the struggles they face as we work to get our students back in the classroom safely. We discussed the critical funding made available through the American Rescue Plan, and how it will strengthen distance learning, prevent students from falling behind, and ensure our teachers have the resources they need to help our students succeed. Click here to watch our conversation.   Additionally, I was glad to host a conversation with Small Business Administration officials and small business owners to hear about the struggles our small businesses are facing as they continue to fight this pandemic and work to rebuild our economy back better. The American Rescue Plan provides critical resources, including additional PPP loans, to our small businesses to ensure they can stay open and keep workers on the payroll. Our small businesses are so important to our economy and must not be left out of recovery efforts. Click here to watch our conversation. If you are a small business owner, you can find options for small business relief here. 
As always, I encourage all Fifth District residents to continue to share their concerns and insights with me by contacting my office or connecting with me on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. If you are experiencing a personal difficulty such as issues accessing veterans benefits or another problem regarding a federal agency and you wish for my office to place an inquiry on your behalf, please complete the casework request form by clicking here.       
Sincerely Yours,   

Steny H. Hoyer

4/24/21 9:34,Supporting Commonsense Energy and Environment Initiatives,"Congressman Smith's E-news: April 24, 2021  


I recently met with Central Valley High School students in Washington. Although we are still using masks, we did remove them for the photograph. It was great meeting with these young Nebraskans. The return of school trips to D.C. demonstrates the progress we have made, and I look forward to visiting with more students from the Third District. 

Supporting Commonsense Energy and Environment Initiatives  
Nebraskans know how important it is to protect our environment, especially the farmers and ranchers across the Third District whose livelihoods are tied directly to the land they cultivate, the water they use to irrigate, and animals they raise. Across party lines it is clearly understood that there are ways we can address environmental concerns and improve access to the energy we need to fuel our economy. However, the government must not arbitrarily pick winners and losers or create new policy solely for messaging purposes. We need initiatives which make sense, are affordable to consumers, and do not incapacitate small businesses or agriculture. We must be smart and consider the practical implications before enacting policies in the environmental and energy space.   
 
Unfortunately, recent initiatives by the Biden Administration have prioritized far-left political messaging over finding workable solutions to protecting our planet for future generations. One prime example is President Biden’s “30 by 30” Executive Order, which created a goal of conserving at least 30% of the U.S.’s land and water by 2030 without presenting any scientific data or rationale for such an arbitrary target. Nebraskans know this will disproportionately impact Western rural communities since over 90% of land managed by the federal government is west of the Mississippi. This is concerning for landowners, farms, and communities who rely on land-based activities for recreation, energy, or food production.  
 
Another example of this overreach is President Biden’s executive order canceling the Keystone XL pipeline. Unilaterally canceling the Keystone XL, which was to receive more than $1 billion in investments and was projected to support 11,000 jobs in 2021, not only harmed our ability to move energy around our country, but undermined our nation’s reputation as a place which was safe for foreign investment because permitting decisions are based solely on strict adherence to the law. 
 
In order to make real change in the environment and energy sectors, we need bipartisan solutions that benefit both jobs and the economy, rather than crippling entire industry sectors. As a co-chair of the Biofuels Caucus, I supported the Renewable Fuel Infrastructure Investment and Market Expansion Act, a bill which would authorize a five year grant program through the United States Department of Agriculture to install new or convert existing fuel pump infrastructure to deliver ethanol and biodiesel blends. I have also sent several letters urging accountability of the administration to ensure they abide by the law regarding the Renewable Fuel Standard and small refinery exemptions. These actions save money for consumers and benefit the environment. 
 
The previous administration made headway with smart energy and land initiatives when they repealed the 2015 Obama era rule that expanded the definition of the Waters of the United States, or WOTUS, and released the “Navigable Waters of the U.S.” rule, which provided much-needed regulatory predictability and certainty for farmers by establishing clear and reasonable definitions of what qualifies as a “water of the United States.” Back in 2015 I introduced legislation to block the WOTUS rule, and this year I supported a resolution to uphold the Navigable Waters Protection Rule. Additionally, in accordance with the Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act, legislation I introduced, the previous administration approved year-round usage of E-15, a gasoline-ethanol blend. This act saves motorists money and boosts engine performance all while improving the environment. 
 
Nebraska is a biofuels powerhouse - the second and third largest producer of ethanol and corn in the country - supporting biofuels and ethanol options for consumers is crucial to ensuring that industry thrives outside of our state as well. There is no one solution to protecting land and the environment, but in Congress we must recognize it is an agenda that needs real action nationwide, but that action cannot stem from one political party or another. It is my hope we look for new ways to enhance energy and environmental initiatives while still supporting the workers and the farmers back home whose businesses rely on the environment. 

Reintroducing the PEERS Act
This week I introduced the PEERS in Medicare Act, with my colleague Rep. Judy Chu, to expand access to peer support specialists by providing their services for Medicare beneficiaries. Peer support therapy provides an opportunity for those with mental illnesses or who are recovering from substance abuse disorders to find support and assistance during their recovery. I am glad to sponsor this legislation once again and continue working on bettering mental health in our country.

Learn more here. 

Water Resources Development Act
I joined colleagues from the Lower Missouri basin writing to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers urging implementation of Missouri flood control provisions we included in WRDA 2020. We need to ensure proper water management throughout the system and better protect communities across the Third District from flooding.

Read the letter here. 

History and Tradition Protection Act 
I recently cosponsored this bill, H.R. 2229, to reduce the number of frivolous lawsuits filed under the Establishment Clause targeting traditional religious symbols and expression by removing any financial incentives for litigation. While plaintiffs are still able to bring lawsuits under the Establishment Clause, they could no longer seek monetary damages and attorney fees for lawsuits involving public buildings, official seals, flags, monuments, memorials, statues, or figures containing religious words, imagery, symbolism, or religious expression in the context of the proceedings of any deliberative body.
 
Iran Hostages Congressional Medal Act
I supported H.R. 1179 to award a Congressional Gold Medal to the 52 hostages held captive by Iran from 1979-1981, as this year marks the 40th anniversary of the release of the hostages. On November 4, 1979, fifty-two Americans were taken hostage from the US Embassy in Iran by militant supporters of the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in violation of international law. For the next 444 days, they were subjected to intense physical and psychological torture, including mock executions, beatings, solitary confinement, and inhospitable living conditions. Throughout their ordeal, the hostages showed unfathomable resilience, strength, and courage.

12/26/20 9:16,Good Riddance 2020,"December 26, 2020 
Dear Fellow Marylander:   This has been a roller coaster of a year – physically, mentally and emotionally.    More than 18.5 million Americans have been infected with COVID-19 and the list of related deaths stands at 326,000 and growing. Currently, we are losing more people in one day to COVID-19 than our nation lost on 9/11.    Tens of millions lost their livelihood and schools were transformed, seemingly overnight. Even with vaccines starting to reach frontline health care workers and others at risk, we have many more months of challenges to come before our nation, and the world, might emerge from the darkness of the current global pandemic.    We all have seen everyday moments and life events changed or canceled because of the precautions put in place to keep us safe from harm. Hugs have been postponed or replaced with elbow bumps and Zoom calls, which we all know really are not the same.    Next week, I will offer an overview of my policy priorities heading into the 117th Congress, which begins on January 3, 2021. For today, I want to share my personal priorities and what I hope for all Marylanders.   To start, I would like to see all of us rally around the idea that keeping each other safe and healthy is as important as keeping ourselves safe. Respect for others should replace selfishness as we keep up the basic steps we can take to remain safe: wear a mask, maintain six feet of space from people not in your household, and wash your hands frequently. Receiving the vaccine does not eliminate the need for these personal health measures, at least not yet, so keep at it.   I am hopeful that we can return to a level of what we might call “normal” at some point in 2021. For this to happen, it will take all of us following those basic steps to defeat this virus. We saw what happened this summer when we rushed ahead of the science. At the very moment we thought we were “flattening the curve” and breaking the first wave of infections, people grew lax and started to take liberties that we weren’t ready for. Super-spread events, including family gatherings, caused the trends to reverse themselves quickly. Yes, there were many who tried to say this pandemic was a hoax and walked right into risky situations. Most of those folks have learned better by now. Hopefully, the others will begin to understand the seriousness and act accordingly.    When we do find ourselves emerging from the weight of this pandemic, I hope we can keep up the spirit of neighbors helping neighbors. As more individuals and families found themselves vulnerable and wondering what their next meal might be or if they were going to be able to pay the rent, others who were in more stable positions stepped up to provide community support. Our nonprofits and faith groups, as well as local governments and school systems, expanded the safety net to provide meals and groceries to a wider universe of those in need. Even the federal government made it easier for families to get assistance.    Like you, I am looking forward to the day when we can safely enjoy a meal at a cozy restaurant or have friends and family over for a celebration without fear. I’d like to be on the sidelines cheering at my granddaughter’s lacrosse game again without wondering if I was standing too close to others. Zoom Thanksgiving and Zoom funerals can happily stay in 2020, although, admittedly, these events did bring together people from far distances who may not have otherwise been able to gather in person pre-COVID.    Life will be different post-COVID. We aren’t there yet, but as we reach the end of a life-altering 2020, I would ask you to think about how you were forced to do things differently this year. What worked better than you thought it would and what would you want to do more of in the future? Consider what we all can do better and what absolutely should end. All of us, working together and as individuals, can move us forward to a place where the good grows stronger, the system changes to expand opportunities where some may have never existed, and the bad fades into the background.    For those who have experienced pain and loss over the last year, I grieve with you and hope 2021 brings you comfort and healing.    Thank you to all who have contributed to keeping our communities safer and helped others get through these very tough times.    Together, we can say good riddance to 2020 and welcome to 2021!

2/28/21 11:46,Black History Month — Understanding Our History and Fighting for a Better Future,"Understanding Our History and Fighting for a Better Future
  
On the last day of Black History Month, I implore each of us to continue learning. Black History IS American history. Let us commit to learning the true history of our nation, and to celebrating the contributions of Black Americans every day — every month of the year. 
As February ends, I’d like to honor the experiences of Black Vermonters and share just a few stories about the work they are doing to make Vermont a welcoming place for all. 
 
Land Access is a Social Justice Issue: The Fight to Preserve Black Farm Ownership in America
  
In 1910, Black farmers made up 14% of all farmers in the United States. Today, Black farmers account for fewer than 2% of U.S. farmers and own less than 1% of all American farmland. 
I encourage all Vermonters to learn about the history of land ownership in our country. In the video below, hear about the work being done in Vermont and the larger New England region to preserve and increase African American farm ownership and celebrate Black heritage. You can also find the video here. 

This month I entered a statement into the Congressional Record — the official archive of the U.S. Congress — honoring the work of the Clemmons Family Farm, which is located in Charlotte, VT. Read the full statement here. 

 
Vermont Students Demanding Justice
  
I stand with students of the South Burlington School District and all Vermonters who are demanding justice and an end to the horrors of systemic racism. Read VT Digger’s article on the raising of the Black Lives Matter flag at South Burlington Middle school here. 

 
Helping Families of Color Access Food During the COVID-19 Pandemic
  
Before the pandemic, Black Americans experienced hunger at more than twice the rate of white Americans — and we know due to the COVID-19 crisis that more families than ever before are struggling to put food on the table. 
After seeing so many struggle to afford healthy food, the Susu Community Farm started a free CSA program for families of color in Windham County, VT. Learn about the program, their mission to provide safe spaces for people color, and their plans to buy farmland in the video below. You can also view the video here.  

 
Ensuring ALL Our People Have Access to Vital COVID-19 Information
  
It is critically important that all Vermonters have information on coronavirus prevention, treatment, test sites, and vaccine registration. The Vermont Health Department, in partnership with the Vermont Multilingual Task Force, has created translated materials and videos so that all Vermont families remain informed of the latest public health updates. You can find the translated materials on the Health Department site here. 
I’m very glad to see that community groups are also finding creative ways to help disseminate coronavirus information. The Afro- folk jazz group, KeruBo, recently released a song to encourage Vermont’s African families to learn more about the COVID-19 vaccine. Read an interview with the group’s lead vocalist here, and watch the music video below, or here. 

 
I believe if we all do the necessary work to understand our nation’s stories of achievement and progress, of joy and suffering, then together we can create a better future. 
In the year since we last celebrated Black History Month, we have experienced an unprecedented health and economic crisis that has both highlighted and worsened our country’s disparities. To state it plainly, Black Americans and communities of color have experienced immense suffering and pain over the last twelve months. Even here in Vermont, where we have responded to the pandemic better than nearly any other state in the nation, we have still seen disproportionately worse rates of COVID infection and death among Black Vermonters. As we reflect on what Black History Month means for us as a nation, we must take time to celebrate the many joyful stories and rich history of the Black community, while also acknowledging the devastating realities of systemic racism, struggle for equality and equity, and the immense amount of work before us. 
I am hopeful that if we are truly committed to creating a more just society, we will educate ourselves and actively work to create anti-racist communities every day. And that means tomorrow — when it is no longer Black History Month — the work continues. 

 
How Can We Help? 
My Burlington office has a team of experienced caseworkers who help Vermonters navigate federal agencies every day. If you think my office can help you, please do not hesitate to call 1-800-339-9834 or (802) 862-0697, or click here.

5/26/21 12:34,Winning the Future with Autonomous Vehicles,"Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, many of us experienced isolation as restrictions and lockdowns limited where we could go and what we could do. Sadly, many seniors and individuals with disabilities face similar challenges every single day, even when we aren’t in the middle of a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. The reality is that many in our communities and across the country find their mobility limited through no fault of their own, whether it be the result of old age, a physical disability, or any other obstacle. 

As Lead Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee, I am committed to solving this issue by embracing new technologies that can help individuals unleash their full potential. Last week, our committee held a hearing on advancing America’s autonomous vehicle industry. 


The idea that someone with a disability could one day be able to get into a car and go wherever they need to go is revolutionary.  Autonomous vehicle technology has the power to tremendously improve access and mobility, and we are already seeing the potential benefits. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we’ve witnessed how AVs can be used to deliver critical food, medical supplies, virus tests, and other needed provisions. 
 
Many of the adjustments we will need to make in order to use autonomous vehicle technology will be challenging, but they will be more challenging if the U.S. is not forging the path and leading the way. As Americans, we value the importance of the safety of our citizens, workforce, and free market economics – China does not. We cannot trust the Chinese Communist Party to set the standards for this industry and we certainly cannot trust them to protect intellectual property and individual rights. 

To win the future, the U.S. must continue to lead on advancing the autonomous vehicle industry. If we do not lead, we will empower our adversaries to chart the future for AVs, artificial intelligence, and other critical and emerging technologies. We must chart the path so all of these considerations can be part of a road we design, not determined by an adversary that does not respect our ideals and values.

I am thrilled to hear the news that the first ever Recognizing Inspiring School Employees (RISE) award has been presented to Walla Walla High School’s very own, Melito Ramirez! Our community could not be more proud of your accomplishments and dedication to the next generation. Way to go, Melito!  

Watch the award announcement here.  



Last week, I asked whether or not you think Congress should invest in expanding broadband across Eastern Washington. The results are in, and an overwhelming 81% of you believe expanding rural broadband will help close the digital divide. I agree! That’s why I recently introduced the American Broadband Act to ensure everyone in Eastern Washington has access to reliable, affordable broadband.  

Right now, far too many individuals, families, and businesses in Eastern Washington lack access to reliable broadband. This has been especially devastating for countless families during the pandemic. Many children have lost an entire school year and counting with no access to remote learning tools. For some parents, unreliable connection at home meant forgoing work to spend hours driving around looking for internet they and their children could connect to.  

The American Broadband Act will unleash economic opportunities for everyone – from small business owners to entrepreneurs to working moms – by targeting resources to rural and unserved areas, removing barriers to deployment, streamlining permitting processes, and unleashing private investment.  

This legislation builds on the progress we’ve made to improve the broadband mapping process by ensuring we target and invest our resources into rural and unserved communities. The people of Eastern Washington need reliable, affordable access to broadband, and this bill will help deliver real results for those who need it most.

Q: Why did you vote against establishing the January 6 Commission? - Kathy from Spokane 

A: Thanks for your question. The events that took place in our nation’s capital on January 6th were disgraceful and un-American. The criminals who breached and defaced our Capitol Building not only put people’s lives in danger, but they threatened the very values we hold dear as Americans. 
Thanks to the Department of Justice – and the incredible work of state and local law enforcement – 445 people responsible for this assault have been arrested. More arrests are expected in the coming weeks and months, and I fully support prosecuting every individual who acted illegally to the fullest extent of the law. 

Unfortunately, the commission established in H.R. 3233 could impede the ongoing investigation of these events and delay the prosecution of those responsible by unnecessarily duplicating efforts.

The bill also fails to provide an avenue for examining the violence that swept across the nation last summer as rioters looted cities like Seattle and Portland, events that cannot be ignored as we assess the factors that led to an attack on our democracy. 

Instead, we must unite as Americans to condemn all violence and strive to hold accountable those who commit these shameful acts. We are Americans, and we are better than this. I pray that we can come together as ‘one nation under God’ and move forward to build a brighter future.

In March, I asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg if he acknowledged a connection between children's declining mental health and social media platforms.  

His response? ""I don't think that the research is conclusive on that.”

Researchers disagree. Parents and children in Eastern Washington deserve better.

Leading NEPA to Economic Vitality
 
  
Dear Lindsey,
 
One of my top goals in Washington is to ensure Northeastern Pennsylvania has the support it needs to recover from the pandemic and achieve long-term economic vitality. 
 
On the Appropriations Committee last week, I chaired a hearing with the U.S. Economic Development Administration, and joined another with the Department of Interior. I was happy to hear that the administration is committed to partnering with me to help Northeastern Pennsylvania recover and grow.
 
Watch clips of the hearings:

Building Sustainable Jobs & Infrastructure
 
  
In just the last decade, our Commonwealth has experienced 37 extreme weather events, costing up t0 $10 billion to repair our infrastructure and help our communities recover. 
 
As we gear up for the largest infrastructure investments in a generation with the American Jobs Plan, it’s critical that we build infrastructure strong enough to withstand ever-intensifying extreme weather while creating jobs that are here to stay. 
 
To mark Earth Day last week, I introduced three bills to help communities like Northeastern Pennsylvania build sustainable jobs and infrastructure while saving taxpayer money. Click below to learn how.
  

  
 
COVID-19 Vaccine Dashboard Milestone: 200 Million+ Shots in Arms
 
  
Last week, our nation hit a milestone: 200 million COVID-19 shots administered. Nationwide, nearly 140 million Americans have received at least one dose. Thanks to resources provided by the American Rescue Plan we passed in Congress, we're getting shots in arms faster than we ever thought possible. Many thanks to the scientists, health care workers and all the Americans who are helping our nation crush this virus and begin recovering. 
 
If you haven't received your vaccine, wait no longer. Find a provider near you.
  

  
Be safe and well,

Weekly Wrap-Up with 
Congressman Byron Donalds
May 24, 2021
 
 
I spent last week advocating for the values of Southwest Florida in Washington, D.C., as the House of Representatives resumed Session. 
 
As our closest ally in the Middle East, and one of our strongest allies worldwide, Israel, continues to defend itself from rockets coming from Hamas, I stand proudly in support of Israel. But, unfortunately, we have also seen a rise in antisemitic atrocities committed against American Jews at home, which is a direct result of the antisemitic rhetoric of pro-Palestinian advocates in power. There is no room for hate in America, and we must come together and support freedom, democracy, and peace at home and around the globe.  
 
This week, I also stood with my colleagues of the Republican Study Committee in introducing our conservative and fiscally sound balanced budget. This RSC budget slashes $1.9 trillion, makes much-needed reforms to Medicaid, balances the budget in five years, cuts spending by more than $14 trillion, and much more. Lastly, I took part in a House Small Business Subcommittee hearing on Economic Growth, Tax, and Capital Access entitles, “Examining the Role of Community Development Financial Institutions and Minority Depository Institutions in Small Business Lending.”  
 
This past week, May 16 - 22, was National EMS Week. The week honors and recognizes those who provide front-line emergency services to communities around the nation. Today and every day, we celebrate their service and sacrifice while saving countless lives.  
 
Please continue reading for a legislative update from my office, events within the Southwest Florida community, and for the most up-to-date guide on what’s happening on Capitol Hill! 
 

 
 
Legislative Updates
 
As a proud member of the Republican Study Committee (RSC), the largest Republican caucus in Congress dedicated to formulating and passing conservative measures, announced its proposed 2021 Budget this past week. Since taking the majority three years ago, Speaker Nancy Pelosi is 0/3 for introducing a federal budget. The newly proposed RSC Budget streamlines the federal budget, cuts over $14 trillion in wasteful government spending, balances our budget in five years and cuts taxes by over $1.9 trillion. This budget brings common sense back to Washington and prioritizes the American taxpayer. For more information on the Republican Study Committee's proposed 2021 Budget, click below:

This past week, House Republicans hosted a Tax Camp to brief Republican representatives on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was passed into law under former President Trump and the long-term financial consequences Americans will face if Democrats succeed in untangling the law. Afterward, myself and several Republican members spoke to the press regarding the brief and how beneficial this tax reform is to middle-class Americans. Watch my full speech below: 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
Community Engagement
 
On May 22nd, I was honored to participate in Cape Coral's National Maritime Day Ceremony, which honors and celebrates our nation's Merchant Marines. I was also awarded the opportunity to present the Convoy Cup, which recognizes the historical contribution of the Port of Halifax to the convoy lifeline to Europe during WWII, and perpetuates the memory of the courageous men and women of the Merchant Marines. 
 
 


 
 

 
Today, May 24th, I am hosting a Veterans Town Hall. This event serves as an opportunity for Southwest Florida veterans to receive a Congressional update, learn about available federal resources, and allows me to hear directly from my veteran constituents on ways Congress can best serve our veteran community.  For more information on tonight's Veterans Town Hall, visit my website: 
 
Rep. Donalds Hosts Veterans Town Hall 
 

 
Last week, my team and I held a virtual meeting with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and Colonel Andrew Kelly to discuss harmful algal blooms, how we can work together to ensure clean water not just in Southwest Florida, but throughout the entire state, and more. 
 
I appreciate Col. Kelly's time to hear my priorities and his years of service tp our nation and the state of Florida.

Standing with Israel
 
Each and every day it is we as a nation must reaffirm our steadfast commitment to Israel- our strongest ally in the Middle East. Especially during a time when Members of Congress are actively supporting the terrorists launching bombs into their country. As the sole democratic country that represents freedom in the Middle East, I will always Stand With Israel. 
 
 


 

Serving the hardworking men and women of Florida's 19th Congressional District is my distinct honor and privilege. It's time Washington works for our community's values, and every day I will always strive to ensure your government is working for you. 
 
Sincerely, 
 


Byron Donalds Member of Congress

VACCINES FOR COLORADO VETERANS

Currently, Veterans enrolled with VA health care and who are 70 years and older or a frontline essential worker are eligible to receive a COVID vaccine. Veterans should receive a text message prompting you to schedule your COVID-19 vaccine appointment as appointments become available. Eligible Veterans can also call (888) 336-8262 to schedule a time to receive their vaccine. Please be advised that there will be a wait time when contacting the call center and callers should remain patient.

The Rocky Mountain Regional VA Medical Center plans to hold vaccine clinics on February 8, 9, 10, 11, 16 and 25. Click here for up-to-date information and additional resources.

UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

This week, claimants were once again able to apply for federal benefits through the Colorado Department of Labor & Employment. These benefits, made available through the COVID relief package passed in December, will be done in phases. Phase I will include anyone who still had payable weeks left on their PUA and PEUC. In addition, the weekly $300 supplement will start going out to these folks and anyone on regular unemployment. To determine if you have a remaining balance, log onto your MyUI+ account. 

We understand call center wait times are long and many of you are still experiencing issues with your benefits. We are here to try and help as best we can.

NEW OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD

In an effort to help Americans who have lost their health insurance coverage due to the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, President Biden recently issued an executive order reopening the enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act to help expand access to health insurance during this public health emergency. No one should be denied access to health insurance during a public health emergency, and I’m glad to see President Biden take action to ensure more Americans have access to sign up for health care coverage.

Connect for Health Colorado, Colorado’s health exchange marketplace, will re-open enrollment for Coloradans beginning February 8th through May 15th. Coverage will begin on the first day of the month following enrollment, for instance if you enroll in February your coverage will begin March 1st. 

Connect for Health Colorado offers individuals and families a one-stop-shop to compare policies, sign up for high-quality, affordable health insurance, and receive financial assistance. For more information or to enroll, visit connectforhealthco.com or call (855) 752-6749. 


STOCK MARKET VOLATILITY

For millions of hardworking Americans, the stock market is a vehicle for growing savings for retirement, to send kids to college, or to save up for a down payment on a home. But the foundation of an efficient market is rooted in fairness— that all investors play by the same set of rules and have access to the same information. The recent events surrounding GameStop has resulted in increased market volatility and trading volume over the last few weeks, leading to several brokerage platforms suspending or restricting purchases of shares of GameStop and other volatile stocks. 



My biggest concern in this scenario is with the small investors and constituents who had the rules changed on them late in the game and who were left holding the bag. Congress needs to investigate the transactions and sequence of events to better understand what exactly happened, and if retail investors were treated unfairly. The House Financial Services Committee, of which I’m a member, plans to hold a hearing on the issue on February 18th. I look forward to asking questions during the hearing and working to ensure we prevent small investors from getting hurt in the future.

If you have questions or concerns, please contact the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy at 1-800-732-0330 or email them at Help@SEC.gov.


LOCAL HEROES

While United States Capitol Police Officer Brian D. Sicknick is not from Colorado, this week we honored him as he lied in honor in the U.S. Capitol for his heroic actions during the January 6th attack. Officer Sicknick exemplified the bravery and self-sacrifice that so many members of our law enforcement demonstrate every day as they protect our communities and our country. Thank you Officer Sicknick for your service to our country, and my deepest sympathies go out to your fellow officers, friends and family.

My friend and colleague, Rep. French Hill (R-AR) and I introduced a resolution to honor the service of USCP officers on Jan. 6, including Officer Sicknick who is only the fourth USCP officer in history to be killed in the line of duty. 

I also want to recognize and honor Laura Schwartzenberger, an FBI agent and Colorado native who was killed while executing a federal search warrant in Sunrise, Florida this week.

And we can’t forget the critical role of National Guard members this past year as troops were deployed across the country to work on the frontlines against the deadly COVID-19 virus. In Colorado, the Guard assisted in administering more than 110,000 COVID 19 tests in more than 28 Colorado counties, served as logisticians for PPE warehousing, packaging, and distribution to designated community organizations, and augmented more than 13 local emergency operation centers around Colorado. The Colorado National Guard’s COVID-19 mission is now the largest and longest activation of the National Guard in our state’s history.

I was glad I could help a National Guardsman from Delaware become a U.S. citizen as a small token of my appreciation for all the National Guard troops coming to the aid and defense of our country.



While we live in a divisive and chaotic time, our country can come together through shared values including honoring and appreciating those who put country first, no matter the price. A grateful Congressman and nation thanks you.

2/27/21 10:03,Weekly Update: COVID Relief Hijacked by Partisan Politics,"Weekly Update | February 27, 2021
 

COVID Relief Hijacked by Partisan Politics

Today the Democrats’ partisan COVID relief bill passed the House. This action followed their repeated rejection of efforts to advance bipartisan solutions that are targeted, temporary, and tied to COVID relief.
﻿
Read More About My Vote on This Bill Here

President Biden campaigned on bipartisanship and pledged to lead the country in a unifying way. It is clear he does not intend to keep that promise. I believe both parties have an obligation to our constituents to work together and find common ground. This bill should've been negotiated in a bipartisan manner, but hundreds of Republican amendments were shut down at every turn. Federal aid needs to be targeted to those in need and spent immediately. That’s not what this bill does. Vast sums aren’t pandemic related and won’t be spent for years. I support strengthening our vaccine program, helping our kids get back in school and providing relief to those families and businesses who need it most.

Clearly, this legislation has more to do with politics than providing relief to the American people. We have already appropriated $4 trillion and $1 trillion of that has yet to be spent. Those remaining funds are ready to be used for vaccine distribution, school reopenings and helping those in need. This nearly $2 trillion package is aimed more at pleasing the far left progressive wing of the Democratic party than it is targeted towards defeating the virus. And while Congress should be working to lower unemployment the CBO says policies in this bill would put an additional 1.4 million Americans out of work. It's unfortunate that politics, for the first time, has gotten in the way of helping people recover from this pandemic.

Hearing on H.R. 1: The Largest Expansion of the Federal Government's Role in Our Elections

As the Ranking Member of the Committee on House Administration which oversees federal elections I delivered the opening statement below at a hearing on H.R. 1 (the Democrats' elections bill) this week. My remarks focused on the federal election mandates, public funding of campaigns and attacks on the First Amendment within H.R. 1.

The hearing revealed the legislation is unworkable for election administrators, violates free speech and publicly funds congressional campaigns. The bill is scheduled to be on the floor next week without going through a markup where amendments could be offered.

More Important Updates

Visiting with Students in Nokomis and Celebrating National FFA Week
 

Last week I enjoyed visiting with students at Nokomis North Elementary and answering their questions. Principal Reedy and I discussed the Coronavirus precautions they are taking to safely hold class in-person. Recently I met with K-12 administrators from across my district and was glad to hear that most all are holding some in-person instruction and a large amount are fully in-person 5 days a week. Our kids deserve the best learning environment we can give them which is undoubtedly the classroom. 

Also related to students, I was proud to cosponsor a resolution in Congress this week designating February 20th through the 27th as National FFA Week. The thousands of high school students who celebrated across Illinois this week are the future of agriculture. As a member of the House Ag Committee I wish them all the success in the world as they prepare themselves to feed and fuel us for years to come. 
 

Announcing the ""All-American Road"" Designation for the Great River Road
 

The #GreatRiverRoad in Illinois now has the distinction of being an ""All-American Road"" after being designated as such by the U.S. Department of Transportation. This designation will bring more regional and national attention to the byway which should increase tourism activity that supports many communities I serve. I look forward to driving along the river soon knowing I'm on a roadway recognized for its historic and cultural importance.

Commemorating Montgomery County's Bicentennial
 

Click here or the image above to watch my remarks. 

I recently commemorated the bicentennial of the founding of Montgomery County, Illinois on the House floor. The county was formed February 12th, 1821 and named in honor of Revolutionary War General Richard Montgomery who gave his life for American independence.

Montgomery County has a rich history including being a friend to Illinois’ favorite son, President Abraham Lincoln. He made frequent visits when he represented the community in the Illinois legislature. 

Congratulations to the citizens of Montgomery County on their home’s bicentennial. They are the ones who make the county a great place to live and I am proud to represent them in Congress.

Launching the Congressional Colorectal Cancer Caucus
 

My colleague Congressman Donald M. Payne, Jr. and I launched the Congressional Colorectal Cancer Caucus this week to raise awareness and advocate for legislation to combat this horrible disease. 

Fighting colorectal cancer and reducing its incidence is personal to me. At the age of 26 my wife was diagnosed with a genetic form of cancer, Lynch syndrome, that could affect our kids, and we’re fortunate that she was able to receive treatment that saved her life. Colorectal cancer is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death among men and women combined in the U.S., and those deaths are preventable.

Davis, Payne Launch Congressional Colorectal Cancer Caucus
 

Introducing the CONTRACT Act
 

On Thursday I joined my colleague Congresswoman Julia Brownley to introduce the CONTRACT Act of 2021 to help FAA Contract Towers hire and retain air traffic controllers. In IL-13 this would help the Decatur Airport, Central Illinois Regional Airport in Bloomington and St. Louis Regional Airport in Bethalto maintain safe airways. Ensuring contract towers are adequately staffed is critical to their ability to maintain safety and continue operations. Additionally, these airports are often integral parts of the local economy and any reduction in controller capacity could have a negative economic impact. 

Davis, Brownley Introduce CONTRACT Act to Support Air Traffic Controllers
 


Introducing the PREPARED Act
 

On Friday Congresswoman Dina Titus and I introduced the PREPARED Act to protect animals during disasters. The bill would require entities regulated under the Animal Welfare Act – such as zoos, commercial animal dealers, and research facilities – to have contingency plans in place to safely evacuate and care for animals in an emergency or disaster situation. 

When natural disasters strike animals are put in danger the same as people and property which is why it is imperative those caring for them have an emergency plan in place.

Our bill is backed by the ASPCA, Humane Society Legislative Fund, The Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the Animal Welfare Institute.

With nearly 1,100 lives lost to COVID-19 in New Hampshire and individuals and small businesses facing unprecedented financial challenges, Congress must provide people with additional relief.   This week, we took an important step forward when we passed the outline of an another relief package. Now as we get to work finalizing the details, I am focused on bolstering public health and vaccine distribution efforts, delivering economic relief for individuals and small businesses, providing aid to our schools as they work to reopen safely, and providing resources for state and local governments as they work to combat the pandemic and avert further layoffs.   Communities in New Hampshire and across the country need this additional support – and we must get this done.   In addition, this week, I was thrilled to join the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs.   As the daughter of a World War II veteran, it is my great honor to join this Committee and have the opportunity to build on my bipartisan efforts to get veterans the care and support that they need and have earned. Throughout my career in public service, I have focused on expanding opportunity and strengthening care for veterans, while working to build a country that is ever-worthy of their service.  I am eager to partner with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle as a member of the Committee to make a real difference in the lives of veterans in New Hampshire and across the country. 
With every good wish,     Senator Maggie Hassan 
What the Senator is Working On
Senator Hassan is leading a bipartisan, bicameral effort to strengthen the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Solid Start program, which aims to contact every veteran multiple times by phone in the first year after they leave active duty to check in and help connect them to VA programs and benefits. Learn more here.  Senator Hassan joined colleagues in reintroducing the Paycheck Fairness Act, legislation that would help eliminate the gender wage gap and guarantee that women can challenge pay discrimination and hold employers accountable. Read more here.  Senators Hassan and Shaheen called on Congressional leadership to provide specific relief to the restaurant and hospitality industries in the upcoming COVID-19 package. Read more here. 
Photo of the Week
On Wednesday, Senator Hassan paid her respects to Officer Brian Sicknick at the Capitol Rotunda. After the ceremony at the Capitol, Officer Sicknick was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery. Officer Sicknick died after being injured during the insurrection at the Capitol.

PRESIDENT BIDEN’S FIRST 100 DAYS

President Biden has made a habit of calling for bipartisanship and unity but doing just the opposite.
In his first 100 days in office, Biden has:
	•	Partnered with Speaker Pelosi to propose more than $6,000,000,000,000 – that’s six trillion dollars – in new government spending without any Republican input. 
	•	Plotted massive tax hikes that would destroy jobs and hurt families to pay for a progressive wish list. 
	•	Issued 41 executive orders – including 25 in just one week – to put liberal priorities ahead of the needs of the American people. 
	•	Proposed the Green New Deal disguised as an “infrastructure” plan that spends more on electric vehicles than on broadband and only 5 percent on roads and bridges. 
	•	Adopted immigration policies that have led to a humanitarian and national security crisis at the southern border. 
	•	Joined Democrats in Congress to propose a partisan power grab by packing the Supreme Court and imposing a federally-mandated election system on all 50 states.

These actions have further divided the country, deepened our fiscal crisis, and put our economic recovery in jeopardy.
Small businesses are struggling to hire workers because of enhanced unemployment benefits. Workers are bracing for job-killing taxes and regulations. Families are seeing rising prices at the gas pump and the grocery store.
It’s time for President Biden and Speaker Pelosi to set aside partisan rhetoric and radical policies and begin working with Republicans to solve our nation’s many challenges.
GETTING AMERICANS BACK TO WORK

Job creators shouldn’t have to compete with the federal government for workers.
But that’s exactly what’s happening in northern Indiana and across the country, and it’s hurting our economic recovery.
As WSBT reported this week, local businesses are struggling to hire workers because of the extra $300 per week in federal unemployment benefits. With these extra payments, many laid-off workers can make more on unemployment than they would earn by returning to work.
With safe and effective vaccines now available for free to everyone age 16 and older, we are closer than ever to putting COVID behind us. It’s time to get Americans back to work so we can fully rebuild our economy.
That’s why I helped introduce legislation to turn supplemental unemployment benefits into return-to-work bonuses – $1,200 for a full-time job and $600 for part-time – for unemployed workers who accept a job by July 1st.
I talked with WSBT about how this commonsense bill would help boost our economic recovery. Watch the full story here.
HELPING WORKING FAMILIES THRIVE

Two million women have left the labor force during the coronavirus crisis. Many remain unable to return to work, largely because they shoulder much of the burden of child care.
Working parents shouldn’t have to choose between financial security and taking care of their families. Making sure they have access to affordable child care – and better tools to pay for it – will be key to rebuilding our economy.
Families want child care and paid leave, but they don’t want smaller paychecks. Small businesses want to provide these benefits, but they can’t manage more Washington mandates and regulations.
This week I joined Independent Women’s Forum president Carrie Lukas for a Facebook Live discussion on finding smart, pro-growth, pro-family solutions.
You can watch our full conversation here.
I recently introduced the Working Families Childcare Access Act, which would expand and improve dependent care FSAs to give parents more flexibility to save their hard-earned money and use pretax dollars for a wide range of child care expenses. Learn more about the bill here.
As always, it is a privilege to represent 2nd District Hoosiers in Congress.

5/3/21 9:11,A Nation Divided Cannot Stand,"Dear Friends,
 
As we come closer to ending the pandemic, it's important to recognize the teams of doctors and researchers on Operation Warp Speed, the tens of thousands of patriotic Americans who participated in the clinical trials for our safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, and the previous administration's leadership in prioritizing vaccine development so early.
 
I continue to be inspired by all the doctors, nurses, and volunteers who are working tirelessly to vaccinate Americans. Getting vaccinated is one of the easiest ways to protect yourself, your family, and your community from COVID-19. If you have any questions, I recommend talking to your doctor to get all of the facts.
 
You can find more information about how to receive a vaccine here.

Casework

Need help with a federal agency, like Small Business or the VA? My team and I are here to help. Submit a casework request HERE and find our privacy release form for casework HERE. 

Committee Assignments



I'm excited to announce that this Congress I'll be serving on three committees: the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the House Small Business Committee, and the House Science, Space and Technology Committee. These committee assignments will allow California's 39th District to have a voice on several important policy issues. I also joined the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus and look forward to getting to work and delivering bipartisan results for my constituents. 

Visiting Orange County Super POD Vaccination Site


I visited the Disneyland Super POD vaccination site yesterday before the rain! Our health care workers, first responders & volunteers are working hard to get all eligible people COVID-19 vaccines in Orange County. I'll continue to work to expand vaccine access in our community. 

Vaccines are currently available for Los Angeles, Orange, and San Bernardino county residents ages 65+. Visit my website for more information HERE. 

Helping our Small Businesses


Our small businesses continue to face challenges during COVID-19. I visited Eureka Pizza in Yorba Linda to learn more about their experience. I look forward to fighting for our CA-39 small businesses on the House Small Business Committee & making sure they get the relief they deserve. If you're a small business in need of help, I encourage you to contact my office. We are here to help you. 

Supporting our Dockworkers

I wrote a letter to Governor Gavin Newsom, state health officials and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors 

The San Pedro Port Complex makes up a quarter of our nation’s total exports, 40% of containerized imports and processes $2 billion in goods each day. Slowdowns due to COVID-19 infections have already caused a bottleneck of dozens of ships filled with goods and supplies waiting to be unloaded. Further delays and terminal shutdowns will have a negative impact on our already fragile economy.

My team and I are here to serve you. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out to my office with any questions or concerns. I encourage you to follow me on social media on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram at @RepYoungKim.

Dear Friend,  
Happy Mother's Day! I hope you have a wonderful day surrounded by loved ones.
 
This week, I was proud to announce Gracie Hines from Webster County High School as the winner of this year's Congressional Art Competition for the Third District of West Virginia. I am so excited to see her beautiful work displayed in the United States Capitol for the next year. Congratulations Gracie!
 

 
I recently spoke with Bloomberg Businessweek about how West Virginia is shaping the energy debate in Washington. With our abundant natural resources and proud history of coal mining, our state has played a significant role in building modern America. I am committed to protecting West Virginia's energy industry against  radical policies that threaten our economy, jobs, and way of life. Instead, we must take an all-inclusive approach that encourages investment in innovative technologies and also supports our world renowned energy industry. 
 
Additionally, this week I joined the West Virginia delegation to send a letter to President Biden asking that he fulfill Governor Justice's request for a federal disaster declaration after the heavy rain and storms that led to flooding, landslides, and mudslides in late February and early March. This disaster declaration will unlock the crucial federal funding needed to help our state recover and prepare for future severe weather. I urge President Biden to approve this request.

Coronavirus Update: December 16th, 2020 
By The Numbers:  Statistics are current as of December 16th, 11:00 a.m. CT  
	•	In Texas, there are an estimated 1,352,489 active cases in our state, and there have been 23,565 deaths, as reported by the Texas Department of State Health Services.  
	◦	Tarrant County has at least 106,691 confirmed cases, the third-highest number of cases among Texas counties; Parker County has 5,407 confirmed cases; and Wise County has 2,655.  
	•	In the United States, there are at least 16,317,892 cases and 300,032 deaths, as reported by the CDC.
Need to Know: 
	•	Here’s what you need to know as the coronavirus vaccine heads your way. Last Friday, December 11th, the Food and Drug Administration issued the first emergency use authorization for a coronavirus vaccine, developed by Pfizer and German firm BioNTech, authorizing the vaccine for public use on people 16 years and older. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar has promised that the federal government will provide enough vaccines for 20 million Americans before the end of the year and estimates that there should be enough doses for all Americans by next spring —not only the Pfizer vaccine but also likely other vaccines that are currently in the pipeline. This Monday, December 14th, the first vaccine doses began to arrive in Texas, which is slated to receive 1.4 million doses this month alone—more than the total number of Texans who have tested positive for the virus. As outlined in the State of Texas’ vaccine distribution plan, frontline healthcare workers are first in line for the vaccine.
	◦	This week, shipments of the vaccine began to reach North Texas hospitals, and yesterday, December 15th, the first person in Tarrant County received the vaccine. By the end of this week, at least four major Fort Worth hospitals are scheduled to receive vaccine shipments, including Baylor Scott & White All Saints Medical Center and Texas Health Harris Methodist. Fort Worth’s own American Airlines is even part of the critical vaccine distribution effort, already transporting thousands of doses on flights as far as the Caribbean.
	•	Over the next few weeks, don’t let health and safety take a holiday too. Brighter days are ahead, but coronavirus cases are still currently rising in Texas, and the holiday season has already been associated with a rise in cases due to increased travel and less adherence to social distancing guidelines. Visit here for CDC recommendations for steps to safely protect yourself, your family, and community during the holidays.
	•	Free coronavirus tests are available in Fort Worth and Tarrant County throughout the holidays. The City of Fort Worth and Tarrant County have announced that they will continue to offer free coronavirus saliva testing through the holiday season, until January 8th, 2021. Click here to view times and locations. To locate a testing site anywhere in Texas, visit bit.ly/txcovidtest.

12/6/20 22:25,Weekly Wrap Up,"Dear Neighbor,
It has been another eventful week.  Here are some highlights from my week:


I have been in Washington this week where Congress has worked to pass vital year-end legislation and also worked to organize for the 117th Congress that begins in January.  I also had the privilege of presiding over the House of Representatives on Wednesday evening as Speaker Pro Tempore.
This week, the House of Representatives passed more than two dozen bills and resolutions.  Among them was House Resolution 17, expressing concern over the detention of Houstonian Austin Tice and requesting that the Department of State and the intelligence community continue to work with and inform Congress about efforts to secure his safe release and return from detention in Syria.  I was glad to co-sponsor this resolution led by my colleague Rep. Al Green, who has led the effort for many years to bring him home.  A veteran Marine Corps Captain who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, Tice was detained at a checkpoint near Damascus, Syria, on August 14, 2012 while working in the country as a freelance journalist.
The House also passed the Big Cat Public Safety Act, outlawing private ownership of big cats and working to end to the abuse of the cubs, which many members of our community have ask me to support, and which I was glad to co-sponsor. 


On Friday, the House passed the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement (MORE) Act, which will decriminalize cannabis possession and created a process to expunge the records of those convicted of non-violent marijuana possession in the past. 
In other news this week, I was glad to announce on Monday that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has approved the City of Jersey Village’s grant for $4.23 million for flood mitigation projects.  Following initial approval for federal funding for the Wall St. Drainage Improvements & Berm project, FEMA required a second review of the project, which would have caused delays and increased costs to the project.  I urged FEMA to approve the grant on the basis that any delays could risk lives and property of our neighbors in Jersey Village and was pleased to hear that the award had been granted.
I was so glad to hear at the end of the week that the Senate passed my bill to rename the post office at 315 Addicks Howell Road, the Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal Post Office Act, by unanimous consent.  Deputy Dhaliwal’s life of service to others, working for equality, connection, understanding, and community exemplifies the very best of our community.  I look forward to seeing the President sign this bill into law and to visiting the Deputy Sandeep Singh Dhaliwal Post Office.
Hurricane Season finally ended this week—on November 30—after a historic and active season with 31 named storms, more than a third of which made landfall.  This week also marked the 50th anniversary of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), established to protect our health and protect the environment around us.




Small businesses, and in particular, restaurants, have faced enormous challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Many restaurants in our community have weathered the storm by finding new ways to connect with customers, but it has not been without challenges.  Dining out is a way of life in Houston.  That's why I joined a bipartisan, bicameral letter with 163 of my colleagues this week urging leadership to pass the RESTAURANTS Act in order to revitalize the second largest private employer nationwide: the restaurant industry.
I also want to remind small businesses leaders of all kinds that my office is here to help if you need assistance working with the Small Business Administration.  Earlier this year, we assembled a Small Business Resource Guide to help navigate the EIDL and PPP systems, and have kept it up to date with new developments.




	•	Medicare: The deadline for Medicare Open Enrollment is tomorrow: Monday, December 7. Learn more about Medicare and consider your coverage needs for 2021 here.
	•	ACA Marketplace: Those who need to sign up or change their ACA coverage have until next Tuesday, December 15, to do so. Start the process here.
	•	Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL): The final day to apply for a COVID-19 EIDL is December 31, 2020. Start the application process before the holidays.




We remain at Harris County’s Threat Level 1: Stay At Home.  As the country and our community await a COVID-19 vaccine, it is still important to remain vigilant about mask use and staying home when possible.  Since I last wrote to you, positive cases in Texas have risen from 12.83% to 14.68% of those people who have been tested.  It’s a good idea to get tested, and testing is available for free.  Please use this page to find a Harris County or City of Houston testing site.

Click to see detail.

I am grateful to all those in our community who are doing their part to stop the spread and keep our community healthy, from medical health professionals on the frontlines in hospitals and clinics, to the family members caring for loved ones as they fight and recuperate from COVID-19, to those who make sure to #MaskUp when they leave home.  It has been tough, but I know Houstonians are used to taking on big challenges—and we do that best when we face them together.
 I’ll be in Washington again this week to vote on additional legislation, including National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 and, hopefully, appropriations to fund the government and several other bills of importance to our district. 
I will report back on progress next week.  If you have any questions or concerns before them, please contact me at (713) 353-8680 or email me here.  I look forward to hearing from you!
 Best wishes,

2/1/21 7:23,Senator King's Monthly e-Newsletter: January 2021 Recap,"Of the People, By the People, and For the People

For nearly a quarter of a millennium, American government of the people, by the people, for the people has endured – and we have witnessed the peaceful transfer of power that makes us unique in world history. This lasting success was not pre-ordained; our fledgling experiment in self-government has had to contend with wars and diseases, economic depressions and internal divisions. Through it all, the flame of democracy was protected by generations of patriots, public servants, and everyday citizens who put the long-term health of the nation ahead of short-term personal gain. Now, it is our turn to do the same.
Our nation is facing immense challenges. A pandemic that has already killed over 400,000 Americans, and still grows worse by the day. A floundering economy that is forcing too many Americans to make unimaginable choices. A divided nation, where a few conflict-seeking voices on the fringes seem to drown out the majority who long for compromise. In the middle of these crises and more, we cannot simply settle into business-as-usual.

At this urgent juncture, I find myself turning to the words of one of our nation’s greatest citizens. As President Abraham Lincoln worked to preserve the Union during its most delicate time, he urged Congress to rise to the moment, stating: ‘The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.'
More than 150 years later, it’s impossible to summarize this moment in American history, or the proper response, any better than Lincoln did. It’s time to think anew, and act anew, because we cannot allow our usual petty squabbles to hinder our response to the threats we face. I believe that President Biden has the opportunity, the ability, and the character to unify our nation and make this government work for its people. Now, Congress must do its part, and come together on a bipartisan basis to improve the country we all love so dearly. As President Lincoln said: it’s time to rise with the occasion.

'An American Independent’: Maine Values on Display on 60 Minutes 

(via @anguskingmaine on Instagram) 
Just before Christmas, a “60 Minutes” crew from CBS came to Brunswick to talk about the state of our politics, how to make the Senate work better, and what’s so special about Maine. The second part of the interview was to take place in Washington sometime after the new year—and turned out to be the morning after the insurrection at the Capitol.

I won’t try to recount the content we discussed, but wanted to share a little of what this experience was like. First, they had done their homework, even going back to my not-so-illustrious career in high school football, what it was like to be an Independent Governor, a lot about Joshua Chamberlain (which didn’t make it into the 15 minutes), and why the Senate can’t seem to get much done. The nerve-wracking part of this process is that we talked for more than four hours, but I knew they were only going to use 15 minutes. So the question I wondered about leading up to Sunday night was, which 15 minutes? 

(via @anguskingmaine on Instagram) 
There’s no script for something like this—you just have to answer the questions. But what they chose to close out the show was a good summary of how I try to work, “We just have to keep ringing the bell of common sense.""
Here are a few other key quotes from the interview: 
	•	The President’s responsibility for the Capitol insurrection: ""Words have consequences, and the higher up you are on the hierarchy, the words have more and more consequences. And the President of the United States has the bully pulpit.""   
	•	Maine’s culture of community: ""If you’re in a small town and if you’re in a business, repeat business is all there is. You’ve got to, as we say up here, use people right, or they’re not gonna come back. That engenders a sense of community, and relationship, and sort of reciprocity of good will."" 
	•	On the merits of being an Independent in the Senate: ""It sort of liberates you, because you don’t have to do what the party says. You don’t have to worry about the party’s major contributors being mad at you. I just try to look for common sense solutions, what will work.  That’s what I’m interested in, rather than ideology.""

January 6th: Insurrection at the U.S. Capitol

(via @anguskingmaine on Instagram) 
I hate this picture but felt it should be shared. I walked up to the Capitol last week to thank the Maine National Guard detachment who had come down to help secure the Capitol after the riot on January 6–and for me, this shot captured the profound sadness of where we find ourselves as a country.
January 6th was one of the darkest days our democratic system has faced. Tomorrow, and every day after, must be better, because the freedoms enshrined by our founders are not self-perpetuating; their vision, and our Constitution requires each of us to put the long-term health of our nation above short-term political interests. If we are to ensure that government of the people, by the people, and for the people does not perish from the Earth, we need to protect it in word and deed. We must move forward together – not as warring factions, but as one nation.

Books could be written about what happened that day (and I’m sure they will be), but it comes down to our loss of consensus on what is true and a related loss of confidence in the sources of that truth. When I was young, everyone got their facts from one person—Walter Cronkite. We could argue about what do about those facts, but rarely about the facts themselves. Now facts and non-facts (a polite term for lies) come at us from all directions, and because human nature pushes us toward those sources we already tend to agree with (I’m told this is called “confirmation bias”), we dig ever further into our self-made information foxholes.
The result is a profoundly divided country that can’t even agree on who got more votes in an election. There’s plenty of blame to go around for this, beginning with those with large megaphones who deliberately misinform and mislead. But there will always be demagogues and charlatans (and Facebook and Twitter); the deeper cause is our failure to adapt to this new information-tsunami age. We have to become better consumers of news—more critical, more curious, more willing to take extra steps (like seeking a diversity of news sources) to get at the truth. The truth will indeed set us free, but these days we all have to work a little harder to find it.


January Legislative Update

	•	Joined a bipartisan group of Senators and the Administration to strategize on vaccine distribution throughout the U.S. Last week’s meeting was a cordial, bipartisan conversation focused on identifying the best policies to support the American people during this crisis. I’m hoping more congressional members will join our group as we all work together to get these vital resources to all Americans. Read more HERE.
	•	Voted to confirm President Biden’s nominees for key national security positions. I have confidence that with cabinet members like Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, and Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, the President will be well equipped to mitigate and prevent threats to our national security.
	•	Prepared the incoming Administration with guidance for cyberthreats. I serve as co-chair of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC) with Congressman Mike Gallagher (R-Wis), and last week we prepared a roadmap towards a stronger cyberdefense posture for the Biden Administration. Read more HERE.
	•	Recognized Maine’s strategic importance in the Arctic region. The U.S. Navy recently-released A Strategic Blueprint for the Arctic., a publication that represents a forward-thinking approach to achieving U.S. priorities in the Arctic, and stresses Maine’s critical strategic importance in the region. I sent a letter to top Navy officials to commend them for recognition of Maine’s leadership. Read more HERE.

Honoring Martin Luther King, Jr. 
On August 28, 1963, I sat perched in a tree (can you see me there, in the trees to the left of Dr. King?) on the National Mall and listened as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. told a crowd about his dream that one day, America would truly embody the idea that all people are created equal. His words still echo in my ears, all these years later. Dr. King spoke with clarity, passion, and unparalleled talent to remind all who would hear him of the American promise: it’s character that counts, not race, gender, religion, or national origin. His voice and his work inspired generations of Americans to recommit themselves to realize his dream. Including me. 

 However, recent years have reminded us all that the work is not finished. From the continued inequities in our criminal justice system that harm Black Americans to the widespread disparities that have made Black Americans far more likely to suffer the health and economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, it is clear that the dream Dr. King shared nearly 60 years ago has not been fulfilled.  Dr. King famously said that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. He’s right, of course – but that only happens if good people stand up, and fight to extend the American birthright of Equal Justice Under Law to all of our people. In the days ahead, we must summon his wisdom and his drive as Americans of all backgrounds continue to work together in pursuit of a more perfect union that truly guarantees liberty and justice for all.

January Edition of Inside Maine: Bipartisanship in the 117th Congress 

In the January 2021 edition of “Inside Maine” podcast, I welcomed U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) to discuss the importance of bipartisan legislating in the 117th Congress and how Congress can work together to provide vital coronavirus relief to the American people. 
The “Inside Maine Podcast” is a 30-minute program that aims to help keep Maine people informed about issues of the day, how they affect life in the state, and how they factor into my work as one of two independents in the U.S. Senate. This podcast builds on an existing radio show that airs on Newsradio WGAN in Portland, Maine between 10 and 11 a.m. on almost every last Saturday of the month. The link to the January podcast can be found HERE.

The sad fact is that many places in West Virginia simply do not have access to reliable broadband and the lack of access affects West Virginians every day. Back in 2015, the FCC released a coverage map that stated 99.9% of Americans had wireless coverage. I knew then what I know now: That is just plain wrong.

SENATE OVERWHELMINGLY PASSES BIPARTISAN MANCHIN, COLLINS AMENDMENT TO TARGET CHECKS TO THOSE WHO NEED ASSISTANCE  Washington, DC – Today, by an overwhelming vote of 99-1, the Senate passed an amendment to the budget resolution introduced by U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Susan Collins (R-ME) to target stimulus checks to families who need assistance as opposed to upper-income taxpayers. Senators Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Rob Portman (R-OH), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Jon Tester (D-MT), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Mark Warner (D-VA), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Angus King (I-ME), Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Mark Kelly (D-AZ) cosponsored the amendment.  ""American families in every corner of our country are struggling right now. Instead of sending stimulus checks to families who earn $300,000 a year we should be targeting this relief to families and individuals who need it most. For those who are struggling to pay rent or to put food on the table this $1,400 will make a significant impact on their ability to get by. These families need our support right now,"" said Senator Manchin. 
MANCHIN APPLAUDS NEW CONTRACT FOR FAIRMONT NOAA FACILITY   Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) applauded the new National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) contract with L3Harris to install equipment at the NOAA Consolidated Backup Facility (CBU) in Fairmont for an upcoming Space Weather Follow On-Lagrange 1 (SWFO-L1) Command and Control project.   “I am pleased that Fairmont’s NOAA facility is partnering with L3Harris to install new equipment in advance of the launch of the Space Weather Follow On-Lagrange 1 (SWFO-L1) Command and Control project. The Fairmont CBU facility will play a vital role in the launch of NOAA’s new project and I applaud the men and women at the facility for continuing their important work to help predict our climate and weather. NOAA’s continued investment in our workforce is great news for the Fairmont community and the entire state and I will continue to work with our local, state and federal partners to bring more investments to the state."" 
MANCHIN, CAPITO ANNOUNCE $3.5 MILLION FOR RALEIGH COUNTY AIRPORT INDUSTRIAL PARK  Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced the Raleigh County Memorial Airport Industrial Park will receive $3.5 million award from the U.S Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration (EDA) and the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC). The $8.3 million project will also receive $4.8 million in funding from state, local and private sources. The Raleigh County Memorial Airport Industrial Park project will grade 105 acres of land, construct an access road, and install water and sewer infrastructure to create land that is primed for commercial and industrial development.  ""In 2019, I invited ARC Co-Chair Tim Thomas to visit West Virginia to see for himself the impact ARC awards have on our economic growth and job creation across the state. During Tim’s trip, we had the opportunity to visit with project stakeholders and over a year after our visit, I’m pleased to announce the Raleigh County Memorial Airport Industrial Park project will receive $3.5 million from the ARC and EDA to develop more sorely needed investment ready sites for the region. This project will give Southern West Virginia an opportunity to diversify the economy and workforce by attracting new investments in the aerospace and aviation sectors. These investments will create new good-paying jobs for our fellow West Virginians and I look forward to the growth it will bring to our state,"" said Senator Manchin. 
MANCHIN, CAPITO ANNOUNCE $5.9 MILLION FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES IN WEST VIRGINIA  Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $5,921,559 in Mental Health & Substance Abuse Service Grants to two locations in West Virginia. Of the $5,921,559 provided, $2,000,000 will be granted to West Virginia Department of Health and Human Services to help battle the rise in opioid abuse during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the remaining $3,921,559 will be provided to Prestera Center for Mental Health Services in Huntington for service expansion. This funding is made available by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  ""The COVID-19 pandemic has put an enormous strain on many West Virginians struggling with mental health issues and has made it even harder for many people with substance use disorder to receive treatment,"" said Senator Manchin. “This funding is vital to the fight against the drug epidemic and will help save lives by supporting substance use disorder treatment programs and helping those with mental health issues. This battle is far from over and I will continue to fight for funding to help combat the drug epidemic in West Virginia and provide support for our fellow West Virginians during this difficult time."" 
SENATE PASSES MANCHIN AMENDMENT TO PROTECT RURAL HOSPITALS  The Amendment Was Based On Senator Manchin’s Save Our Rural Health Providers Act That Would Create A 20 Percent Rural Set-Aside In The Provider Relief Fund Washington, DC – This evening, by a 99-1 vote, the Senate passed an amendment to the budget introduced by U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) to help prevent hospitals from closing their doors and protect patients’ access to care, particularly in rural and underserved regions. The amendment strengthens and supports the Provider Relief Fund, which has been a lifeline during the pandemic for hospitals, nursing homes, health centers and physician practices across the country, but especially in rural America. The amendment was co-sponsored by Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Rob Portman (R-OH), Angus King (I-ME), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK).  ""Last year, 18 rural hospitals closed across America and 3 of those closures were in West Virginia, which drastically impacted healthcare access across the state. The CARES Act passed last March established the Provider Relief Fund to support hospitals, health centers, clinics and providers who provide care to our most vulnerable Americans every day,"" said Senator Manchin. ""So far, Congress has appropriated $178 billion to this fund, yet only 6 percent of the funding has been directed to rural providers. I introduced the Save Our Rural Health Providers Act to create a 20 percent set aside in the Provider Relief Fund for these rural healthcare providers. Nearly 20 percent of Americans live in rural communities, making a 20 percent set aside only fair. We’re not asking for a handout, we’re just asking for our fair share and I am pleased my colleagues on both sides of the aisle supported my commonsense amendment."" 
MANCHIN QUESTIONS DEPUTY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE NOMINEE HICKS DURING NOMINATION HEARING  Washington, DC – Yesterday, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), member of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), questioned Deputy Secretary of Defense nominee Dr. Kathleen Hicks during her nomination hearing on business reform and ensuring accountability within the Department of Defense (DoD).  ""The “spend it or lose it” culture that’s in government across the board, how can we change it? How can we spend more money than all the other challengers we have all around the world and not get efficiency from it…I think there is a lot of waste and redundancy that we can really work on…We must also hold the prime contractors that do business with us accountable for the securities of their networks down into their subcontractors…that’s where all the information is being stolen from that has to be secured and it has not been. I look forward to working with you, especially on the business reforms that need to be made,"" said Senator Manchin in part. 
MANCHIN BILL TO PROTECT MILITARY RETIREES FROM LOSING HEALTHCARE  Washington, DC – Yesterday, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) introduced the bipartisan TRICARE Retiree Protection Act to ensure that America’s military retirees will not lose their healthcare as a result of new policy changes that took effect on January 1st, 2021. Senator Steve Daines (R-MT) cosponsored the legislation.  ""Our servicemembers bravely fought for our nation and as they retire after years of selfless service, it is our duty to ensure they’re taken care of. I introduced the TRICARE Retiree Protection Act to extend the grace period from 180 days to 12 months to enroll in a payment plan for retired servicemembers and their families. This extension helps ensure no retired servicemember is left without healthcare coverage, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a member of both the Senate Armed Services Committee and Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, I will continue to fight to ensure our servicemembers and Veterans have access to quality, affordable healthcare to retire in peace,"" said Senator Manchin.

MANCHIN, MURKOWSKI, HASSAN, SHAHEEN, TESTER, CRAMER, KING CALL ON BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO DISTRIBUTE FUNDING TO HELP RURAL COMMUNITIES DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC  Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Jon Tester (D-MT), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Angus King (I-ME) called on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to prioritize and quickly distribute the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund to rural and underserved communities hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, funded in the recent year-end spending package, is intended to support testing, contact tracing, surveillance, containment and mitigation to monitor and suppress COVID-19.  The Senators said in part, “In recognition of the unique challenges faced by high-risk, rural, and underserved areas, and the fact that current population-based formula funding may not factor in these circumstances, Congress set aside $2.5 billion provided in the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund for “high-risk and underserved populations and rural communities” to be allocated in a targeted manner. While this package did not provide the set-aside for rural providers that we have argued for in our bipartisan COVID-19 relief proposal, it provided an essential lifeline to help them navigate these next few months, and it was coupled with other critical assistance for these providers that we urge you to implement as quickly as possible… With the very concerning trends in rural America, additional resources are needed to ensure that health providers and health departments have the funding necessary to address the COVID-19 pandemic. This Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund set-aside should be distributed to support rural and underserved communities across the United States as quickly as possible."" 
MANCHIN: WEST VIRGINIA TO RECEIVE INCREASE IN WEEKLY MODERNA VACCINE ALLOCATION  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) received notification that West Virginia will be receiving an increase in the weekly Moderna vaccine allocation.  ""This afternoon I was notified West Virginia will see a 1,500 dose increase in our weekly Moderna vaccine allocation. West Virginia continues to lead the nation in effective and safe COVID-19 vaccination distribution and I am pleased that these efforts are being rewarded with an increase in these vital doses. As vaccine production increases, I will continue to work with the Biden Administration to quickly procure more doses so every West Virginian who wants a vaccine can get one,"" said Senator Manchin.  This is the second consecutive increase for West Virginia with the state receiving a 3,700 dose increase this week and an additional 1,500 dose increase next week.  On January 21st, Senator Manchin spoke with General Gus Perna, Chief Operating Officer of Operation Warp Speed on COVID-19 vaccine procurement and distribution about the need for additional vaccines in West Virginia. He received assurances that the Biden Administration is ramping up manufacturing and expects to see an increase in distribution to every state in early February.   On January 24th, Senator Manchin spoke with members of the National Economic Council and stressed that the number one priority must be quickly producing and efficiently distributing the vaccine throughout the country.  On January 26th, Senator Manchin applauded the Biden Administration announcement that they would increase the weekly vaccination supply and increase transparency by giving three week forecast of vaccine supplies.  
MANCHIN, CAPITO ANNOUNCE $630K FOR WEST VIRGINIA HEALTH CENTERS  Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $630,480 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to help health centers provide care for minority West Virginians diagnosed with hypertension, or high blood pressure.  ""Our front line healthcare workers have gone above and beyond the call of duty to take care of our fellow West Virginians throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. As we continue to learn more about COVID-19, studies have found that minority populations are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and that there is a direct association between high blood pressure and more severe cases of COVID-19. In West Virginia over 1 in 3 adults have hypertension, making it essential for our healthcare providers to have the necessary resources to help control high blood pressure and improve COVID-19 outcomes in our state. I am pleased HHS is investing in our health centers to ensure they can provide quality, accessible healthcare to our minority communities and as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will continue to advocate for funding and resources to support health centers across West Virginia,"" said Senator Manchin.

ENERGY COMMITTEE NEWS
MANCHIN TO SERVE AS CHAIRMAN OF SENATE ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE   Senator Manchin Will Set Agenda As The Lead Democrat On The Senate Committee On Energy And Natural Resources  Washington, DC – Yesterday, the United States Senate passed the organizing resolution giving Senate Democrats control of committees and officially appointing Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Senator Manchin served as Ranking Member of the committee in the 116th Congress and has been a member of the committee since being elected to the Senate in 2010.  ""I am incredibly proud of everything we accomplished for the people of West Virginia and the entire country during my tenure as Ranking Member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in the 116th Congress. Working in a bipartisan way, we secured the enactment of laws to update our national energy policy for the first time in 13 years through the passage of the Energy Act of 2020. We also permanently reauthorized and provided full, mandatory funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and made monumental investments in our National Park system and other public lands by passing the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act and the Great American Outdoors Act –the most sweeping conservation legislation in a generation. We also passed historic legislation for West Virginia by designating the New River Gorge as a National Park and Preserve, which will promote the beauty and historical significance of the New River Gorge,” Senator Manchin said. “I am proud of the Committee’s productive, bipartisan work last Congress, but our work is never done and with a new administration incoming there is no shortage of work to do to advance a cleaner energy future while ensuring no worker is left behind and our energy independence remains uncompromised As we begin this new Congress, I would like to welcome our new Committee members, Senator John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, who will bring valuable perspective and experience to the Committee. I look forward to working with Ranking Member John Barrasso (R-WY) and every committee member to build upon the accomplishments of the 116th Congress, quickly consider and confirm the nominees that come before our committee, and get to work on the energy and natural resources issues facing West Virginians and Americans everywhere.""  ENERGY COMMITTEE SENDS SECRETARY OF ENERGY NOMINEE TO SENATE FLOOR WITH BIPARTISAN VOTE   Manchin votes to confirm Granholm to be Secretary of Energy  Washington, DC – Today, the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a business meeting to consider the pending nomination of Governor Jennifer Granholm to be the Secretary of Energy. She passed out of committee by a recorded vote of 13-4. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), incoming Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, voted to support Governor Granholm’s nomination. Governor Granholm previously committed to Senator Manchin that DOE will prioritize investments in states that have lost traditional energy jobs.  ""As I said at Governor Granholm’s hearing last week, I believe she is extremely well qualified to lead the Department of Energy and I strongly support her nomination. She has the leadership skills, the vision, and the compassion for people that we need at the helm of the Department of Energy to face the climate challenge, and at the same time, preserve our energy security, protect our national security, cleanup the Cold War legacy, and preserve our scientific and technological prowess. I am pleased to support her nomination, and I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting to report her nomination,” Senator Manchin said.  MANCHIN, COMMITTEE HOLD FIRST CLIMATE HEARING OF 117TH CONGRESS   Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), incoming Chairman of the Committee, convened the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee for a hearing to examine global climate trends from energy related sectors to consider where and how progress has been made in addressing climate change. Senator Manchin stressed the need to put the priorities of our nation before partisan politics and to work together to combat the global climate challenge.  ""Climate change is an issue critical not only to our states, and our nation, but to every country around the world. To address climate change, we must face it, head on, on a global scale and in every sector of our economy. No doubt we will all have differing views on the best way to do that. But first, I believe we must begin with a common understanding of where we stand today, and what got us here. [I]t is abundantly clear that dwelling on partisan rhetoric shuts down debate, collaboration, and progress. As we look for ways to heal the divisions in our own country, I believe that one way for us to overcome our differences of opinion is by first grounding ourselves in the facts, which will serve as a guide going forward,” Senator Manchin said.  Senator Manchin highlighted the declining costs of many energy technologies as a set of facts that make the case for innovation. Senator Manchin also set the economic scene by pointing to downturn in coal communities and other traditional energy producing regions as well as continuing fossil fuel use in other countries as fundamental to the work of the Committee.  ""As our energy mix has changed, concern about the impacts on these traditional energy communities has and will remain front of mind for many of our members and I will continue to work hard to ensure that those communities are given new opportunities to thrive, including as a member of the new IEA global commission focused on examining the impacts of a clean energy transition on individuals and communities. Although fossil fuel consumption is dropping on the U.S. power grid, the global trends in fossil fuel use should make us all recognize that fossil fuels aren’t going anywhere anytime soon, particularly in countries that are seeking to expand access to electricity and energy in order to address poverty.” Senator Manchin said. “By pursuing an all-of-the-above energy policy and a broad array of emissions reducing technologies, we can simultaneously build our technology export opportunities and diplomatic relationships with those countries who choose to utilize their own fossil resources.""  MANCHIN JOINS GLOBAL COMMISSION TO PUT PEOPLE AT THE HEART OF THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION   Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, issued the following statement after accepting an invitation to join Our Inclusive Energy Future: The Global Commission on People-Centered Clean Energy— a newly formed high-level global commission convened by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and made up of key figures from across the globe to examine the social and economic impacts of the shift to cleaner energy technologies on individuals and communities.  ""I am proud to be part of a global effort that acknowledges and will examine the increased hardships on traditional energy producing communities amid the shift to a cleaner energy technologies. As our global energy mix changes, concern about the impacts on these communities that have historically mined the coal, produced the fuels, and generated baseload power has and will loom large for families not only in my state of West Virginia, but across the nation and in every country around the world. I believe it is the responsibility of those who serve in government to also keep it front of mind and ensure that reinvestment is targeted to address that concern. As a member of this new IEA global commission, I will continue to work hard to ensure that these hardworking communities are given new opportunities to thrive. I am honored to join this effort and to ensure we leave no worker behind as we move towards a cleaner energy future.”

4/29/21 19:20,What America Heard Last Night,"Dear Friend,   What the American people heard last night was a President offering compassion, resolve, and a commitment to steadfast leadership. In a very short time, that leadership has already given families across the country cause for celebration: checks in Americans’ pockets, vaccine shots in Americans’ arms, and ‘open’ signs restored to business windows across America. There is light at the end of the tunnel, and that light is brighter every day.   But, as President Biden has made clear, we’re not content with just minimizing the damage the pandemic inflicted, we’re looking to put in place a new vision that creates opportunity, prosperity, and justice for everyone. Every American -- regardless of the color of their skin, their zip code, or current employment status -- needs access to a good-paying, reliable job; a home they can afford; child care they trust; safe drinking water; clean air; and high-quality health care. And we have to stop wasting money paying for the increasingly harsh impacts of the climate crisis instead of creating jobs solving it. I will continue to work alongside my colleagues and the Biden administration to advance the American Jobs Plan and the American Families Plan.    The American Jobs Plan is, as President Biden put it, a robust ‘blue collar blueprint to rebuild America.’ It’s absolutely critical that we rebuild America’s infrastructure, from highways to broadband, and rebuild America’s energy system to support the path to 100% renewable energy. And the American Families Plan is equally important, strengthening the foundation for American families to thrive by improving education and child care and health care. As part of that health care improvement, we must end the price gouging on drugs, by enabling Medicare to negotiate the price of drugs -- or better yet, passing my End Price Gouging for Prescription Drugs Act that will lower your prescription drug prices whether you’re part of Medicare or not.   I believed that President Biden would observe in his speech that building back better includes criminal justice reform and ending discrimination against LGBTQ Americans, and the president did not disappoint. I appreciate that he called out the importance of my Equality Act to fully end discrimination against LGBTQ Americans on the firm foundation of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Last night, transgender children -- who often face tremendous bullying and adversity -- heard a president say to them directly that they now have a president who ‘has their back.’   I’m thankful to have had the chance to talk about what President Biden’s support for the Equality Act means to members of the LGBTQ community in Oregon with my virtual guests Nancy Haque, Executive Director of Basic Rights Oregon (BRO), and Kieran Chase, BRO Transgender Justice Program Manager. Nancy and Kieran have each made significant contributions to the LGBTQ movement in our state, by focusing on building inclusive, strong communities and supporting young people, immigrants, refugees, Black, Brown, and transgender Oregonians in both rural and urban parts of the state.  

 Click here to listen as Nancy, Kieran, and I share our thoughts following last night’s speech.   Of course, all of the hopes and promises depend on a government that works for the people, rather than the powerful. The president noted that we have to defend the right to vote and pass the For the People Act I’m leading in the Senate. This voting rights act stops billionaires from buying elections; ensures that voters choose their politicians rather than the other way around; and protects the freedom and right of every American to cast a ballot -- a right that is under enormous attack in dozens of states across the country.   As the president noted, achieving these important goals -- from the American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan, to the Equality Act and the For the People Act -- requires Congress to act. I hope every senator will work together to realize this powerful vision for America.   All my best,  Jeff

HAPPENING IN THE HOUSE
Speaker Pelosi once again punted to the last minute by playing political games and refusing to negotiate with the Trump Administration for months, forcing us into an impossible situation just before Christmas. We were forced to pass two different continuing resolutions to keep the government open before a larger spending bill was unveiled.
 
Members of Congress only had a matter of hours to read 5,593 pages and vote on a combined $2.3 trillion spending package—one of the largest in history.

Click the above video to hear why I voted ""no"" on the spending bill.
 The bill includes: 
	•	Economic Impact Payments to mixed-status households, providing direct payments to illegal aliens. Retroactively expands this to CARES Act direct payments as well. 
	•	$13 billion to increase SNAP benefits by 15 percent without necessary safeguards. 
	•	Democrats successfully fought to convert the CARES Act $10 billion loan into direct funding for USPS without requiring repayment.
	•	A $300 weekly federal supplemental unemployment benefit will encourage Americans to stay home and cities to remain shuttered.
	•	Negotiated by Speaker Pelosi with little to no input from duly elected representatives and senators.
Click here for full text of the 5,593 page bill. 

NEXT STOP, PRESIDENT TRUMP’S DESK
This week, my legislation increasing resources for Urban Indian Health Organizations (UIHOs) heads to President Trump’s desk after passing both the House and Senate. H.R. 6535 will expand Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) coverage to UIHOs, redirecting hundreds of thousands of dollars in liability costs to patient care.
 
UIHOs play a critical role in providing health care to Native Americans, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. My bill ensures they are covered by the FTCA so they won’t have to use their limited resources to cover costly liability insurance.
 
MYTHBUSTING THE COVID-19 VACCINE

 COVID-19 vaccines are being distributed to Oklahoma and across the country. President Trump’s work and commitment to Operation Warp Speed, have ensured that we are now closer than ever to defeating this invisible enemy. There have been many things said about the vaccine regarding its safety, the process of developing it, and whether people will be forced to get it. I want to set the record straight on some of the most common concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine.
 
INELIGIBLE FOR AN ECONOMIC IMPACT PAYMENT?
If you were ineligible for an Economic Impact Payment based on your 2018 or 2019 tax status or otherwise were ineligible to receive one, you may be able to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit when you file your 2020 taxes. Click here to learn more.
 
You do not need to complete any information about the Recovery Rebate Credit on your 2020 Form 1040 or 1040-SR if your Economic Impact Payment in 2020 was $1,200 ($2,400 if married filing jointly for 2020) plus $500 for each qualifying child you had in 2020. You received all your recovery rebate in 2020.
 
MERRY CHRISTMAS! 


Matthew 1:21 tells us: “And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins.” The true meaning of Christmas is the celebration of the Lord Jesus Christ who was born to this earth to save sinners like us. While this Christmas may look different than past years, I hope you still find time to celebrate the true reason for the season with your loved ones.
 
From my family to yours, I want to wish you a Merry Christmas.

COVID-19 vaccine is here  

The Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation received an initial 4,875 of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine early Thursday morning. This first shipment is comparable to what Vermont, Wyoming, and other smaller population states are receiving. CHCC plans to give priority to healthcare workers, first responders, and high-risk patients, but the goal is to have everyone in the Marianas inoculated as vaccine deliveries continue over the coming months. To ensure that happens, CHCC officials have asked me to take the new vaccine to show the public it is safe. I agreed—as long as everyone in the priority groups is taken care of—and will get my first shot next week. If we want to keep our community healthy and get our economy moving again, all of us will need to get vaccinated. 
 

Not yet on COVID relief

Talks continue, as we go to press, on an omnibus appropriation for the remainder of fiscal year 2021 and for additional economic relief as our nation struggles with the COVID pandemic. The bipartisan group of eight Senators, who have taken the lead on COVID relief, released two draft bills this week. The first contains an extension of unemployment benefits and the Paycheck Protection Program, additional food aid including extra money for the Marianas, and funding for schools, housing assistance, airports, and broadband expansion. The second draft bill is a holding place for two, more controversial proposals: funding to help states pay for policing and other basic services and liability protections for businesses. Republicans generally oppose helping states. Democrats are skeptical of shielding businesses that do not protect workers and customers from the coronavirus. Your congressional office is in direct communication with leadership, who are negotiating a final package, and with the bipartisan Senate “Gang of 8,” advocating for inclusion of the Marianas in all forms of relief. 
 

NMC wins $10.7m EDA grant

Congratulations to Northern Marianas College on the award of $10,681,796 from the 2019 Disaster Supplemental Appropriation, US Public Law 116-20. The money will be used for a Workforce Development and Training Center at the College with fully-equipped classroom, laboratory, and office spaces. The typhoon-resilient Center will be powered by solar panels and be used for teaching and research in food science, plant biotechnology, entomology, and anthropometry. EDA says the project will spur private investment and increase employment opportunities. This grant has been a long time coming. NMC applied on July 3, 2019, just one month after Congress made the disaster recovery funds available for Super Typhoon Yutu recovery. But it has taken the Trump administration 18 months to issue approval – two years after Yutu struck. EDA still has six more disaster recovery grant applications from the Marianas it has not acted on, worth about $85 million. 
 

Larger grants for vets cemeteries

The Marpi cemetery and veterans cemeteries across America stand to receive more federal maintenance funds now that my Veterans Cemetery Grants Improvement Act has been sent to the President for signature. My bill, H.R. 5487, was wrapped into a larger package of veterans measures, H.R. 7105, which the House passed on Wednesday. It doubles the current grant limit of $5 million for cemetery maintenance and should help the Commonwealth keep our Marianas veterans’ final resting place clean and beautiful. 
 
 

18,608 PUA/FPUC claims pending

18,608 Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation applications remain unprocessed by the Commonwealth as of December 12, according to the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL). This is a down from the 27,446 pending applications the Commonwealth’s Department of Labor self-reported to the federal agency in November. USDOL tells the congressional office up to 18,000 of the unprocessed applications are under investigation for potential fraud, because they were filed from outside the Marianas. USDOL expects the Commonwealth to conclude review of the suspected fraudulent claims by the end of December. The PUA and FPUC programs cover unemployment that occurs in 2020, but Congress has provided enough funding so claims for that period can still be processed and paid in 2021.
 

USCIS extends response times

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced today it is extending the response time flexibilities for certain Requests for Evidence and Notices of Intent. The agency originally announced the extra time on March 30, 2020 in consideration of the disruption caused by the coronavirus pandemic. USCIS will continue to consider a response to the following requests and notices received within 60 calendar days after the response due date set in the request or notice before the agency takes any action: 
	•	Requests for Evidence;
	•	Continuations to Request Evidence (N-14);
	•	Notices of Intent to Deny;
	•	Notices of Intent to Revoke;
	•	Notices of Intent to Rescind;
	•	Notices of Intent to Terminate regional centers;
	•	Motions to Reopen an N-400 Pursuant to 8 CFR 335.5, Receipt of Derogatory Information After Grant;
	•	Filing date requirements for Form N-336, Request for a Hearing on a Decision in Naturalization Proceedings (Under Section 336 of the INA); or
	•	Filing date requirements for Form I-290B, Notice of Appeal or Motion.
This flexibility applies to the above documents if the issuance date listed on the request, notice, or decision is between March 1, 2020, and Jan. 31, 2021, inclusive.
 
 

Congratulating young artists. As co-chair of this year's Congressional Art Competition, I recorded a video of congratulations and recognition to all the students who took part in this year's art competition. I encourage you to take a look at this year’s gallery, which features remarkable artwork from 332 congressional districts across the nation, including the Marianas. 
 
 

A room with a view. The Marianas congressional office moved to 2267 Rayburn House Office Building on Wednesday, providing a view of the U.S. Capitol for visiting constituents and a glimpse of the grandstand where President-elect Biden will be sworn in on January 20. Our phone numbers are unchanged. Offices are assigned based on seniority, the length of time an individual member has served in Congress. We look forward to resuming constituent visits, when the pandemic is behind us. 
 
 

Meeting Rota residents. Over the weekend, I travelled to Rota to visit and listen to constituents. Mr. Don Smith met me at the Rota office to address concerns. Thank you to all who I met with on the trip. 
 
 

Welcome, Mr. Berline. This week, attorney Bruce Berline stopped by the Saipan office to catch up. We chatted about his son graduating from high school and about a mutual friend who applied for admission to one of the military service academies. Thanks for the visit, Mr. Berline.

2/14/21 21:59,Weekly Wrap Up,"Dear Neighbor,  I hope this email finds you safe and warm.  Of course, the arctic blast reaching our district tonight is on everyone’s minds.  We are just beginning a challenging few days for our region. Many roads are already closed and unfortunately, there are already accidents from ice on the roads.  So, please stay safe and follow guidance from our local officials.  I’ve been following the weather as well as the events in Washington, and I am glad to send you a summary of news from this week.  It was a busy week, and there is much to report.  Of course, yesterday, the Senate voted to acquit former President Trump against the Article of Impeachment for inciting violence against our democracy.  The second impeachment trial against former President Trump has been one of the most important and somber responsibilities of this Congress.  It is a responsibility I take seriously, and I did when I co-sponsored and voted in favor of the Article of Impeachment.   Throughout the trial this past week, House impeachment managers presented a clear and compelling case to the Senate, laying out the overwhelming and undisputed evidence that that former President Trump incited an insurrection against the government of the United States resulting in an unprecedented attack on the symbolic and functional heart of our democracy, our Capitol.  And, once he had, President Trump failed to defend the Capitol or the government as the attack took place.  There is no greater violation of the Presidential oath to “preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.”  As you know, I was present in the Capitol that day, in the House Gallery, and I saw firsthand the real threat to our country.  I followed the evidence of this week’s trial to see the presentation of the events as they unfolded, including my own evacuation from the Gallery.  The House impeachment managers showed the very physical danger we faced on January 6 as well as the ongoing danger that our country faces and the danger of not holding the former President—or any future President—accountable for actions against our country.  As I told you almost immediately after the events of January 6, I supported addressing the insurrection with the seriousness and immediacy it deserved, including co-sponsoring the Article of Impeachment we passed in the House on January 13.  Many of you agreed, and many of you called or emailed my office asking me to support impeachment.  I also know that some of you did not support impeachment, for multiple reasons.  I appreciate hearing from all of you.  I hope those who agreed and disagreed had the opportunity to see the House impeachment managers present the case this week.  Even Senator McConnell admitted after the trial that “[t]here’s no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day.”  I was disappointed in the final vote in the Senate, but note that in both the House and the Senate, this was the most bipartisan impeachment in the United States history – with 10 Republicans Representatives and 7 Republicans Senators voting to impeach and convict.  I was proud of the work the House managers did to present the case and the constitutional issues as I see them.   At the same time that the impeachment trial took place in the Senate, the House of Representatives worked to respond to the crisis presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.  And that was my primary focus this week. 

The House of Representatives is working to enact President Biden’s American Rescue Plan as quickly as possible.  The Energy and Commerce Committee “marked up” the legislation to end the health and economic challenges caused by the coronavirus for two full days—more than 20 hours debating the provisions in our jurisdiction.  We voted to pass several items to provide relief for families and communities across the country, which will be included in a budget from the House very soon, including: 
	•	investing in a national vaccination program; 
	•	implementing a national testing strategy; 
	•	addressing health disparities for vulnerable populations; and
	•	increasing internet access as families continue remote working and learning.
I am glad that my bill to incentivize Medicaid expansion for Texas and other states that have not yet done so was included as a part of the COVID-19 relief package.  No one should have to worry about affording the health care they need—especially as we face this pandemic.  You can watch my statement during the markup on the vital need for our state to expand Medicaid here. 

In addition to my work on the Energy and Commerce Committee, I was appointed to the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology this week, where I will build on the work I did there in the 116th Congress.


In addition to committee work, I was glad to co-sponsor several critical bills this week, including: 

	•	The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, to prohibit employment practices that discriminate against making reasonable accommodations for qualified employees affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions; 
	•	The Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2021, to end racial and ethnic disparities in maternal health outcomes and achieve maternal health justice; 
	•	The Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal (FAIR) Act, to restore the rights of workers and consumers by prohibiting corporations from forcing individuals into forced arbitration;  
	•	The Research Investment to Spark the Economy (RISE) Act, to provide $25 billion to award to various universities and research institutions to continue their work on ongoing federally funded projects; 
	•	A resolution to award the Congressional Gold Medal to U.S. Capitol Police. 
	•	A resolution expressing support for the Iranian people's desire for a democratic, secular, and nonnuclear Republic of Iran and condemning violations of human rights and state-sponsored terrorism by the Iranian Government.

I also joined my colleagues in sending several letters on matters of concern, including: 

	•	A letter to House and Senate leadership opposing the narrowing of eligibility for Economic Impact Payments in budget reconciliation
	•	A letter to HHS Secretary-Elect Becerra urging HHS to take immediate action to restore many covered entities’ access to lawful drug discounts under the 340B program. 
	•	A letter to Facebook regarding concerns about its advertising practices with my colleagues on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
And my team and I met with dozens of people virtually and over the telephone to talk about their concerns and legislative priorities.  You can see all the bills I have cosponsored at Congress.gov and you can view my full voting record on my website.

Mark your calendars for this Thursday, February 18, 2021 at 6:05pm!  I am hosting another COVID-19 Telephone Town Hall.  As Congress and the new administration ramp up vaccine distribution, I want to make sure all your questions are answered.  I will be joined by representatives from the Texas Department of State Health Services and Harris County Public Health.   You can SIGN UP HERE to make sure you are on the call. 


In the last two weeks, there have been nearly 19,000 new cases of COVID-19 in Harris County.  The positivity rate for our region is 15.5%, a slight decrease from last week.  There is still a high concentration of COVID-19 around Cy-Fair, with more than 3,442 active cases as of Friday.  More than 40,000 people across our state Texas have passed away due to coronavirus—about half of them passed in the last three months.   Vaccinations are picking up across our state and our country, with the average number of vaccines administered daily increasing steadily since December.  Experts continue warn that most Americans won’t be vaccinated until the end of the summer.  With more contagious variants spreading across the country, it is as vital as ever that we continue taking precautions necessary to slow the spread of the virus: wear a mask and limit social gatherings.   As a reminder, because of the winter storm in our region, Harris County COVID19 testing sites and vaccination sites will be closed until Tuesday, February 16.  

This week, I had the privilege and pleasure of meeting virtually with outstanding students from across our district who I had the honor to nominate for an appointment to U.S. military service academies.  I am inspired by their patriotism and desire to serve.  It represents the best of our community and country.  


We were so happy to organize our second annual Valentines for Vets this year, THANK YOU to everyone who participated!  We had an incredible response from our TX-07 community, and our team delivered all the cards to veterans at the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center, thanking them for their service!



And I wish you all a happy Valentine’s Day today and a Happy Lunar New Year to all who celebrate!


As always, my team and I are here to serve you, and I hope you will let us know how we can, especially during these challenging times.  We are just a phone call or an email away—you can reach us at (713) 353-8680 or through email here.  I look forward to hearing from you!
With best wishes,

2/28/21 20:45,"Black History Month, the American Rescue Plan, and a Survey","Dear Friends,  As Black History Month comes to a close today, I wanted to share the roundtable discussion I held last week on the impact of COVID on the Black community. Throughout February, my team and I have had many insightful and productive conversations, and I appreciate these community leaders gathering to share their insight and to discuss actions that communities are taking to address issues like access to vaccines, educational achievement gaps, increased incidence of mental health conditions, and economic well-being.  In this newsletter, you’ll also find an update from Washington and information on the new Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan period.  As the 117th Congress gets underway, I would love to hear from you about the issues you care about most. Please share your thoughts by filling out a quick survey. Hearing from you makes me a better advocate in Congress, and I appreciate your feedback.
Take care and stay safe, 

Mikie Sherrill
   
Black History Month Spotlight: 
COVID-19 Impact and Relief Roundtable

Click to Watch
I hosted a virtual roundtable discussion with Black community leaders focused on the disparate impact of COVID-19 on our communities of color, and how we can most effectively address the barriers that exist in terms of access to healthcare, support, and opportunities for COVID relief.

I was joined by: 
Reverend Dr. Bernadette Glover, St. Paul Baptist Church, Montclair Reverend Dr. Jerry Carter, Calvary Baptist Church, Morristown Reverend Dr. Sidney Williams, Bethel Church of Morristown Dr. Marcheta Evans, President, Bloomfield College Dr. Bette Simmons, Vice President of Student Development and Enrollment Management, County College of Morris Dr. Charlene Gungil, Director, Passaic County Department of Health Dr. Christina Johnson, Atlantic Medical Group, Family Medicine Genaya Palmer, MHA of Essex & Morris Ayo Sanderson Wilson, Founder, Empower the Village Al Pelham, President, Montclair NAACP Rev. Herman Scott, Chaplain, Morris County Correctional Facility
Communities of color continue to be disproportionately impacted by the pandemic in every way imaginable. And these effects will, unfortunately, outlast the pandemic unless we work together to address systemic issues that have long existed and have now been amplified by COVID.
The American Rescue Plan
As I visit communities in North Jersey, the need for additional COVID relief is stark. The House passed the American Rescue Plan this week to provide urgent funding to support vaccine distribution, get children back into schools, and support state and local governments. It will help ensure Americans can pay their bills, stay in their homes, and feed their children. 
Ten million fewer Americans are employed right now compared to before the pandemic – a larger level of job loss than at any point during the Great Recession. We need to provide genuine relief right now because Americans can’t afford years of economic downturn and hardship as a result of the pandemic. Read more about what is in the American Rescue Plan here on my website.
A Moment of Silence For Loved Ones Lost

On Tuesday, I joined my colleagues on the Capitol steps for a moment of silence to remember the 500,000 Americans who have died as a result of coronavirus. Every person we’ve lost is greater than that statistic. They will live on in the memories of those that loved them. I am fighting hard to ensure we get a COVID package signed into law that expands access to testing, vaccines, and PPE while providing support to families, small businesses, and state and local governments that are struggling because of this pandemic. Americans need relief now.

 H.R. 5: The Equality Act

Click to Watch
On Thursday, I voted to pass H.R. 5, the Equality Act, to extend the anti-discrimination protections under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to LGBTQ Americans in housing, education, employment, credit, public accommodation, federal funding, and federal jury service. 
No American should be fired from their job, denied an education, or evicted from their home because of who they are. The Equality Act will ensure equal protection for LGBTQ Americans across the country, following the example we’ve set here in New Jersey. I urge the Senate to send the Equality Act to the president’s desk to deliver this landmark legislation to our LGBTQ community.
SBA PPP Loan Update

5/14/21 18:48,Senator Rick Scott's Week in Review,"This week, Senator Rick Scott led his colleagues in a press conference highlighting the ongoing national security and humanitarian crisis at the U.S. southern border, created by President Joe Biden’s failed policies of open borders and amnesty. For months, Senator Scott has urged President Biden to take responsibility for the crisis created by his reckless policies, and take immediate action to secure the border and protect American families.

Sen. Rick Scott to Biden: Inflation is Happening – Stop Reckless Government Spending 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement amid continued concerning reports of increased inflation. As the prices of every day goods go up, the Biden Administration continues to push radical spending plans that would increase the average taxes owed by families making less than $500,000 by $1,600 per year for ten years - a total of $16,000 in new taxes owed over the next decade. 
Senator Rick Scott said, “I’ve been warning about the risks of out-of-control spending for years. When Joe Biden took office, I immediately urged caution on more government spending that would drive up inflation. Biden and the Democrats didn’t want to listen and now we’re seeing the consequences. Gas prices are going up. Food prices are going up. Costs are rising at every step in the production of goods – costs that get passed on to consumers. These increases directly impact Americans and the decisions they make for their families every single day. When I was growing up, my family struggled to make ends meet and put food on the table as prices went up. This isn’t something the Biden Administration can ignore and this isn’t the time to raise taxes on American families to pay for reckless and unnecessary government spending. 
""We are at a pivotal moment for our nation. The latest Consumer Price Index and Producer Price Index numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics come out this week, and they will likely show more of the same: prices are drastically rising for families in Florida and across the nation. It’s time for President Biden to admit that inflation is happening and its affecting the quality of life for American families. We need to stop the reckless spending, pay down the debt and get our nation on track so every family can succeed.” Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott: States and Locals Should be Responsible and Reject Unnecessary Taxpayer-Funded Bailout 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following the announcement that the Department of the Treasury launched the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds, established by the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, to provide $350 billion in emergency funding for eligible state, local, territorial, and Tribal governments. This news comes as California Governor Gavin Newsom just announced that his state will have a $75.7 billion budget surplus. 
Senator Rick Scott said, “The Democrats just can’t stop throwing money at everyone and everything they see. American taxpayer money. They keep mindlessly spending even as it’s evident our states are doing just fine. California’s operating budget surplus has swelled to an unprecedented more than $75 billion – in the midst of a global pandemic. We knew then that state and local governments didn’t need more federal money, but Democrats in Washington insisted on moving forward with their radical and wasteful plan to give $350 billion in taxpayer money to these states that have been irresponsibly spending for decades. Now that they are seeing fiscal good fortune on the back of the taxpayers, do you think they are going to be responsible? Do you think they’ll stop raising taxes? Of course not. This bailout was nothing more than a liberal payback to governors who helped elect them. 
""We can’t let politicians use American tax dollars to backfill their friends’ mismanaged pensions and state budgets. We’re nearly $30 trillion in debt and inflation is rising from Democrats’ wasteful spending. We need to get serious about how we’re spending taxpayer money. This madness has to stop, and I continue to urge local and state governments to be responsible and reject and return any money in excess of COVID-related expenses.” Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott: Biden Needs to Stand Up for Israel 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement as cross-border fighting between Israel and terrorist militant groups, including Hamas, in Gaza continued to intensify.
Senator Rick Scott said, “While President Trump took unprecedented action to stand with Israel, under President Biden, rockets are raining down on our great ally. It’s time for Biden to stand up and make it clear that the U.S. stands with Israel as it defends its people from these reprehensible terrorist attacks. These Palestinian terrorists need to know acts of aggression toward Israel will never be tolerated. President Biden should take immediate action to remind these terrorists and the world of the United States’ strong and unwavering support of the Israeli people."" Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott: Biden Remains Silent as Inflation Keeps Growing, Hurting Families 
Following the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Senator Rick Scott released the below statement again calling on President Biden to finally admit that inflation is rising and put forward a plan to protect families in Florida and across the nation from growing prices. Today’s BLS data builds on last month’s concerning report, showing that year over year, consumer prices increased 4.2% in April – a significant increase from the 2.6% increase reported for the 12-month period ending in March 2021 and the largest 12-month increase since 2008. Annualized, the monthly CPI growth rate reached 10.3% in April. CPI Food prices have seen a 2.4% increase over the last 12-months while gasoline prices are up 49.6%. 
Senator Rick Scott said, “President Biden’s silence on inflation is deafening and his lack of leadership in the face of this serious threat is hurting people every day. Every increase in food, gas and household good prices, even increases of just a few cents, negatively impact families, especially low income families and those on fixed incomes. For our nation’s poorest families, like mine growing up, rising prices are devastating – I know because I watched my parents struggle with inflation and putting food on the table when I was a kid. 
""Today’s CPI data further confirms our fears and what I’ve been warning about for months. We’ve now seen consistent, month after month rises in prices. Reports show nearly 90% of Americans are worried about inflation. Yesterday, the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) reported that 36% of small businesses are raising prices. There is no question whether inflation is happening. It’s time for Biden to step and address inflation. He can’t keep hiding while American families suffer.” Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott Applauds Committee Passage of His Legislation to Hold Communist China Accountable 
Senator Rick Scott applauded the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee’s passage of his bipartisan American Security Drone Act, which will prohibit the U.S. Government from purchasing drones manufactured in countries identified as national security threats, like Iran and Communist China. 
The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee also passed his and Senator Josh Hawley’s No TikTok on Government Devices Act, legislation to ban all federal employees from using TikTok on government devices. Several government agencies, including the State Department, Department of Homeland Security, and Department of Defense have already banned the use of TikTok on government devices due to cybersecurity concerns and possible spying by the Communist Chinese government. Additionally, the Committee passed Senator Scott and Senator Rob Portman’s Safeguarding American Innovation Act to improve the United States’ ability to combat foreign threats to American universities and research. 
Senator Rick Scott said, “Communist China is America’s enemy and it has shown again and again that it will stop at nothing to infiltrate our government networks and steal American technology. There’s no reason the U.S. should allow Chinese-backed companies into the most sensitive areas of our government, permitting them to jeopardize our national security and steal our intellectual property. Today, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee took a critical step to protect American networks and security by passing my American Security Drone Act, No TikTok on Government Devices Act, and Safeguarding American Innovation Act. I look forward to their full passage in the U.S. Senate.” Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott Leads Colleagues in Demanding That Biden Take Immediate Action to Secure the Border 
Senator Rick Scott led his colleagues in a press conference on the ongoing national security and humanitarian crisis at the U.S. southern border, created by President Joe Biden’s failed policies of open borders and amnesty. Senator Scott was joined by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, City of Yuma Mayor Douglas Nicholls, National Border Patrol Council President Brandon Judd, former Acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan, as well as Senators John Barrasso, Ron Johnson, Mike Lee, Ted Cruz and James Lankford. Watch Senator Scott’s remarks HERE or below. Watch the full press conference HERE. 
Senator Rick Scott said, “There is a manmade crisis on our border and it’s 100% caused by Joe Biden’s reckless open borders and amnesty policies. I saw it firsthand when I traveled to the border with Arizona Governor Doug Ducey in March. Everyone outside of D.C. knows what this is. The mayors, law enforcement and Customs and Border Protection agents on the front lines know it’s a crisis because they’re living it every day. I was honored to be joined by some of these individuals today and hear them share their stories and the challenges they face. 
""While Republicans are unified in our commitment to securing the border, Biden and Harris won’t even visit the border and see the crisis they’ve created. Biden and Harris have made a mockery of a very serious crisis, and instead of taking action, are playing pretend and hiding from the facts. This isn’t a game. Biden is doing nothing to help or protect American families. It’s time to ditch his failed open borders and amnesty strategy and secure the border now.” Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott: April PPI Report Further Confirms Reality of Biden’s Inflation Crisis 
Following the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), Senator Rick Scott released the below statement reiterating his calls for President Biden and the Democrats to finally ditch their reckless and wasteful spending plans which have caused this crisis. Today’s BLS data, in conjunction with yesterday’s Consumer Price Index data, again proves that prices are rising for families in Florida and across the nation – hurting America’s low and fixed-income families the most. According to the BLS, the PPI final demand index moved up 6.2% for the 12 months ending in April, the largest advance since 12-month data were first calculated in November 2010. 
Senator Rick Scott said, “April’s Producer Price Index data confirms what I have been warning about for months – President Biden and the Democrats’ reckless spending and blatant disregard for fiscal responsibility has created an inflation crisis in America. While Biden claims to be focused on lifting up American families, his policies are having the opposite effect and are hurting small businesses and low and fixed-income families the most. 
""Every day that Biden remains ignorant to the impacts of inflation is devastating to families in Florida and across America. Over the year, meat product prices have grown 16% and bread and grain prices have jumped 68%. Price increases like these have an immediate and significant negative effect on so many families. I saw it firsthand growing up in public housing and watching my parents struggle to make ends meet. We need answers now on how Biden will address the inflation crisis he has created and protect families.” Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott Meets with Florida Business Leaders on Need to Get Floridians Back to Work 
Senator Rick Scott met with Florida business leaders who have opened their businesses but are struggling to find enough workers given the enhanced unemployment benefits that are paying Americans more to stay home than go back to their jobs.
This week, Senator Scott joined his colleagues to introduce the Get Americans Back to Work Act to revise the additional unemployment benefit to $150 per week on May 31, 2021, before full repeal on June 30, 2021. This legislation follows the release of the Department of Labor report showing that the U.S. economy created only 266,000 jobs in April, well below the anticipated million-jobs increase, and unemployment rose for the first time since April 2020.
Senator Rick Scott said, “It’s heartbreaking to hear from Florida business leaders that have done everything needed to survive shutdowns and the impacts of COVID-19 and now find themselves struggling to fully reopen. What I heard from them today is what I’ve heard from countless other businesses in Florida and across the nation in recent months – they can’t compete when the federal government is paying Americans more to stay home than go back to their jobs. 
""Since the beginning of the pandemic, I have supported the effort to get targeted aid to struggling families and businesses. I fought to include a provision in the CARES Act to ensure we weren’t creating a disincentive to return to work, but the Democrats blocked it. Now we are seeing the consequences. I applaud Governors across the nation who are taking action to get their citizens back to work. While President Biden and the Democrats remain in denial about what is happening, I will keep working to support our small businesses, get Americans back to work and get our economy fully reopened."" Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott: Biden’s Shameful Silence on Communist China’s Human Rights Abuses 
Following the U.S. State Department and world leaders again condemning the genocide of Uyghur Muslims in Communist China, Senator Rick Scott released the following statement calling on President Biden to stop ignoring Communist China’s horrific human rights abuses and finally join his call to move the 2022 Olympic Games out of Beijing and to a nation that respects human rights. It has been more than two months since Senator Scott requested a meeting with Biden to discuss the Senator’s continued calls for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to select a new site for the 2022 Winter Olympics Games. Last month, Senator Scott also called for President Biden to lead international efforts to relocate the 2022 Olympic Games to the United States. 
Senator Rick Scott said, “It’s been more than two months since I asked President Biden to stand up for human rights and meet with me to discuss moving the Olympics out of Communist China. Biden’s response? Nothing. Total silence. General Secretary Xi is committing a genocide against the Uyghurs, stripping Hong Kongers of their basic rights and is building up China’s military to compete with us and further its goal of world domination. Biden’s own State Department official accused Beijing of turning the Xinjiang province into an ‘open-air prison.’ Under no circumstance should the global community give Communist China an international platform – the 2022 Olympic Games – to whitewash its crimes, yet Biden seems unconcerned.
""Like the crisis at the border and the rising inflation that’s hurting American families, Biden is completely absent when it comes to standing against Communist China’s human rights abuses. I’ve been clear – this isn’t about a boycott, which only punishes athletes. That’s a weak and frankly pathetic response being used by United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC) and others to justify keeping the Games in Communist China. This is about human rights and about saying what General Secretary Xi is doing is wrong and won’t be tolerated. Period. President Biden has the unique opportunity to lead international efforts and encourage organizations like USOPC to stand for human rights and relocate the 2022 Olympic Games to the United States. Instead, Biden refuses to even take a meeting to discuss standing up for freedom. It’s shameful, but I’m not giving up this fight.” Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott Introduces Safe Social Media Act to Study Social Media Use Among Teens 
Senator Rick Scott introduced the Safe Social Media Act which requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), in coordination with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), to conduct a study on the effects of social media use among American teenagers and children.
Last month, Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky requesting information on CDC studies and actions to address the extended use of social media by American children and young adults, and its potential impact on their health and wellbeing. 
Senator Rick Scott said, “The COVID-19 pandemic has taken a toll on all Americans, but our children and teens have had their lives drastically altered. With school closures and more time indoors, kids have been spending even more time on the internet and on social media. Now with the news that Facebook is developing an Instagram app for kids under 13, it is more important than ever that we understand the impacts of extended social media use on children and teens. My Safe Social Media Act  will make sure the federal government studies the risks associated with the repeated and long-term use of social media by those under the age of 18 and reports its findings to Congress along with policy recommendations.” Read more HERE.

DHS Secretary Mayorkas Dodges Sen. Rick Scott’s Questions on Border Security 
During a hearing of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Rick Scott questioned Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on the ongoing national security and humanitarian crisis on our southern border created by President Joe Biden’s failed policies of open borders and amnesty. Secretary Mayorkas refused to provide clear answers on how the administration is enforcing U.S. immigration laws and taking action to protect American families.
Senator Rick Scott said, “Today, I asked for simple answers from DHS Secretary Mayorkas on how DHS and the Biden Administration are enforcing current immigration law and keeping drugs and potentially dangerous, illegal aliens who have been convicted of serious crimes, out of our nation. He dodged my questions and, following the lead of President Biden and Vice President Harris, is hiding from the facts. That’s unacceptable. 
""Yesterday, I was joined by number of Senators and local officials from border states to highlight the absolute crisis on our southern border and how it’s putting American families and our brave CBP officials at risk. It seems obvious to everyone outside of Washington, D.C. that there’s a crisis, especially those on the frontlines of our border communities who see it every day. So why does President Biden and his administration refuse to take responsibility for the crisis they created with reckless open border and amnesty policies? The American people deserve accountability, and to know that our border is secure and their families are being protected. I won’t accept anything less.” See more from the hearing HERE or below.

Sen. Rick Scott to President Biden: Protect American Innovation That Created COVID-19 Vaccine 
Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to President Joe Biden outlining his concerns about the White House’s decision to back a proposed waiver for COVID-19 vaccine intellectual property rights, which would seriously undermine protections for American innovation and investment. Senator Scott also highlighted the need to fairly distribute vaccines around the world, including to the people of the Bahamas.
Last month, Senator Scott wrote to Secretary of State Antony Blinken urging the Biden Administration to consider the many Venezuelans suffering under the oppressive dictatorship of Nicolás Maduro as it contemplates how to distribute the United States’ excess doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. Senator Scott’s letter followed reports that Maduro is restricting vaccine distribution to those who have pledged political loyalty to him and his socialist dictatorship. Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott: Biden’s Inflation Crisis is Here – He Must Address the Impacts of Reckless Liberal Spending 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement urging the Biden Administration to finally take responsibility for the effects of his reckless spending and release a plan to curb the threat of rising inflation on American families. While the Biden Administration continues to mislead the American public about rising prices across the nation, Senator Scott will be releasing a weekly update on his actions to address America’s debt crisis and rising inflation.
Senator Rick Scott said, “I’ve been warning for two years now that reckless spending has consequences. Here’s the reality: our nation is nearing $30 trillion in debt, and while President Biden and Democrats are lost in their whirlwind of multi-trillion dollar proposals, 87% of Americans are concerned about the rising costs of household items, like diapers, gas and groceries. April Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) were up 4.2% and 6.2%, respectively, the largest 12-month advances since 2008. April PPI data showed that over the year, meat product prices have grown 16% and bread and grain prices have jumped 68%. It’s time for Biden and Democrats to open their eyes, stand up for working class families and realize their reckless spending is ruining our economy and devastating America’s low and fixed-income families, like mine growing up.” Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott Urges Social Media CEOs to Protect Children, Support his Safe Social Media Act 
Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to the CEOs of Twitter, Facebook, Alphabet and Snap Inc. requesting their full support of his legislation, the Safe Social Media Act, which requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), in coordination with the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), to conduct a study on the effects of social media use among American teenagers and children. 
The Safe Social Media Act, introduced this week, follows Senator Scott’s March letter to these CEOs requesting information from the companies on the impacts of extended use of their platforms by American children and young adults, and his letter to CDC Director Rochelle Walensky requesting information on CDC studies and actions on these potential impacts.

5/15/21 6:02,Delivering a COVID lifeline for our children,"The American Rescue Plan Lifts Up our Capital Region Families and Communities
 
 
May 15, 2021  
Dear Friend,
Week after week, we are seeing new and uplifting benefits from the American Rescue Plan for our Capital Region communities, delivering vaccines in arms, money in pockets, children in classrooms and workers in jobs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention even confirmed this week that fully-vaccinated Americans can now get back to everyday life. As President Biden put it in his first joint address to Congress: “America is on the move again.”
Make no mistake, the dangers of this global pandemic remain and our work of rebuilding America is just getting started. But I’m pleased to report that, with the American Rescue Plan, help is here. 
In addition to the many benefits for workers, small businesses, restaurants and others, we’re starting to see funding and other support arriving in our region for education, and especially for our struggling students. This week, I announced that 17 of our Capital Region colleges and universities will receive more than $143 million in COVID-19 relief through our American Rescue Plan. At least half of this funding will be distributed in the form of emergency cash assistance grants directly to students who are facing hunger, homelessness and other hardships.
A strong investment in our students is a strong investment in our future. Our COVID-19 lifeline delivers a full federal response to meet the needs of our students and higher education institutions still reeling from the financial fallout of this pandemic. 
Much of the vital support for workers and families we included in the American Rescue Plan is still on the way. This includes advance monthly payments of the Child Tax Credit.
The expanded and improved Child Tax Credit is an historic change that serves as a lifeline to the middle class and cuts child poverty. It provides children and their families with additional payments throughout the year to help with the costs of food, childcare, diapers, healthcare and clothing.
This tax cut for families with children will support 27 million American children.
In our own Capital Region:
	•	82.3% of children in NY-20 stand to gain from the new Child Tax Credit; that’s 121,00 children.
	•	This credit will help lift 5,200 Capital Region children out of poverty.
	•	The average benefit for 37,100 households is $2,600.
	•	Families with children in poverty will receive $4,800 on average.
Advance monthly payments of the Child Tax Credit will help set America’s children up for success and put more money in the pockets of hardworking parents sooner to pay for childcare or put gas in the car so they can go to work and help fuel our economy while building better lives for their families.
These payments could be sent out as soon as July of this year. Qualifying families can get up to $300 a month per child for children ages 0 to 5 and $250 a month per child for children ages 6 to 17. If you are eligible, the best way to ensure you receive accurate payments as soon as possible is to file a 2020 tax return ahead of the May 17th deadline. Families can file taxes for free online through the IRS Free File program.
Last but certainly not least, don’t miss the “DID YOU KNOW?” section below with some details on a valuable new federal resource we’ve set up for households struggling to afford baseline broadband internet service.  
As we continue to break new ground in the fight against this pandemic, I will continue working in Congress to deliver the resources Americans need to carry them through.  
As always, thank you for reading.
 Your friend,  
  DID YOU KNOW?
Throughout this pandemic, my office and I have worked to make sure you remain informed with the latest updates and recommendations on any and all COVID-19 related topics. With that in mind here is some information from the IRS that may be of interest to you:
	•	This week, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced the beginning of open enrollment for the Emergency Broadband Benefit (EBB) Program to help economically vulnerable Americans afford their monthly internet bill.
	◦	The $3.2 billion program was created as part of the final omnibus appropriations bill in December, and will provide households a discount on their monthly internet bill.
	•	The EBB Program will provide struggling families a discount of $50, or $75 on tribal lands, off the monthly cost of home internet service. It may also provide an additional subsidy for a computer.
	•	Internet providers who participate in the program can apply to the FCC for reimbursement.
	•	Households interested in learning whether they qualify are encouraged to visit the FCC’s new enrollment website – https://getemergencybroadband.org/ – and then sign up for the program through their internet service provider.
	•	For more information on the program itself, visit: https://www.fcc.gov/broadbandbenefit.

4/11/21 23:34,Weekly Wrap Up,"Dear Neighbor,
  
As I wrap up an eventful district work period, I am glad to share a few highlights before I head back to Washington.  It has been terrific to visit with people across our community, and I want to thank everyone who shared their stories and views.
  

  
As vaccination efforts across our community continue to increase, I was glad to visit the vaccination site at BakerRipley in Gulfton in partnership with Houston Methodist.  These kind of innovative partnerships reflect the very best of our community—and I was grateful to see it first hand with the leaders of these efforts from both organizations.  
  

  

  
In other great news this week, FEMA announced that it would extend the Community Vaccination Center at NRG Park for an additional month  for an additional month and an additional 120,000 doses at the request of Judge Hidalgo and Mayor Turner.  I was glad to support this effort to extend the Community Vaccination Center at NRG Park, with my colleagues Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee, Al Green, and Sylvia Garcia.  Continued support from FEMA is critical to our region’s recovery efforts, and a key part of our commitment to working at all levels of government to combat the virus by working together. 
 
I encourage who still need to get their vaccination to do so.  As I learned on Friday, you can sign up through Houston Methodist at the following link: https://www.houstonmethodist.org/texas-vaccine-hub/. 
  

  
Thank you to everyone who joined me and State Representative Ann Johnson for our virtual town hall on expanding health care in our state!  Making sure that everyone in our community has access to quality, affordable health care is a priority at both the federal and state levels, and everyone who participated this week provided insightful questions.  I am grateful for Representative Johnson’s work in our state and glad to have her as my representative! 
  

  
Virtual Town Hall with Rep. Ann Johnson
  
I also had the opportunity this week to speak with several student groups, including students at the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University on the challenges and opportunities of creating and implementing thoughtful science and technology policy, students at the University of Houston during a Congressional Forum with my colleague Congressman Randy Weber, and high school and college members of Texas State of the Students to discuss our work in Congress.  
  

  
Speaking with Texas A&M Students
  

  
Speaking at University of Houston’s Congressional Forum 
  
I also visited with lots of constituents over the phone or on Zoom on a wide range of issues, from entrepreneurship to epidemiology to the environment.  I am glad to bring the diverse voices of our district with me to Washington as I work on the important issues facing our community.  
  

  
I enjoyed speaking with our TX-07 Congressional App Challenge winner, Ethan Saadia, for our virtual House of Code event.  His app, Wayt, meets the needs of our community for this moment, allowing customers and businesses to interact safely.  You can listen to our conversation by clicking below! 
  

  

  
Across the district, the pace has picked up.  I could feel it over the last few weeks, as I bet you can, too.  There are more people on the roads, in the shops, and at the restaurants.  As with this incredible weather we’ve had, it feels good to be outdoors!  But, several public health experts reminded us again just this week that it is vital we remain vigilant about the spread of the virus.  They described at to me as a kind race between the vaccine and the variants we know are present in our community.  So, I encourage you to get vaccinated, to keep wearing your mask (even if vaccinated), and to follow CDC guidance on how you can help stop the spread.
 
The current COVID-19 positivity rate in Harris County is at 8.5 percent.  The 14-day average of daily new COVID-19 cases in our county is at 533 and the 14-day average of virus patient occupancy of ICU beds is 15.76 percent.  With these metrics, Harris County remains at its highest COVID-19 threat level, which will only be reduced when the positivity rate is reduced down to five percent, the 14-day average of daily new COVID-19 cases lowers to at least 400, and the 14-day average of virus patient occupancy of ICU beds is at 15 percent or lower.  We can do this if we work together.
  

  
A reminder of some important dates for Texas’ Seventh Congressional District:
	•	Tuesday, April 20: FEMA’s deadline for applications to register for individual disaster assistance following February’s Winter Storm.  If you sustained damage to your residence from the winter storms and you have insurance, contact your insurance company and then FEMA.  For more information on winter storm disaster aid, click here. 
	•	Friday, April 23: Texas’ Seventh Congressional Art Competition submissions are also due.   Each year, talented young artists have produced beautiful art that reflects the diverse experiences and beauty across our district, and I am looking forward to seeing their submissions this year.  You can learn more and submit artwork here.
	•	Monday, April 26: Texas’ Seventh Congressional District Internship Program applications for the Summer are due. University students and recent graduates who are interested in gaining valuable insight about congressional work are welcome to apply Our interns receive the opportunity to work closely with our team.  If you or someone you know is interested in interning in our office this Summer, you can begin the application process here.
I’m headed back to DC next week, and I look forward to providing an update on my legislative work.  Until then, if you need anything at all, please call my office at (713) 353-8680 or (202) 225-2571, or email here.  My team and I are proud to serve you and here to help you!

Below please find the Murphy office update on COVID-19. 
As always, if you need assistance, please don't hesitate to contact our Hartford or Washington, D.C. offices. 
Here’s what you need to know this week: 
	•	This week, Governor Ned Lamont announced that Connecticut had reached a milestone in its vaccination efforts. 55% of people in Connecticut over the age of 16 have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. All adults ages 16+ are now eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine in Connecticut. To learn more and register to get vaccinated visit ct.gov/covidvaccine.
	•	As the new chairman of the U.S. Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, Senator Murphy chaired his first hearing this week on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)’s response to COVID-19 and other challenges, including disaster preparedness. Click here to watch his opening remarks.
	•	This week, Senator Murphy introduced the Choose Medicare Act, legislation to give every individual who is not already eligible for Medicaid or Medicare the opportunity to enroll in Medicare as an individual and give every employer the ability to purchase Medicare for their employees.
	•	As more COVID-19 variants spread across the country, the Biden administration announced that its investing $1.7 billion from the American Rescue Plan to help states and other jurisdictions more effectively fight these mutations. Connecticut is set to receive almost $3 billion. Click here to read the administration’s plan.
	•	Governor Lamont announced that his administration is launching a new state program aimed at engaging with K-12 students who struggled with absenteeism and disengagement during the 2020-21 school year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The initiative, known as the Learner Engagement and Attendance Program (LEAP), will include a partnership between the Connecticut State Department of Education (CSDE) and the six state Regional Education Service Centers (RESCs) that will target 15 school districts throughout Connecticut. These efforts aim to bring students back to their school communities for the final months of the school year as well as supporting enrollment in upcoming summer camps and learning programs, helping students and families feel ready and engaged for the next school year. Funding for this program came from the COVID-19 relief bill Congress passed in December.

1/29/21 15:15,State of the Sixth Address,"Updates from Chrissy!
 
  Dear Lindsey, 
The Commonwealth we call home is where this wonderful democratic experiment, the United States, began. Our very own Benjamin Franklin issued a now historic and oft-repeated warning – we have a republic, if we can keep it.
For me, there is no if. There is only a must.
Our democracy endures because we profoundly believe in the tenets that bind us together not only as a nation, but also as a citizenry.
I just presented our second annual State of the Sixth address to our community. As your elected member in Congress, I am so grateful to share with you the work that we are accomplishing on behalf of the people of the Pennsylvania Sixth and to continue the discussion about our democracy. 

In This E-Newsletter You Will Find:  Recent/Upcoming Events — Including last night's State of the Sixth and next week's dial-in town hall focusing on vaccine distribution here in our community.  What We're Working On —  Including bipartisan legislation I introduced yesterday that will help create jobs and foster the entrepreneurial spirit our country needs at this critical time.  Delivering For Our Community — Including the total number of constituents we helped during my first term in Congress and a recent example of casework where we assisted John in Coatesville resolve his problem with the USPS. 
 .  .  .

Recent/Upcoming Events
State of the Sixth and Virtual Swearing-In Ceremony


A few weeks ago in Washington, I had the privilege of taking the oath of office again on behalf of our community and country. As you can imagine, it was a very different experience with COVID than it was a couple of years ago. We were called in shifts, and I took my oath in the back corner of the House Floor (referred to as 'Pennsylvania Corner') largely on my own. It was a chance to reflect quietly and contemplatively on the words of this sacrosanct oath. We thought that it might be good to breathe those words to life again with you all who were not able to join me in DC.

I am very thankful to Judge Analisa Sondergaard, Court of the Common Pleas of Chester County, who led me in my virtual oath of office, which you can watch here.



Reflecting on my first term in office, one of our early goals was leading with a new level of transparency, accessibility and accountability. To that end, we committed to holding at least one town hall per month, and we have more than met that goal. In fact, we hosted more in-person and virtual town halls than any other member of the Pennsylvania delegation.
In recognition of the efforts of our team, the Congressional Management Foundation awarded our office the Democracy Award for Transparency and Accountability. Only two awards in this category are awarded each year, and they are awarded bi-partisanally and bi-camerally. Our office is the first freshman office to receive this recognition. 


For those of you who attended last night's address, these slides should look familiar! Now, I know many of us can't see the details, but I just wanted to give you a visual of the many topics we covered. I talked about the importance of engaging with constituents in new and creative ways, the inspiration I've drawn from our community as essential workers continue to serve us, our voter participation initiative, and our efforts to promote our agricultural economy.

Regarding our COVID-19 response, I outlined our fight for local small businesses that have been so gravely affected by this pandemic. I serve on the Small Business Committee because I know that the businesses of Main Street are the backbone of our economy. I also detailed our office's actions to support educators and students through additional funding, address the affordable housing and eviction crisis too many families are facing, and host necessary conversations about equity and equality in our nation.

If you have the time, you can see all of these slides (at normal size!) and watch the entirety of my live presentation at this link.
Next Week: Community Town Hall to Discuss Covid Vaccine Distribution
Our office has been getting many questions about vaccine distribution. To address those questions, we are hosting a Vaccine Telephone Town Hall next Wednesday, February 3 at 6:00PM. To participate, please dial (855) 731-4616. Vaccines are one of the most effective tools we have to contain this virus. I encourage all Pennsylvanians to get the vaccine when it is made available to you. In Congress, I’m working to secure aid for states and localities so that they can more quickly distribute vaccines. 

But even with the vaccine, we must continue to practice social distancing and wear masks to most effectively and efficiently contain and beat this virus. Below is some information about the current state of vaccine distribution in our Commonwealth: 

	•	Pennsylvania is currently in group 1A of the vaccination phase. This includes health care workers, residents of long-term care facilities, persons ages 16-64 with high-risk conditions, and folks 65 and older. An exhaustive list of those who fit under 1A can be found on PA’s vaccine site. 
	•	Those that wish to be vaccinated can pre-register for vaccination on the Chester County vaccination site. Anyone who works or resides in Chester County may pre-register even if they don’t meet the current group criteria. Once you pre-register, you will receive notifications as appointments become available for COVID-19 vaccine. This will also keep folks updated on the current group phase. 
	•	Constituents living in Berks County can visit the Berks vaccine site to find vaccine providers within the county. 
	•	Please contact the PA Dept. of Health if you do not have access to a computer or smartphone at 1-877-724-3258 for more information on scheduling a vaccine appointment. Only folks who fit under the 1A group are being vaccinated at this time, therefore they are the only ones who can schedule vaccination appointments.
What We're Working On
Helping Create Jobs and Foster the Entrepreneurial Spirit


As a former engineer and entrepreneur, I know the problems our small businesses and entrepreneurs face in normal times and that those problems have multiplied tenfold during this pandemic. We need to be doing everything in our capacity to support our talented entrepreneurs in translating their innovative ideas into marketable products and cutting-edge technology – too many endeavors fail because they lack access to capital or face IP protection challenges. 

Pennsylvania is home to a number of successful startups, which began with an idea and have turned into small businesses, creating jobs on Main Street and products Americans use every day. I’m proud to work with Representative Balderson on this bipartisan legislation that will help jumpstart job creation and support our entrepreneurs and small business owners. We cannot wait.
Backing President Biden's American Rescue Plan



Just a couple weeks ago, I represented our community at President Biden and Vice President Harris' Inauguration. We are in the early days of this new Administration and new Congress and there is so much work to be done. First and foremost, we must work together to crush this virus.
My top priority is continuing to provide relief to our community during this pandemic. I'm supporting additional funds and aid for vaccine distribution, fighting for our small businesses so they can weather this crisis, rebuilding our economy in a way that creates opportunities for everyone, regardless of skill level, and creating jobs that pay a living wage in Chester and Berks counties. We must work to rebuild a more inclusive economy and that includes a robust infrastructure package.
ICYMI: Our Valentines for Veterans Project



Many of you have already seen our Valentines for Veterans initiative. In fact, we've already received our first card, pictured above! We are inviting students and residents in the region to participate in the Valentines for Veterans project by making (or buying if you unable to craft yourself!) cards for area veterans to thank them for their service. Remember, the cards will be delivered in the days before Valentine's Day to veteran neighbors. Those who wish to participate may drop off or mail cards to our West Chester office during normal business hours between now and Friday, February 12. Call (610) 883-5050 with any questions.
 
Delivering for Our Community: Constituent Services

As I mentioned during last night's address, our office has closed nearly 2,000 constituent cases to date, and we stand ready to continue serving our community. Especially during this pandemic, we understand that many of our neighbors are navigating difficult situations with the IRS, Social Security Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, and others. Let me be very clear; we are here to help. Here's what John from Coatesville had to say about our constituent services:



If you are having an issue with a Federal Agency, fill out our form and our team will contact you! We also invite you to read more success stories here. Remember, our website is always a resource for you and your family.

On Thursday, we joined 126 House Republicans in filing an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court—standing up for our nation’s election integrity. Americans deserve to have full confidence in our election process, and we will continue fighting to protect our democracy.  We were also proud to see that two pieces of legislation introduced by our office passed the House this week: the HBCU PARTNERS Act which strengthens federal partnerships with these proud institutions as well as a bill to rename a Greensboro post office in honor of Congressman Howard Coble. For more than three decades, he blessed our community with his humbling leadership, representing the Greensboro area valiantly throughout the halls of Congress. Although Congressman Coble passed away in November 2015, he left behind a lifelong legacy of friendship, patriotism, and commitment to conservative principles. Now, this legislation is one step closer to creating a permanent reminder of his service and legacy that will live on for generations to come.  Monday also marked the 79th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor. December 7, 1941 truly was ""a date which will live in infamy"" as our nation was formally thrust into World War II. We continue to honor and remember the 2,403 service members and civilians who gave their lives for this great nation.   Additionally, we were proud to announce Jayden Sansom and Sushen Kolakaleti as the winners of the 2020 Congressional App Challenge for North Carolina’s Sixth District. Established by the U.S. House of Representatives in 2013, this competition engages students from across the nation to encourage creativity and STEM education. Both Jayden and Sushen displayed exceptional proficiency, talent, and hard work in their impressive designs.
Keep reading for the full update. Have a blessed week.
Sincerely,

On Thursday, the House passed our legislation to rename a U.S. Postal Service Office in Greensboro as the J. Howard Coble Post Office Building.  For more than three decades, Howard Coble blessed our community with his humbling leadership, representing the Greensboro area valiantly throughout the halls of Congress. It is my utmost honor to see this permanent reminder of his service has passed the House so the legacy of my friend and mentor will continue to live on for generations to come.

1/13/21 21:11,Politicizing Impeachment,"Weekly Newsletter: January 13, 2021



Politicizing Impeachment

Last week’s violent attack on the U.S. Capitol was abhorrent, and I condemn every unlawful action that occurred. Every single person who participated deserves to be prosecuted. The intimidating acts against Capitol Police, other law enforcement, and congressional Members and staff, including bomb threats, have no place in a free and functioning Republic. I grieve for our nation and the Capitol Police and others who lost their lives and are still recovering as a result of the riot.
 
Information regarding last week’s attack is still forthcoming. Investigations are only beginning and there is much we do not yet know. Capitol Police leadership and other law enforcement agencies owe Congress and the American people answers. However, we do know the FBI office in Virginia has made clear that they had communicated potential premeditated threats to D.C. and the Capitol ahead of the January 6th rally. 
 
It is fair to say that the expectations for what could be accomplished in terms of certifying the election on January 6th were inflated beyond what was reasonable — especially concerning the constitutional authorities of the Vice President in counting the electoral college vote. But the President was clear that day in saying ""I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.""
 
One year ago, over my objection, Congress took what was considered a once-in-a-generation vote to impeach a president. That vote followed a hyper-politicized effort that had begun before he was even elected. Sadly, under current Democratic leadership, impeachment has become a politicized tool — part of the cancel culture movement of the left to silence dissent. With only one week until Inauguration Day, it is not in the best interest of the nation to move forward in this way. And with only one week since the tragic events of January 6th, it is not being done with the rigorous examination, debate, and due process such an extraordinary measure mandates. 
 
During this time I have thought a lot about Ronald Reagan’s remarks that ""freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.""
 
As a nation, we are in need of healing and restoration. We need a return to honest dialogue and debate over political issues. Trading 280 character barbs will not lead to better policy for the American people nor the understanding that leads to healthy communities and families. I am firmly committed to standing strong for the conservative constitutional principles that have guided this great American experiment in self-governance — and opposing the doctrines that would seek to undermine free people. How we go about those debates is important and says a lot about who we are as a people. And while we work toward that more perfect union, it will do us well to remember Benjamin Franklin’s admonishment from Scripture to us that ""unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain."" May God bless you and have mercy on our nation.


Calling Out the Hypocrisy of Big Tech




Our country is in a dangerous place when the social media companies that colluded to suppress news about the election are now limiting free speech. The deceptive algorithms and censoring is unacceptable. I question the motives of companies that permit the Chinese Communist Party to freely post but limit Americans. I believe it is hypocritical and inconsistent, which is why Congress needs to focus on this bipartisan issue in the 117th Congress. I spoke with Crossroads about this topic. You can watch the full interview HERE. As a result of Big Tech's censorship, I recently joined Gab and Parler. Follow me @RepCloudTX. 


Reintroducing the Improving Confidence in Veterans' Care Act




You may remember that I first introduced a bill to improve the quality of healthcare that veterans receive from the Veterans Healthcare Administration in June 2019. I just reintroduced it into the 117th Congress and will press for it to be signed into law. The Improving Confidence in Veterans’ Care Act will help foster veterans’ confidence specifically in VA physicians.  

A report found that some Veterans Health Administration facilities had hired unqualified doctors who had lost their medical licenses, some for reasons like patient neglect or other serious offenses. The main reason unlicensed doctors were permitted to practice was because VHA employees were not properly trained on the resources available to check the status of these licenses. I reintroduced my bill to correct this oversight and help improve veterans’ confidence in VA physicians. Unqualified doctors should not be providing care for our veterans, and my bill would make sure that any doctor whose license has been taken away or suspended would not be allowed to practice medicine for the VA.

Our nation owes it to our veterans to deliver on the promises we made to them - because exceptional Americans like our veterans deserve exceptional healthcare.


Our Office Can Cut Red Tape For You




My office stands ready to assist any constituents in the 27th Congressional District of Texas with casework related to agencies such as the Social Security Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, the State Department, and Veterans Affairs. In 2020, we successfully closed over 1,000 cases and returned over $3 million in compensation to those it was due. We can also assist those who are awaiting direct payments stemming from the most recent Covid relief package. If you need assistance with a federal agency or your stimulus check, please call our district offices to get started or visit my website by clicking HERE. 


COVID Vaccine Update

For your situational awareness: If you would like to receive the COVID vaccine, please check the COVID‑19 Vaccination Hub Providers page to find a hub near you and register. At this time only Nueces County is listed in our district and registration is closed. We will update you when it's reopened. 

Alternately, you can also check the websites of vaccine providers listed on the Texas COVID‑19 Vaccine Availability map to track the current vaccine supply. Specific vaccine registration information for Nueces County is linked HERE and Victoria County is linked HERE. At this time, these are the only two counties with vaccines currently available. We will also update you as more doses are shipped across the district. 

Keep in mind:
	•	Instead of showing up at a hospital or clinic looking for the vaccine, please check their website for information on availability. 
	•	Call only if the website does not answer your questions. 
	•	The current vaccine supply in Texas is limited (but more arrives every week) and it will take time to vaccinate all.


In Other News:

	•	My top priority continues to be representing our part of South Texas in Washington. There will be much work ahead as we keep fighting to fix what's broken in Washington and deliver results for people in Texas. I work for you, and I hope you will continue to share with me your thoughts and concerns as we move forward.

Dear Friend:   
Our country is reckoning with a deadly pandemic that only continues to worsen. This week, the United States crossed 15,700,000 infections and 293,000 deaths due to COVID-19. Day after day, we are setting dangerous new records for case numbers and hospitalizations, both nationally and in our home state. It is vital we slow the spread by continuing to maintain social distancing, wearing a face covering, and practicing good hygiene.  
As the virus worsens and tens of millions of Americans continue to collect unemployment, the House of Representatives has acted decisively to send relief to American workers, businesses, states, and cities. We passed the HEROES Act in May, and a version again in October, to provide fresh economic aid to families, state and local governments, and essential workers on the front lines of this pandemic. Mitch McConnell’s Senate has refused to even consider it for now over six months. 

Time and time again, House Democrats have passed legislation to safeguard democracy, help workers and families weather this crisis, and protect our institutions from the Trump administration's vandalism. Each time, the McConnell Senate has blocked progress and prioritized packing the courts with right-wing judges. Our neighbors are in need and I am committed to continuing the fight for urgent relief in Washington. Too much is at stake. 

Bringing Federal Dollars Home 
This week, I was glad to announce that Governor Phil Murphy and his administration have awarded millions in annual 9% federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits to housing developments throughout New Jersey. These federal tax credits will support the development of new apartments for New Jersey families, seniors, and residents with special needs. In the Ninth Congressional District, senior facilities in Little Ferry and Teaneck are set to receive the highly competitive tax credits.  
This pandemic has placed unbearable pressure upon the shoulders of all Americans, but especially those in our most vulnerable communities. Now more than ever, the federal government must step in to support Americans in need of adequate housing. These tax credits are a game-changer for our seniors, impoverished families, and those in need of a home. Importantly, they will provide pivotal assistance to our neighbors most in need, including our seniors here in Bergen County. In Washington, I’ll continue fighting for every federal dollar available that supports New Jerseyans in search of a home. Housing is a right that no American should be without.
Celebrating House Passage of Water Resources Bill 
This week, the House of Representatives approved the bipartisan Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) (S. 1811). This legislation authorizes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers work on water resource projects to build and study new lock, damn, levee, and ecosystem projects throughout the nation. Included in the final bill are three items that I pushed for: (1) the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Report for the Hudson-Raritan Estuary (HRE) Ecosystem Restoration project of New Jersey which includes work in the Meadowlands, (2) the Peckman River Basin Flood Risk Management project Pascrell started twenty years ago, and (3) amendments to update the New York-New Jersey Harbor and Tributaries Study (HTS) to address damaging storm surges such as the one seen during Superstorm Sandy.
The passage of our bipartisan bill is proof positive of the support for ecosystem restoration and flood management in our waterlogged North Jersey communities. The Hudson-Raritan Ecosystem project will allow federal investment to restore marshland and habitat at two environmentally sensitive sites in our cherished Meadowlands. I have long worked assiduously with local officials and Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) to address dangerous flash flooding from the Peckman River that has caused major damage and loss of life. The House is focused on protecting communities like ours in North Jersey through forward-looking solutions that allow our communities to sufficiently manage major water events. 
Introducing Renewable Chemicals Act 
As a co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, I was glad to introduce the Renewable Chemicals Act, legislation that will create an allocated tax credit for production of qualifying renewable chemicals from biomass or investment in production facilities. It is imperative that America leads the world in combatting climate change and reducing dependence on fossil fuels. This bipartisan legislation, which I introduced with Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA), will help boost our production of renewable chemicals and clean energy, and decrease our dependence on the fossil fuel industry. 
Importantly, our bill emphasizes the need for job creation in these growing industries to ensure that American workers have the opportunities they deserve. Our children and our grandchildren deserve to inherit a world clean of fossil fuels and dirty energy sources. We have the means to make that goal a reality and it starts with this bill.

We are facing a global pandemic, and ensuring the safety of all families from COVID-19 and its impact on day-to-day life is my top priority. My office has prepared an informational webpage to ensure workers, families, businesses, and health care providers know their options for relief. You can always reach me and my staff in Washington at 202-225-5751 or New Jersey at 973-523-5152 for assistance or further guidance.

1/29/21 9:57,Boozman Bulletin: A Voice for the Voiceless,"Boozman Bulletin: A Voice for the Voiceless 
I’m proud to receive an A+ pro-life rating on the Susan B. Anthony List for my record promoting the value of life. Defending the most vulnerable among us is one of the most important things we can do because every life is precious. I am committed to protecting innocent and unborn children, supporting policies that end abortion and preventing groups participating in the destruction and devaluing of human life from receiving taxpayer dollars. We can be encouraged by how the pro-life movement continues to expand as we unite to defend the sanctity of human life. Today, people around the country will participate in the virtual March for Life rally and demonstrate their support for protecting the unborn. I’m lending my voice in support of this cause. 

  
This week I also helped re-introduce several pro-life bills including: 
	•	The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act: There is no clearer indication that America is in moral crisis than to understand that babies in the womb feel pain as early as 20 weeks old, yet are still allowed to be victims of gruesome abortion procedures that end their lives in agonizing fashion. Science and medical technology increasingly affirm this truth. It is past time for us to protect these innocent, vulnerable lives and spare them from that fate. I’m thankful my colleagues are standing together in support of this legislation that promotes the value and dignity of every human being.  
	•	No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act: Currently, policies that regulate federal funding for abortions, like the long-standing Hyde Amendment, have to be reapproved each year and could be terminated. This bill would eliminate the need for annual action and ensure a permanent, government-wide prohibition on funding for abortions.  
	•	Down Syndrome Discrimination by Abortion Prohibition Act: This legislation would prohibit abortion based on an unborn child having Down syndrome. Every life is a precious gift, and unborn babies diagnosed with Down syndrome are no exception. Every human being is capable of accomplishing amazing things that exceed expectations and add much value and joy to the lives and families they are fortunate to be part of. I am honored to stand up and speak out on their behalf and on behalf of those yet to be born so that they can realize their full potential and purpose. Our world would be less bright and loving without them.  
	•	Women’s Public Health and Safety Act: This legislation gives states the authority to exclude abortion providers, like Planned Parenthood, from receiving Medicaid funds. Under current law, states are required to allow any qualified provider to participate in a state’s Medicaid system. A non-partisan Government Accountability Office report revealed that Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.3 billion in Medicaid  reimbursements over a three-year period, accounting for 81 percent of the abortion provider’s joint federal-state funding stream.  
	•	Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act: This bill aims to protect newborns who survive an attempted abortion. It would create criminal penalties for doctors who allow infants surviving abortion to die rather than provide them medical care, and also require that born-alive abortion survivors be transported to a hospital for treatment.
_____________________________________________________________________________   Helping Businesses Comply with Immigration Laws   This week I helped introduce legislation that prevents illegal immigrants from taking jobs meant for American workers and legal immigrants while ensuring employers have the tools they need to certify a legal workforce. The Accountability Through Electronic Verification Act would permanently authorize and require employers to use the E-Verify program, an internet-based system that assists employers in determining the eligibility of employees allowed to work in the United States.   Employers need a commonsense, cost-effective tool that allows them to hire with confidence. Law enforcement must be empowered to hold bad actors accountable when they willfully violate immigration rules while hiring employees. E-Verify does both. It has a proven track record of success and should be permanently reauthorized and made mandatory for employers.   Currently, employers voluntarily submit information reported on an employee’s Form I-9 to the Department of Homeland Security through the E-Verify system, which works in partnership with the Social Security Administration to determine worker eligibility. There is no cost for employers to use E-Verify.   _____________________________________________________________________________   Economic Impact Payment Resources   Arkansans have a lot of questions about the Economic Impact Payment (EIP) that Congress approved at the end of 2020. The media often refers to these payments as ‘stimulus checks.'   The IRS has been issuing these payments. The best place to start in finding the status of a payment is the Get My Payment button on the IRS website. This will show if and when the payment was processed. It is important to note that it is taking approximately three to four weeks from that processing date to receive the payment. Arkansans with a January 6 date on the IRS website have told me they just received their check in the mail this week.  If the IRS website indicates the payment status is “unavailable” you may still be able to get one. The IRS added a line to this year’s tax forms so you can claim an unreceived EIP from both 2020 and 2021. You will have to file a tax return to see if there is any money through the Recovery Rebate Credit.    

  I understand this impacts many Arkansans who don’t normally file a tax return. If you need help with this to pursue your EIP, check out the file for free resources from the IRS or find the closest Volunteer Income Tax Assistance site.   _____________________________________________________________________________   Arkansas COVID-19 Vaccine Update   Arkansas is currently in Phase 1-B of its COVID-19 distribution plan. Educators who work in K-12, child care and higher education, individuals age 70 or older and all Arkansans eligible in Phase 1-A including health care workers, residents and staff at long-term care facilities and other high priority groups are qualified to receive the vaccine.     The Arkansas Department of Health has a helpful map showing locations around the state administering the vaccine. To learn more about the state’s vaccination plan click here.   Veterans enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) also have the option of receiving a vaccine from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical system. The VHA is following CDC vaccine distribution guidelines, which can differ from the state-by-state plans. Currently, the VA is vaccinating veterans who are 75 and older, those on dialysis, undergoing chemotherapy, have had a transplant or who are homeless.   Veterans will receive a call from the VA’s Vaccination Team to schedule their appointment when they are eligible.

Dear Friend,

Congress reached a bicameral, bipartisan agreement with the White House on an emergency coronavirus relief and government funding package to save lives and address the urgent needs of the American people. This agreement recognizes that we cannot get our economy working unless we can get the coronavirus under control and send much needed relief to those most impacted by the pandemic.

Here are a few highlights from the bipartisan package:

	•	Urgently needed funds to accelerate the free distribution of vaccines
	•	A new round of direct payments of $600 per adult and child
	•	An enhancement of Unemployment Insurance of $300 per week
	•	Additional funds for forgivable PPP loans for small businesses
	•	$82 billion in funding for schools and colleges, $10 billion for child care

See below for a more detailed summary of the bipartisan agreement and key higher education provisions included in the package.


Emergency Coronavirus Relief and Government Funding Package

The bipartisan agreement on emergency coronavirus relief includes many important provisions Democrats fought hard to secure. 

The package:

	•	Accelerates Vaccine Distribution to Crush the Coronavirus: Democrats secured billions in urgently needed funds to accelerate the free and equitable distribution of safe vaccines to as many Americans as possible as soon as possible. This funding also helps implement a strong national testing and tracing strategy with billions reserved specifically for combating the disparities facing communities of color and to support our heroic health care workers and providers. 
	•	Provides Direct Payments, Rent, Food, and Unemployment Money for the American People: Democrats secured another round of direct payments worth up to $600 per adult or child, averted the sudden expiration of Unemployment Insurance benefits for millions and added a $300 per week UI enhancement for Americans out of work, and lengthened the number of weeks an unemployed worker can receive benefits by 11 weeks. Direct payments could be available as soon as next week and will be sent to all Americans who received a payment earlier this year. Additionally, the bill includes critically needed emergency rental assistance, extends the federal eviction moratorium, provides a 15 percent increase to SNAP, and boosts child nutrition benefits to help relieve the historic hunger crisis that has left up to 17 million children food insecure. 
	•	Delivers Key Tax Benefits for Struggling Families: Democrats won improvements to the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit that help ensure that families who faced unemployment or reduced wages during the pandemic are able to receive a strong tax credit based on their 2019 income, preserving these vital income supports for vulnerable families. To support workers, the agreement extends and improves the Employee Retention Tax Credit to help keep workers in their jobs during coronavirus closures or reduced revenue and also provides a tax credit to support employers offering paid sick leave, based on the Families First framework. 
	•	Provides Strong Support for Small Businesses: Democrats secured critical funding and policy changes to help small businesses, including minority, women, and veteran owned small businesses. The agreement includes over $284 billion for first and second forgivable PPP loans, dedicates set-asides for very small businesses and lending through community-based lenders like CDFIs and MDIs, key modifications to PPP to serve the smallest businesses and struggling non-profits and better assist independent restaurants, $15 billion in dedicated funding for live venues, independent movie theaters, and cultural institutions and $20 billion for targeted EIDL Grants which are critical to many smaller businesses on Main Street. Additionally, businesses that received PPP loans will be able to take tax deductions for the expenses covered by forgiven loans, saving businesses about $200 billion. 
	•	Funds Education, Child Care, and Students: The agreement provides $82 billion in funding for colleges and schools, including support for HVAC repair and replacement to mitigate virus transmission and reopen classrooms, and $10 billion for child care assistance to help get parents back to work and keep child care providers open. The package includes the largest expansion of Pell Grant recipients in over a decade, reaching 500,000 new recipients and ensuring more than 1.5 million students will now receive the maximum benefit. 
	•	Delivers More Affordable Broadband Access: The agreement invests $7 billion to increase access to broadband, including a new Emergency Broadband Benefit to help millions of students, families and unemployed workers afford the broadband they need during the pandemic. 
	•	Secures Key Funding Streams for State and Local Governments: While state and local governments need much more funding to prevent the senseless layoffs of heroic essential workers and critical service cuts, Democrats won new targeted funds for state and local government functions that will help alleviate their overall budget burdens. These targeted funds include the emergency resources for schools, $27 billion for state highways, struggling transit agencies, Amtrak and airports, $22 billion for the health-related expenses of state, local, tribal and territorial government and an additional year of eligibility for expenses under the CARES Coronavirus Relief Fund. 
	•	Creates Good-Paying Jobs in Clean Energy and Infrastructure to Fight the Climate Crisis: The agreement includes sweeping clean energy reforms, R&D enhancements, efficiency incentives, extends clean energy tax credits and includes the bipartisan Water Resources Development Act of 2020, creating more good-paying jobs strengthening and improving the vital water infrastructure that Americans rely on. The package also phases out superpollutant HFCs, positioning the U.S. to lead the world in avoiding up to 0.5 degree Celsius of global warming. 
	•	Ends Surprise Billing: Patients deserve the peace of mind to know that, whether in an emergency or a planned in-network procedure, they will not be hit with crushing, surprise medical bills for out-of-network treatment beyond their control. The agreement includes bipartisan legislation that will end surprise bills for emergency and scheduled care, so patients are only responsible for their usual cost-sharing amounts and deductibles. With patients protected, the legislation establishes a fair process for health care providers and health plans to sort out the out-of-network costs between themselves, without the patient stuck in the middle. 
	•	Supports the Global Fight Against COVID: Democrats secured an additional $3.36 billion for a total of $4 billion for GAVI, the international vaccine alliance, recognizing that we are not truly safe until the whole world is safe from the coronavirus. 
 Key Higher Education Provisions  As Chair of the Higher Education and Workforce Investment Subcommittee, making college more affordable has been one of my top priorities. I’m proud to share that Congress also reached an exciting agreement on higher education that will make this a reality for millions of students.    Here are a few longstanding priorities we secured in the bill:  
	•	Expanding the Pell Grant program and making it easier for students to predict their eligibility, which will make hundreds of thousands of students newly eligible for Pell and increase award amounts for millions of current Pell recipients. 
	•	Making it easier for students to apply – and qualify – for federal student aid by streamlining the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) and expanding outreach and awareness activities to encourage FAFSA completion, with a focus on low-income students and families. 
	•	Expanding opportunities for justice-involved individuals to get an education and successfully reenter their communities by providing incarcerated students access to Pell Grants. 
	•	Discharging loans made to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) under the HBCU Capital Financing Loan program, providing $1.34 billion in relief.  
	•	Eliminating a confusing and punitive restriction that limits eligibility for subsidized federal loans among low-income students.  
	•	Restoring Pell Grant eligibility for defrauded students, including those who attended shuttered for-profit colleges like ITT Technical Institutes and Corinthian Colleges. 

This bipartisan agreement is an important step toward getting the American people the relief many have desperately needed for months. However, I recognize that much more needs to be done. The cost of living in San Diego is high and with many families struggling to put food on the table, I wish we could have provided more financial resources directly to families. 

I'm hopeful that my colleagues in the 117th Congress will continue to pass legislation to help families and small businesses survive this pandemic. And I'm confident that under the leadership of the Biden-Harris Administration, the federal government will move forward with a science-based approach to end the pandemic and get our economy back on track.

Although we fought hard for a better deal, I voted in support of this package to send immediate relief to all Americans.

Warm regards,



Susan A. Davis

May 29, 2021 
Dear Friends,  As many of us prepare to enjoy this Memorial Day weekend it’s important to remember the meaning of this national holiday, which is to honor the brave individuals who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our democracy. I had the privilege of joining several of my colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives for a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. We gathered at the gravesite of Corporal Frank Buckles, the longest-surviving American servicemember who fought in World War I, before visiting the graves of many other servicemembers who have died serving our great country. And even though many of us still may not be able to gather together this year, we can and must pay tribute to these heroes as well as their families and communities. Whether it’s in combat, in training, abroad or at home, we must never forget those who have laid their lives on the line to defend the American way of life.   Rest assured that congressional Democrats are dedicated to serving our constituents and country as we rebuild from the devastating physical, social, and economic fallout of the pandemic. We’re working with the Biden Administration to implement the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan and increasing further federal support for hardworking Americans and their families as well as the businesses and workers that are the backbone of our country. That includes addressing the catastrophic she-cession that has hit our hard-working women, who continue to suffer disproportionate job loss and struggle to get back into the workforce because they bear the greatest brunt of child care needs, and ensuring that everyone who is able to get vaccinated receives the COVID-19 vaccine.   Though the challenges that remain before us are daunting, I am confident that the remaining hurdles we face can be overcome as long as we are willing to unite in our shared desire to move forward. I’m also inspired by the willingness of my constituents and our fellow Americans to do their part in this historic effort to not just rebound from the pandemic and the previous four years, but to create a better and more just country that lives up to its ideals. That means remaining informed and engaged with verified, factual reporting. By taking the time to educate ourselves, we are restoring our government and society to one that relies on the knowledge of experts, recognizes the value of science, and is dedicated to serving all Americans.   Thank you for reading and all my best,

Memorial Day
The Library of Congress

The first national celebration of the holiday took place May 30, 1868, at Arlington National Cemetery, where both Confederate and Union soldiers were buried. Originally known as Decoration Day, at the turn of the century it was designated as Memorial Day. In many American towns, the day is celebrated with a parade.

Southern women decorated the graves of soldiers even before the Civil War’s end. Records show that by 1865, Mississippi, Virginia, and South Carolina all had precedents for Memorial Day. Songs in the Duke University collection Historic American Sheet Music include hymns published in the South such as these two from 1867: “Kneel Where Our Loves are Sleeping External,” dedicated to “The Ladies of the South Who are Decorating the Graves of the Confederate Dead ” and “Memorial Flowers External,” dedicated “To the Memory of Our Dead Heroes.”

When a women’s memorial association in Columbus, Mississippi, decorated the graves of both Confederate and Union soldiers on April 25, 1866, this act of generosity and reconciliation prompted an editorial piece, published by Horace Greeley’s New York Tribune, and a poem by Francis Miles Finch, “The Blue and the Grey,” published in the Atlantic Monthly. The practice of strewing flowers on soldiers’ graves soon became popular throughout the reunited nation.

President Lyndon Johnson proclaimed Waterloo, New York, as the “Birthplace of Memorial Day,” because it began a formal observance on May 5, 1866. However, Boalsburg, Pennsylvania, also claims to have held the first observance, based on an observance dating back to October 1864. Indeed, many other towns also lay claim to being the first to hold an observance.

In 1971, federal law changed the observance of the holiday to the last Monday in May and extended the honor to all soldiers who died in American wars. A few states continue to celebrate Memorial Day on May 30.

Immunity to the Coronavirus May Persist for Years, Scientists Find

Important immune cells survive in the bone marrow of people who were infected with the virus or were inoculated against it, new research suggests.
By Apoorva Mandavilli, The New York Times
Immunity to the coronavirus lasts at least a year, possibly a lifetime, improving over time especially after vaccination, according to two new studies. The findings may help put to rest lingering fears that protection against the virus will be short-lived.  Together, the studies suggest that most people who have recovered from Covid-19 and who were later immunized will not need boosters. Vaccinated people who were never infected most likely will need the shots, however, as will a minority who were infected but did not produce a robust immune response.  Both reports looked at people who had been exposed to the coronavirus about a year earlier. Cells that retain a memory of the virus persist in the bone marrow and may churn out antibodies whenever needed, according to one of the studies, published on Monday in the journal Nature.  The other study, posted online at BioRxiv, a site for biology research, found that these so-called memory B cells continue to mature and strengthen for at least 12 months after the initial infection.  To read the complete article, click here.  
Exclusive: Pandemic Could Cost Typical American Woman Nearly $600,000 in Lifetime Income
By Emily Peck, Newsweek
New signs of the nation's expanding recovery from the pandemic crop up every day, but for millions of women in the U.S. the economic punch of CCOVID may never be over. Long after the face masks have been tucked away and the kids are back in school full-time, after offices reopen, jobs are regained and life returns to some semblance of normalcy, the financial fallout of the past 15 months will continue to trail these women—likely, for the rest of their working lives and throughout retirement.  More than 4.5 million fewer women are employed now than at the start of the pandemic, either through layoffs in the female-dominated industries hit hardest by the virus or because they were pushed out of work to care for children home from school or daycare. Most of these women, research shows, are now also likely to earn less—perhaps, far less—in the future. During this period, they didn't get promotions. Or training. Or job opportunities. They lost seniority at work. And, when they return, employers are likely to regard them differently, less committed to their jobs, studies also show. These ingredients are a recipe for a lifetime of lower wages. That, in turn, will result in lower Social Security benefits and income from savings once they retire.  The potential long-term cost of this combination of losses for women—the income they've given up during the pandemic, plus the future income they'll miss out on, plus reduced retirement benefits—is enormous.  According to an analysis for Newsweek by economist Michael Madowitz of the Center for American Progress, a typical woman earning a median wage of $47,299 before the pandemic stands to lose more than a quarter of a million dollars in income over her lifetime, assuming she returns to full- time work by 2022; if she's out until 2024—that's how long the consulting firm McKinsey forecasts it will take for women's employment to get back to pre-pandemic levels—those losses could rise to nearly $600,000. For an average college-educated woman (median income: $62,140), the potential losses grow to $346,000 after two years out of the workforce and more than $785,000 after five years. And for those who were making a six-figure salary pre-COVID, the losses could top $1 million or more.  To read the complete article, please click here.  
Why QAnon is disappearing from online view
By Ashley Gold, Axios
Specific language about the QAnon conspiracy theory has all but disappeared from mainstream public social media platforms, new research concludes.  Driving the news: Researchers from the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensics Lab found that the volume of QAnon content available online plummeted following major moderation and policy moves from Google, Facebook and Twitter.  Details: Researchers analyzed more than 45 million mentions of QAnon catchphrases and related terms from April 1, 2020 to April 1, 2021 on both mainstream platforms and alternative ones such Gab and Parler.  Terms included popular QAnon phrases including ""the storm,"" ""the great awakening,"" ""save the children"" and ""WWG1WGA (Where we go one we go all)."" Those terms started being used more frequently online in March 2020, peaked in June 2020 around racial justice protests, and spiked again before the January 6 Capitol riot.  To read the complete article, click here.

APRIL NEWSLETTER
Dear Friend,  With the month of April now in our rear view mirror, I just wanted to take a few minutes to update you on a few noteworthy events and actions that I have taken as your elected representative in Congress.  
Below, is but a brief snapshot of those efforts both in Philadelphia and in Washington, DC.  
————————————————————
In April, I was honored to present Black Doctors COVID Consortium founder Dr. Ala Stanford with a Congressional Citation recognizing Dr. Stanford's groundbreaking outreach and humanitarian efforts in administering COVD-19 tests and vaccines to Philadelphia’s black and underserved communities during this pandemic.

———————————————————— 
“We chose this location because of all of the zip codes in Philadelphia, this zip code has the highest positivity rate.” -Rep. Brendan Boyle (PA-02)  
My health fair in late April successfully vaccinated hundreds with the COVID-19 vaccine. I’d like to extend a sincere thanks to Bishop Millicent Hunter for allowing us to use The Baptist Worship Center for this health fair event, and many thanks also to Rite Aid for providing the vaccines that are now saving lives!   
Get vaccinated!  Wear a mask!  We will get through this together! 

———————————————————— 
In April, I joined forces with the faith based community in North Philadelphia to open a second FEMA run Community Vaccination Center at the Esperanza campus in Hunting Park. 
 Many people in the neighborhoods surrounding Esperanza just couldn't make it all the way down to the Convention Center's FEMA vaccination site. So, I wanted to fix that. Esperanza founder Rev. Luis Cortes and I lobbied FEMA to consider the Esperanza campus as a potential site.  
I'm proud to report that our efforts proved successful! 
Nearly 850,000 Philadelphians live within 5 minutes of the new Esperanza Community Vaccination Center. This site resulted in thousands of more vaccines in arms every day. I was extremely proud to have worked with Rev. Cortes and his Esperanza team in getting this community vaccination site over the finish line.  

———————————————————— 
We fought for more vaccines and we got them!  
In late April, FEMA agreed to send more vaccines to the City of Philadelphia after we (myself, Sen. Casey, Reps. Evans & Scanlon) called on the White House to demand that FEMA continue providing vaccines at the Philly Convention Center site. 
Every dose counts as we emerge successfully from this pandemic! 

———————————————————— 
 In April, I also presented Mr. Terrill Haigler with an official Congressional Citation. 
Mr. Haigler, better known to his 25,000+ Instagram followers as @_YaFavTrashman , is a frontline City of Philadelphia Sanitation Worker who uses his social media platform to make the world a better place. Throughout this pandemic, Terrill regularly updated Philadelphians about trash pickup schedules, collection delays, and how to stay safe during the pandemic. 
Through it all, he did it with humor, sincere compassion, and a professional dedication that should serve as a model for others. I was honored to present Terrill with this award, and wish him continued success in his mission to make the world a better place.

———————————————————— 
In April, I hosted my first IRS tax and stimulus payment webinar. 
Many thanks to Kate Hunyady from the IRS for joining me to answer many great questions regarding the 2020 tax filing season and how stimulus payments fit into those filing efforts. Remember, for any tax related issues, the best way to get up to date information is to contact my office at 215-335-3355 or via the web at www.boyle.house.gov.

1/24/21 10:02,Inauguration,"INAUGURATION 

President Trump spent the last four years fighting for our great nation. I thank him for his service, and I'm proud of what we accomplished. 

This week, Joe Biden was sworn in as President of the United States and the world witnessed the peaceful transition of power. Now more than ever, America needs unity to address the many challenges we face. 

Unfortunately, as soon as the President was sworn-in, he signed executive orders to revoke the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, weaken our border security and more. Crushing the progress made over the last four years will threaten American jobs and further divide our nation.

I am committed to finding common ground to move our country forward, and I call on the new Administration to do the same. 

We discuss the inauguration and this week in Washington on this episode of Buddy's Briefing.

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCXCVI

Monday, January 18, 2021:  On Saturday I attended the funeral of Ware County Sheriff Randy Royal who died at the young age of 57 last week.  Sheriff Royal started his law enforcement career in 1980 as a dispatcher at the sheriff’s office and worked his way up to being elected Sheriff in 2009 and re-elected to a fourth four-year term last November.  One of the true nice guys, Sheriff Royal’s funeral was attended by numerous law enforcement officers and a number of sheriffs in the region who worked with him.  A lifelong resident of Ware County, Sheriff Royal loved the community and the community loved him.  He will be greatly missed.  Today we celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  While most of the parades have been cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of virtual celebrations are held throughout the First District.  Dr. King visited the First District many times during his life and was particularly fond of Savannah.  A link to a video honoring Dr. King’s birthday can be found here.  This morning, I have a briefing with the Chief of the National Guard Bureau on preparations for the Presidential Inauguration later this week.  Because of the COVID-19 pandemic and heightened security, this inauguration will be much different from those in the past.  Later in the day, I have a virtual interview with WSB-TV in Atlanta to discuss the upcoming inauguration and my plans to attend.  A link to my interview can be found here.

Tuesday, January 19, 2021:  After our daily all-staff conference call, I head to the airport for my flight to Washington and have a press conference with local media to discuss my attendance at the inauguration as well as other issues.  A link to my interviews can be found here and here.  Once in Washington, I head to the Pentagon with my special guest as we are required to have a COVID-19 test in order to gain admission to the event tomorrow.  Once I arrive at the Capitol, I am greeted by eight foot fences with razor wire at the top surrounding the Capitol with thousands of National Guard troops and Capitol Hill Police monitoring the grounds.  While the heightened security is understandable as a result of the events of January 6, the optics are certainly alarming.   

Wednesday, January 20, 2021:  I’m on the radio early this morning with my good friend Bill Edwards on NewsTalk 1290 as we discuss the inauguration and the events of January 6th.  Later, I meet my special guest for the inauguration, Dr. Karla Sapp, outside the gates and escort her into the Capitol.  Born and raised in Midway in Liberty County, I met Dr. Sapp while she was working with the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) in Jesup in Wayne County where she was the coordinator of the drug rehabilitation program. 

Rep. Carter at the inauguration with his guest Dr. Karla Sapp
Dr. Sapp is a licensed professional counselor and was named the 2020 Mental Health Advocate of the Year by the Black Mental Health Symposium.  Mental health issues are one of our primary focuses on the Health Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce (E&C) Committee that I serve on in Congress.  After checking in with other members of Congress and their guests, Dr. Sapp and I are escorted to the western lawn of the Capitol where we are led to our seats.  While waiting for the ceremony to begin, Dr. Sapp and I meet other members of Congress and their guests and she is able to renew acquaintances with members of her sorority, Delta Sigma Theta.  The weather is frigid with even a few light snow flurries, but the atmosphere is exciting as we witness the swearing in of the 46th President of the United States, Joe Biden, and the first African American and Asian American female Vice-President, Kamala Harris.  Along with the pomp and pageantry, we also witness performances by Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez and Garth Brooks.  The event is a success, without incident and certainly one that Dr. Sapp and I will remember for many years.  Later, I have a virtual interview with WJCL-TV in Savannah followed by a virtual interview with Fox 28 in Savannah to discuss my inaugural experiences.  A link to my interviews can be found here and here.  

Thursday, January 21, 2021:  My morning starts with an interview on C-SPAN as I discuss the inauguration and COVID-19 vaccine rollout as well as other topics.  A link to my interview can be found here.  Afterwards, I head to the Capitol Visitors Center (CVC) for a GOP organizing meeting of the E&C Committee where we receive our subcommittee assignments for the session. 

Rep. Carter appears on C-SPAN
Once again, I will be serving on the Health and Environment & Climate Change Subcommittees and this session, I will be adding the Communications and Technology Subcommittee.  These are great assignments and I am excited and eager to begin.  Afterwards, I head back to my office where I join in on our daily all-staff conference call before heading to the western lawn of the Capitol where they are beginning to dismantle the inauguration platform and where I film this week’s edition of Buddy’s Briefing.  After returning to my office, I head to the House Chamber where I speak on the upcoming waiver vote for Gen. Lloyd Austin.  Gen. Austin, a Thomasville, GA, native and former member of the 3rd ID, has been nominated for Secretary of Defense, a position that requires a former military member to be retired for seven years.  Because Gen. Austin has only been retired four years, he must have a waiver in order to be eligible.  A link to my speech in favor of granting the waiver to Gen. Austin can be found here.  Afterwards, I remain in the House Chamber for the vote where Gen. Austin is granted the waiver.  Next, I head to the airport for my return trip home. 

Friday, January 22, 2021:  After a phone interview with a reporter from the Coastal Courier in Hinesville to discuss my experiences at the inauguration, I head to our Savannah office where I meet with a constituent concerning the November election before meeting with a group of supporters of the Fair Tax legislation that I am sponsoring this session. 

Rep. Carter meeting with supporters of the Fair Tax
Afterwards, I film a pro-life video before heading out and ending what has been a very busy week.

4/5/21 8:08,April Newsletter Update from Congressman Tim Burchett,"Newsletter Update - April 2021

Burchett announces new “moonshot” economic initiative, presses Biden administration to investigate ActBlue, casts votes against taxpayer-funded campaigns and amnesty for 3 million illegal immigrants  


***NOTE: Please do not respond directly to this email. If you would like to respond to this mailing, click here to send me an email through my official website.*** 

Hello Lindsey,

I hope you are doing well and staying safe. March was a busy month, and I split my time between Washington and the 2nd Congressional District. The highlight of the month was the launch of my new “moonshot” economic initiative at the Kern’s Bakery redevelopment site on March 31.  


My economic initiative has three pillars: access to capital, government efficiency, and criminal justice reform. By focusing on these areas, we can spur investment and revitalization in under-served and often forgotten areas of urban and rural America. There are currently three bills in my plan, which you can read about in the graphic below. Moving forward, I’ll continue to identify and introduce additional legislation that responsibly leverages government resources. 


Immediately before I announced this initiative, I held an economic development roundtable with local elected officials and entrepreneurs. In addition to the policies outlined above, we specifically discussed Opportunity Zones and the barriers facing East Tennessee communities when trying to take advantage of this program. Thank you to everyone who attended. 



Back in Washington, the federal government continues to grapple with the crisis at the southern border. Thousands of people are attempting to illegally enter the country every day, some who have tested positive for COVID-19 and others who are involved in drug and human trafficking. We need to demagnetize our southern border, but instead House Democrats held a vote on a bill that rewards folks who break our immigration laws with amnesty. I voted against this bill that could make this dangerous crisis worse and sends the wrong message to those currently trying to enter the country. 


The House also considered H.R. 1, a massive piece of legislation that gives Washington bureaucrats more control over elections in Tennessee. This bill eliminates voter ID requirements and legalizes ballot harvesting, but worst of all it funds campaigns for federal office with taxpayer dollars. This means your tax dollars could go towards funding Nancy Pelosi’s re-election campaign. H.R. 1 is nothing more than an unconstitutional big government power grab, and I sounded off on the problems with this bill during an interview with Newsmax on March 4. Click here or on the image below to watch.  


It was recently brought to my attention the online fundraiser ActBlue is allowing the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI), a pro-Boycott, Divest, and Sanctions (BDS) group to raise money on its platform. BDS is an anti-Semitic movement that seeks to harm Israel, our strongest ally in the Middle East, through terrorism.

I am concerned money donated to PACBI through ActBlue could be trickling down to terrorist organizations. ActBlue could be breaking federal law if it is knowingly allowing this to happen, so I wrote a letter to the Department of Justice and Department of Treasury urging them to investigate this serious issue. You can read my full letter here.    


Thank you to everyone who participated in my live telephone town hall event on March 16. It was great connecting with East Tennesseans! 


My official website currently features a COVID-19 resources page with important information on available federal economic relief for small businesses and individuals, as well as best practices for staying healthy during the pandemic. I also encourage you to visit the State of Tennessee’s COVID-19 resource page, which includes important information on vaccines and testing sites.

2/13/21 10:06,Weekly Update: U.S. Attorneys Should Be Allowed To Conclude Their Important Work,"Weekly Update | February 13, 2021
 

U.S. Attorneys Should Be Allowed To Conclude Their Important Work

While U.S. Attorneys ultimately serve at the pleasure of the President, I believe it would be reckless and irresponsible for President Biden to fire U.S. Attorneys John Lausch, of the Northern District of Illinois, and John Milhiser, of the Central District of Illinois, without successors nominated and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. U.S. Attorney Lausch is currently pursuing a historic and major public corruption investigation involving a years-long bribery scheme that has implicated former House Speaker Michael Madigan and others. U.S. Attorney Milhiser recently announced an indictment against former State Senator Sam McCann for criminal charges, including fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion.
 
There is precedent for allowing a U.S. Attorney to remain in office until successors are confirmed, and I strongly believe both should be allowed to do so. I urge President Biden to permit U.S. Attorneys Lausch and Milhiser to remain in their jobs to conclude their ongoing corruption investigations and criminal cases.

Talking With K-12 School Administrators on Re-Opening
 

Pictured above: I talked with K-12 school administrators during a virtual listening session on Wednesday, February 10th 

On Wednesday, I hosted a Virtual COVID-19 Listening Session with K-12 School Administrators with two dozen school districts from across the 13th Congressional District participating. The discussion focused on the status of each district's transition back to in-person learning and what needs to happen to accomplish that transition. There were three common issues raised by local school administrators: funding, vaccines, and public health guidance. 

The vast majority of schools across my district are providing full-time or at least partial in-person learning and I am grateful for the administrators, teachers, and students for making that happen. I represent both rural and urban school districts and recognize they face different sets of challenges, but it is important we all work together to get schools reopened. 

I voted for additional federal funding for schools and vaccine distribution in December and that funding is on the way. Our kids deserve the best learning environment we can give them. That is undeniably in-person instruction and the science shows we can make that happen sooner rather than later.

Talking With County Health Departments on COVID-19 Vaccine Administration
 

Pictured above: I listened to county health department administrators during a virtual listening session on Monday, February 8th

On Monday, I hosted a Virtual COVID-19 Listening Session with County Health Departments with most all department administrators across the 13th Congressional District participating. The discussion focused on vaccine administration, testing operations, and contact tracing. Bolstering vaccine supply, funding to get shots in arms, and earlier notification of dosage allotments to improve planning were the main areas local leaders indicated they need support from the state and federal government. 

Our local county health departments are doing an admirable job of getting vaccines administered while still continuing testing and contact tracing operations. I heard clear and consistently that departments need more vaccines, further advance communication of allotments for planning purposes, and additional funding to get shots into arms. 

In December I voted for legislation that included billions of dollars for purchasing vaccines and distributing them. I will continue to listen to our public health officials leading the fight against the pandemic to see how we can best support their efforts. The sooner we get people vaccinated the sooner we can get back to normal. 

I continue to urge the Governor to take steps necessary to get shots into arms. With hard-working, capable county health department staff like the folks I spoke to yesterday there is no reason our state should be ranked at the tail-end of most vaccination measures.

Editorial: ""Biden Sacks a Corruption Prober""

President Joe Biden and his Department of Justice announced their intent to terminate dozens of U.S. Attorneys across the country, including John Lausch of the Northern District of Illinois. Editorial boards and lawmakers from both parties urged President Biden to allow Lausch to stay on the job until he concludes his work and a successor is confirmed.

From the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board: Biden Sacks a Corruption Prober: 

“A new President abruptly fires a prosecutor overseeing high-level political corruption cases. That’s big news, right? Well, it was in 2017 when President Trump axed Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York at the time and a media favorite. You can tell power in Washington has changed hands because of the muted response as the Biden White House ousts U.S. Attorney John Lausch of the Northern District of Illinois.
 
“Joe Biden is swiftly pushing out almost all U.S. attorneys who served under his predecessor, which is increasingly the norm for new Presidents. But even Illinois Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, staunch allies of Mr. Biden, objected to his firing of Mr. Lausch, who has been a scourge of corruption in Democratic-dominated Springfield.
 
“…Mr. Lausch’s corruption probes have implicated a Chicago alderman and Springfield politicians. In July 2020 his office announced a $200 million settlement with the state’s primary electric utility company for its efforts to buy off “associates of a high-level elected official for the state of Illinois.”
 
“That official is reported to be Michael Madigan, who until last month had been Speaker of the Illinois House for all but two years since 1983. The investigation is continuing, and there’s no reason outside of politics that Mr. Lausch shouldn’t be kept on the job until the Senate confirms a successor. Mr. Lausch’s four-year term ends in November 2021, and getting a replacement could take that long…”

From the Chicago Tribune Editorial Board: President Biden: Keep our U.S. Attorney John Lausch: 

“President Joe Biden’s Justice Department dismissed U.S. attorneys across the country appointed by former President Donald Trump on Tuesday, and Northern District of Illinois U.S. Attorney John Lausch appears to be out. That would be a terrible decision by Biden.
 
“…And what a coincidence that the politicians indicted, charged or under investigation so far happen to be mostly Democrats. Dismissing Lausch will look like a Biden-Durbin-Duckworth favor to their corrupt Democrat pals.
 
“…Lausch also has been helping Mayor Lori Lightfoot in Chicago with violent crime. The effort known as Operation Legend, which fanned across several U.S. cities to battle increases in crime, was credited as of last fall with 262 charges of firearm offenses in the Northern District, a number 33% higher than 2018 and 48% higher than 2017, according to the Trump Justice Department.”

4/9/21 18:16,The Monthly Update from Rep. Madison Cawthorn,"Dear Friend,
 
The COVID-19 vaccine, which came about through the Trump Administration’s Operation Warp Speed – an unprecedented public-private partnership with the nation’s best doctors and scientists, continues to be the best way to put this health and economic crisis behind us. Congress took steps this month to speed the deployment of the vaccine, but much more needs to be done particularly in rural areas like ours in Western North Carolina.

Unfortunately, the fight against COVID-19 faces a new challenge in the form of the Biden Administration’s misguided “vaccine passport” proposal. Under this proposal, the federal government would essentially tell states and the private sector what they must do to allow Americans to travel and attend large gatherings.

If enacted, this system would constitute a grievous violation of our personal liberties and would slow, rather than expedite, the vaccination process nationwide. Americans will be rightfully reluctant to get vaccinated if they believe the federal government is taking steps to track their health status. Moreover, a passport system will incentivize younger, healthy, travelers to get vaccinated more quickly than older, less healthy, and mobile Americans who are at greater risk.

Governor Ron DeSantis of Florida recently issued an executive order banning vaccine passports in his state. DeSantis said, “It’s completely unacceptable for either the government or the private sector to impose upon you the requirement that you show proof of vaccine to just simply be able to participate in normal society.”

The North Carolina congressional delegation should urge Governor Roy Cooper to issue a similar executive order in our state. I’ll keep you posted on this discussion in this coming days and weeks.
 
As we get through these difficult times together, I wanted to update you on what my team and I have accomplished this month:
 
From Washington:
 
I introduced several bills this month. First, my team and I introduced the Better Businesses for Tomorrow Act. This bill empowers small businesses impacted by government-mandated shutdowns by providing a payroll tax credit for businesses that provide COVID training to their employees. Small businesses should not have to foot the bill to reopen safely. The federal government shut down our economy, and the federal government ought to foot the bill to help reopen the economy. 
 
I also introduced the SPF Act. This act finally ends the yearly forwards/backward time-change cycle. Arbitrarily changing the time each year makes no sense and results in significant economic burdens for businesses, including those in NC-11. 
 
Just last week I introduced a bill to terminate certain executive actions enacted by the Biden Administration that have created a crisis at the southern border. This act will return the rule of law and restore our immigration system's stability, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 
I also introduced the Common-Sense Census Act of 2021. This bill requires a question to be included in the census that asks the respondent whether they and the household members are a citizen of the U.S. and requires that only U.S. citizens are included in congressional apportionment considerations. This bill would equip Congress with the tools needed to adequately reform our immigration system.
 
Additionally, I'm a co-sponsor of the common-sense immigration bill, Sarah's Law. This law would require immigration authorities to keep illegal immigrants in law enforcement's custody if they are accused of killing someone or inflicting severe bodily injury. As the Biden Administration's border crisis rages on, we have to pass sensible immigration bills which secure our border and protect our communities. 
 
I co-sponsored a number of bills that would effectively support our district and solve some of the complex economic issues we face. I co-sponsored the Main Street Tax Certainty Act. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation will help our NC-11 ""Main Street"" businesses by making the ""20% pass-through"" small business tax deduction permanent. I will always support small businesses, especially those in need during economically challenging times such as now. 
 
I am also an original co-sponsor of important legislation introduced by my colleague Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX) that places veteran's choice first. This bill benefits our veterans in NC-11 by slashing bureaucracy and empowering patients to engage with their healthcare providers. Additionally, I'm an original co-sponsor of the 2021 version of the PAWS for Veterans Therapy Act. The research is consistent and clear: canine therapy service programs dramatically increase our veterans' mental health and overall well-being. This bill is a step towards honoring their sacrifice. 
 
I'm also an original co-sponsor of the Students Before Unions Act. This bill promotes increased transparency in our NC-11 school system. A parent's role in child education is of paramount importance. Parents deserve to be involved in decisions that impact their students. This bill empowers parents in our great district. 
 
I am an original co-sponsor of the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act or REINS Act of 2021. This bill asserts Congress's role in the approval of new ""major rules"" proposed by federal agencies prior to them taking effect. Major regulatory changes by any federal agency have a drastic effect on millions of Americans, and can drastically impact our district. This bill allows for Congressional oversight, which will act as a safeguard, so our communities are protected. 
 
I'm also an original co-sponsor of the Death Tax Repeal Act. This bill directly impacts NC-11 by supporting small businesses; allowing them to grow operations, invest in human capital, and improve technology instead of worrying about a large estate tax. 

I co-sponsored H.R. 2047, which amends Title 38, United States Code, expanding eligibility for post-9/11 educational assistance for our National Guard HEROES. Those who perform these courageous full-time duties should be receiving these benefits.
 
This past month, I also wrote several official letters to lawmakers in NC-11 and worked with local leaders to address pressing concerns in our district. I heard our in-district veterans were experiencing long reimbursement delays for their travel pay. These delays were seriously impacting their quality of life, and their ability to travel in a timely manner. Our veterans deserve better so I wrote a letter to the VA firmly urging them to address this issue immediately. 
 
Regarding COVID, I signed on to a letter to the CDC expressing concerns about their inconsistent COVID-19 prevention strategies and requesting an accurate framework, and timeline to open our schools. I signed a letter to Secretary Mayorkas addressing reports indicating that COVID-19 positive illegal immigrants are being bussed from Texas to North Carolina, among other troubling reports at the southern border crisis under the Biden Administration. I also joined my colleagues in writing to the IRS & Dept. of the Treasury, asking them to follow the 2020 precedent and extend the tax filing date from the April 15th deadline to June 15th, 2021, due to COVID-19. This change benefits many in Western North Carolina. 
 
On other matters, I signed a bicameral letter to Speaker Pelosi addressing her outrageously partisan actions, as Speaker, to rob Iowans of their votes electing Rep. Miller-Meeks. I recently signed a letter to President Biden regarding the lack of transparency and media access at the border. The current conditions of this border crisis continue to worsen and show no sign of improvement. Thousands of unaccompanied children, COVID outbreaks, and plastic cages are simply unacceptable. In Washington, D.C., our National Guard languished under poor conditions and were being served contaminated food, I signed on to a letter to the Acting SEC of the Army and the Chief of the National Guard Bureau addressing the abundance of reports we'd received regarding the National Guard's food conditions. I am happy to report that those conditions have significantly improved.
 
Below are videos of statements I gave on the House floor, as well as commentary from my office. I spoke out in defense of election integrity, the right to work, the 2nd Amendment and many other crucial topics. 

Election Integrity
 
The Right to Work
 
Breaking Down the Right to Work and the PRO Act

2nd Amendment Statement 

Big Tech Censorship

H.R. 1195
 
The Better Businesses For Tomorrow Act

From NC-11:
 
Although Congress was in session for a good portion of this month, I spent as much time in our district as possible.
 
I had the privilege of visiting Hot Springs Health Program in Marshall, NC. These amazing people have been instrumental in distributing the COVID-19 vaccinations to our community and working hard for the people of Madison County.
 
I had a fantastic meeting with Patrick Ellis, NC Rep. Dudley Greene and McDowell County's Commissioners. I am happy to hear that McDowell County officially designated April 1st as the County's Broadband Day. This day provides awareness on the important issue of broadband access and availability. 
 
I had the opportunity to meet with N.C. State Representative Jake Johnson and other N.C. officials, who are working with me in the fight to protect our election integrity and best represent our constituents.
 
I had a great meeting with the President of North Carolina's Community Colleges, Thomas Stithe III. Together we are working to provide the best education possible for students in NC-11.
 
I met with North Carolina Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson, we discussed a plethora of topics regarding how we can best work together to advocate for our shared constituency. Including election integrity. I am so proud to work with him.

2/1/21 11:56,Weekly Update,"Dear West Virginian,  Yesterday, I joined a group of my Republican colleagues in the Senate and wrote to President Joe Biden to propose an alternative COVID-19 relief proposal. Our proposal reflects many of the already stated priorities by the administration, and we believe it is capable of garnering bipartisan support, which is necessary during this process. We also requested a meeting with the president to discuss the proposal in more detail. Shortly after sending the letter, my colleagues and I accepted an invitation from President Biden to meet with him at the White House today. As the process continues, I’ll be sure to keep you updated on the latest.  Speaking Up Against Executive Overreach   Last week, President Joe Biden issued several climate Executive Actions that signal America is heading backwards from energy independence toward reliance on foreign sources. Many of these decisions that were announced should be made in Congress, not dictated from a presidential order. This type of government overreach leaves rural communities and union workers in the dust, just ask those who were working on the Keystone XL pipeline. In West Virginia, we remember the effects of this playbook originally created during the Obama administration. America is a proud energy producer, and paralyzing an entire industry full of high-paying jobs and propping up hostile countries with fewer environmental regulations does little to combat global climate change and creates resentment at home.  I spoke more about these Executive Orders and my concerns on the Senate floor. Click here or below to watch.     Questioning Cabinet Nominees   I have begun conversations with some of President Biden’s potential nominees. My goal with all of these discussions has been and remains to find common ground to advance West Virginia interests and priorities. Recently, I had the opportunity to question two of President Biden’s picks to lead the Department of Transportation (DOT), Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Department of Commerce, Governor Gina Raimondo.      During both of these opportunities, I raised everything from Corridor H to the development of Virgin Hyperloop to broadband mapping to COVID-19 relief funding.  Check out my full questioning for Mayor Buttigieg here and here to watch my questions for Governor Raimondo.  Sharing West Virginia with the World       In case you missed it, the New River Gorge is now officially a National Park and Preserve! This is great news for our state, and there is no question that this designation will boost tourism and economic development in the area. Since the news has spread, people across the country have been buzzing with excitement to visit this beautiful spot right here in our backyard. Check out these articles in The Washington Post, Thrillist, Washingtonian, and Southern Living. I also penned an op-ed with Senator Joe Manchin in the Beckley Register-Herald.  COVID-19 Vaccinations in West Virginia   West Virginia has led the nation in distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and seeks to continue this effort. We have successful established vaccination sites in every one of our 55 counties and also had the first online state vaccination registration system in the nation. This success has been noticed nationwide. Check out these stories in the The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.   Now that we have shown we have the capability and the infrastructure to rapidly administer doses and given our large elderly population, it is essential the Biden administration prioritize West Virginia for additional doses in the future rounds of COVID-19 vaccine distribution. On Thursday, I worked with the other members of our Congressional Delegation to write a letter to Acting Secretary of Health and Human Services Norris Cochran and Acting Secretary of Defense David Norquist to request additional vaccines to West Virginia. See our full letter here.  If you would like to register for an appointment to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, Governor Justice has launched a website to assist with the process. Learn more here.  West Virginia Veterans Upward Bound  Do you have a veteran in your life who is looking to pursue higher education opportunities or brush up on their skills? West Virginia Veterans Upward Bound is dedicate to providing service to veterans in our state, and they are currently looking for referrals for their programs. Whether you’re looking to improve your computer skills, financial literacy, complete a new degree, or seek assistance with financial aid, WVVUB is here to help. Learn more here: https://vubwv.org/   Additional COVID-19 Resources  I created a page on my website with information and resources to keep you up-to-date on the coronavirus situation as it continues to evolve. For example, checks and debit cards are on the way to those eligible as a result of the relief package we passed recently. Check out that page here, and please share with friends so they can keep up with the latest.  In addition to my webpage, I also want to make sure you know where to get the latest updates from the medical experts at CDC.gov and West Virginia DHHR.  I will continue doing my best to keep you up to speed on what we are doing here at the federal level to help and other resources that can be useful back at home. I will be posting regular updates on my Facebook and Twitter accounts, so be sure to follow me there.    Important Information If You’re Visiting DC   Because of coronavirus concerns, all Capitol and White House tours have been suspended indefinitely. Please contact our Washington office to reschedule. Additionally, requests for flags flown over the Capitol may be delayed, and access to the Capitol and House and Senate office buildings is being restricted. Feel free to contact our office at (202) 224-6472 with any questions. We apologize for any inconvenience.  How Can We Help?   Whether you need help with a casework issue or have a question about scheduling a meeting at one of my offices, my staff and I are ready to assist you. Learn more about the services we offer at www.capito.senate.gov.  You can also submit your feedback and share your stories with me by visiting my “Share Your Stories” webpage here: www.capito.senate.gov/ShareYourStories.  Social Media Recap

12/1/20 19:03,News From the Tenth District,"Message from Representative Brad Schneider 
 
News From the Tenth District
I hope you and your family had a Happy Thanksgiving and everyone in your circle are healthy and safe.  I was very fortunate to be able to have my oldest son home for a few weeks and we met our younger son halfway between our home in Deerfield and St. Louis, where he’s a zookeeper, for an outside, socially distanced but delicious turkey feast. Wednesday also happened to be our 31st wedding anniversary so it was especially nice to be together (while still watching our spacing apart).   
As COVID cases continue to surge, I was particularly thankful this Thanksgiving for the dedicated frontline health care workers – the doctors, nurses, techs and everyone else caring for patients; the hospital administrators, custodians, administrative assistants, and others that make that care possible. To them, our entire community owes a deep debt of immense gratitude for their selfless work caring for all of us. 
While the rest of us enjoyed the beautiful summer, our healthcare heroes were preparing for the surge we now face. They are performing superhuman acts day in and day out. 
Sadly, we are seeing more cases, more illness, and more deaths. Our health care workers experience each of these cases personally, and I can only imagine the emotional and professional pressure laid upon them. I also know each of them are making enormous sacrifices at home as well. Many of them are working long, grinding shifts. Many of them won’t be able to see loved ones this holiday season. These sacrifices must certainly carry unbearable weight after months of tireless work. 
At the beginning of this pandemic, we all watched viral videos of people cheering out their windows to health care workers returning home from their long shifts. As the months have passed, it can feel that America’s collective appreciation for the same work has waned, that the tedious nature of combatting a pandemic has dulled our vigor, or that we are suffering from “COVID fatigue.” I hope that we can all come together and thank the health care workers in our life, as if still cheering out our windows, particularly in this season of thanks. 
Please continue reading for an update on COVID-19 in our communities, the Presidential transition and inauguration, and good news about a compromise COVID Relief proposal. 
  
COVID IN THE DISTRICT 
Like you, I’m more than ready to put this pandemic behind us. I wish that COVID-19 cases were not rising and we could return to life as normal.  But wishing does not make it so. We must stay determined to behave safely. 
Lake and Cook Counties remains at ‘orange’ COVID-19 risk level on the IDPH County Level Risk Metrics Map and Region 9 remains in Tier 3 mitigation under the state's Restore Illinois Resurgence Plan. 
This last week, Illinois lost the more lives to COVID than any other state in the nation. In total, Illinois has recorded more than 727,796 COVID cases and, tragically, 13,007 COVID-related deaths. Cook County reported 23,324 new cases last week. In Lake County, we have seen 3,140 new cases in just the last seven days. 
As the cold weather approaches, it’s critical that we work together to turn the curve back downward. Remind your family, your friends, coworkers and neighbors: follow the three W’s—wear a mask, wash your hands and watch your distance. It will not only save lives but will help us fully reopen our economy sooner, get people back to work, and hopefully next year get back to our normal lives. We can see the end of this crisis, so please, let’s stay diligent and work together to beat back the virus and get on the road to recovery. 
If you think you might have COVID or possibly have been exposed to someone who has, please get tested [Lake County] [Cook County]. Waukegan is offering free testing for all county residents with a site located on Water St. In Arlington Heights, you can get tested at the Arlington Racetrack. In North Chicago, you can go to the Lake County Health Department Respiratory Illness Clinic for a test by appointment. And Advocate Aurora Health System is offering COVID-19 testing. 
  
Assistance is Available 
In these difficult times, many Americans are struggling. 
If you or someone you know needs food, you can find your nearest food pantry or program here. If you have a problem with unemployment or other state issues, please contact your state elected official. Another excellent resource is 211 Lake County, operated by the United Way. 
If you live in Cook County and need help paying your mortgage due to the Coronavirus pandemic, you can apply for mortgage assistance here through Cook County.
Qualifying Cook County constituents can get a one-time $600 payment for COVID assistance through the Cook County Government. If you have experienced hardship due to unpaid leave, care for vulnerable or infected relatives, or loss of wages due to business or school closures, please consider applying. If you are dealing with an eviction or debt issue or are behind on your mortgage or property tax payments, Cook County residents can receive free legal aid through the Cook County Legal Aid for Housing and Debt, a county-wide initiative to help resolve eviction, foreclosure, debt, and tax deed issues.
Currently, Zion Township has access to CARE Act funding that will assist with COVID-19 related financial needs. The application deadline is December 15th. If you or someone you know is struggling with rent, a mortgage payment, or paying an electric bill, Zion Township may be able to help. 
  
More Help for Small Businesses Available 
I wanted to share an update highlighting that a second round of the time-sensitive Illinois Business Interruption Grant Program (BIG) is available for small businesses in Illinois. The program will provide $220 million in funds for small businesses hit hardest by the ongoing pandemic. It is my hope that great businesses in Illinois’s 10th District across Lake and Cook Counties will capitalize on these grants. Applications are open. If you run a local small business, I encourage you to review and apply for this funding.

IN WASHINGTON, DC 
Congress Back in Session 
The House is back in session this week after the Thanksgiving Holiday.  Key priorities for the final weeks of the 116th Congress include finalizing FY2021 funding before December 11, passing the National Defense Authorization Act, and most urgent, but also possibly most challenging, convincing Senate Majority Leader to agree to a COVID Relief Package.  
Towards that end, I was pleased to be a part of a bipartisan, bicameral group that today put forward a compromise COVID Relief proposal.  It is imperative that we help Americans get through the darkness of winter, when we expect to see an explosion of COVID cases impact every part of our society –  from small businesses, to frontline workers, and health care providers.  The Problem Solvers Caucus, along with a bipartisan group of Senators, have been working to try to chart a path forward that can be supported by both chambers and signed by President Trump.  Included in the proposal are new Paycheck Protection Program funding, state and local assistance, and support for unemployment insurance. 
  
Requesting Tickets to the Inauguration 
The Inauguration of President-Elect Joe Biden and Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris will be historic and an unprecedented undertaking in the midst of the pandemic. Though we do not yet have any details, I trust that the January 20th Inauguration Ceremony will be exceptionally well done with protections in place for the public health. 
The JCCIC typically provides members of Congress with a limited number of viewing area tickets to distribute, most of which are for a standing area near the east end of the National Mall. Because of the coronavirus and changing public health guidance, the inaugural ceremony will likely look different than in years past. Unfortunately, this means we are limited in our ability to answer your questions about the event at this time. 
To request tickets, read the “Additional Information” section on my website and fill out the ""Ticket Request Form.” 
  
AROUND THE DISTRICT
Small Business Saturday 
On Small Business Saturday, I stopped by the Book Bin in Northbrook for my annual purchase of books for Rotary Club of Northbrook’s Operation Santa.  It’s a joy to to help make a few young readers’ Christmas special, and at the same time help a wonderful small business. While there, I also picked up a copy of Morality by Rabbi Jonathan Sacks who sadly passed away last month after a long battle with cancer. 
Our Tenth District is filled with exceptional small businesses that give our communities their character and our neighbors their livelihoods. They need our support to get through this pandemic, so as you do your holiday shopping, I hope that you will support small businesses near you. 

  
Lightscape at Chicago Botanic Garden 
Over the weekend, I also visited Lightscape at Chicago Botanic Garden with my wife Julie and son Adam. During the holiday season, and throughout the year, the Garden is a great place to visit. We are lucky in our area to have so many excellent outdoor opportunities to participate in. 

  
Open Enrollment Is Now 
We are currently in Open Enrollment – the yearly period when people can enroll in a health insurance plan. The Open Enrollment period runs through December 15th. Whether you are looking to get covered or are already covered, I encourage you to visit healthcare.gov and shop around. During this COVID pandemic, having access to affordable, quality health coverage is more important than ever. Don’t go uncovered. Go to healthcare.gov and find a quality, affordable plan that works for you. 
Those interested in Medicare Open Enrollment can find a useful presentation from SHIP Coordinator Melissa Versch on the Medicare Plan Finder here. 
  

  
  
Brad’s Bookworms 
I am challenging local elementary students to read ten books before December 31st. This year will mark the fourth year of Brad's Bookworms, and I expect this year's groups to read record-levels of books. Those with questions about participating are encouraged to call the Lincolnshire Office at (847) 383-4870 or email Alvaro.Melara@mail.house.gov 
  
IN CLOSING 
Let me wrap with some good news from the week: NextEra, a provider of wind and solar energy, is now more valuable than Exxon, which was once the largest public company on Earth. We will be able to both combat climate change and build back better, but first we will need to commit to it.  
Please continue to stay strong, stay safe and stay healthy.  We still have a long way to go in the fight to beat the pandemic and regain a sense of normalcy. But, as I talk every day with constituents, elected leaders, small business operators, nonprofit volunteers, and the like, I am constantly reminded of the strength or our communities and the humanity of our neighbors.  I know that together, united as one large community, one strong nation, we will get through this and see better days ahead. 
  
Stay hopeful, be inspired, and please, let’s work together keep each other healthy! 
Sincerely,   Bradley S. Schneider Member of Congress

Dear Friend,

Nearly a month after Joe Biden promised unity, the division in our country has only grown deeper thanks to the partisan actions of Washington Democrats. They are bending the rules to push a massive bailout package through Congress while at the same time trying to impeach a President who has already left office.

So far this impeachment trial has played out like a re-run of a bad sitcom. The plot is known, the outcome is guaranteed, and the emotions are forced with bad acting...KEEP READING HERE

WHAT'S GREAT IN THE 8TH 




Missouri now has an online portal, the COVID-19 Vaccine Navigator, to help residents find vaccination locations and schedule an appointment. You can also find eligibility requirements, cost descriptions, and data about the vaccine.



Chef Kelcie Miller has had culinary adventures around the world but, luckily for us, brought back her wealth of knowledge and talent home to Cape Girardeau. Her newly opened La Relance Cuisine is a labor of love that offers catering, meal prep services, and cooking classes for the community.



The Love Out Loud youth group in Irondale worked for many hours on homemade chocolate covered strawberries for their most recent fundraiser. The proceeds from this fundraiser will go to benefit local veterans, a gift from our thoughtful youth to our treasured patriots.



The Cape Girardeau County Sheriff's Office is helping deliver prescription medications for senior citizens who cannot retrieve their own during these harsh winter weather conditions. Thank you to every officer participating in this program and dedicating their time to ensuring the well-being of our friends and neighbors.



Students who participated in Wyman’s Teen Outreach Program (TOP) at Central Middle School delivered their hand-made toys and treats for animals in local animal shelters. Throughout the school year, students in TOP complete 20+ hours of volunteer community service on projects of their choice and design.



 IN CASE YOU MISSED IT



This week I joined Julie Mason on SiriusXM's POTUS radio channel to discuss my opposition to Biden's bail-out bill. Only 9% of the $1.9 trillion dollars would be used to stop the COVID-19 virus while the other trillions reward Biden's friends: failing blue states and big tech.



I led 66 of my colleagues in writing Joe Biden's White House to tell them to follow science and open schools nationwide. There is little evidence to show in-person instruction in classrooms contributes to the spread of COVID-19. Our children are suffering, and it is time to allow them to resume their education with in-person lessons.



I had the pleasure of joining Carrie Sheffield on Just the News to discuss Washington Democrats proving they are ""all hat and no cattle"" with their circus of an impeachment trial. Their continued refusal to work with their colleagues across the aisle to serve the American people is a disservice to those who voted for action rather than tantrums.



This week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce chose to endorse Biden's Office of Management and Budget director nominee, Neera Tanden, who has spent her entire career taking big business money while pushing policies that destroy small business jobs. By endorsing Tanden, the Chamber is proving it cares more about protecting multinational, Wall Street-backed corporations than Main Street businesses.



I offered two bipartisan amendments to the nearly $2 trillion ""stimulus"" package to make sure the money is used to benefit those who need it most. One would help families who have struggled to afford the costs of remote learning by allowing them to use their 529 savings accounts to buy books, tutoring expenses, and educational therapy for students with disabilities. The second would make the Child Tax Credit, that I voted to double in 2017, permanent for American families. Pelosi's Democrats rejected these improvements and 200 others which would have actually helped American families and instead Washington Dems are prioritizing spending Missourians tax dollars on bailouts for states that continue to enact lock downs, small business and school closures.

PREPARING FOR INAUGURATION 
Our nation is currently preparing for the peaceful transition of power that will occur on January 20 during the Inauguration of the new President and Vice President of the United States. The swearing-in ceremony is an essential tradition in American democracy and its historical significance cannot be overstated. To read more about the 59th Inaugural ceremony and its history, click here. 
 HONORING MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.'S LEGACY 
This upcoming week, we will honor the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. The Reverend was a fearless leader in the civil rights movement, and his work still inspires new generations of leaders. During this time, I encourage all of us to read his powerful “I Have a Dream” address that captivated the nation nearly sixty years ago. A portion of the historic address is included below: 
I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.   I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.”   I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.   I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.   I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today.   I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of “interposition” and “nullification”, one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today.   I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together.

2/14/21 14:01,An Update from Congressman David Kustoff,"Dear Friends,

President Joe Biden's decision to stop construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline is disastrous for American workers and puts our energy security at risk. That is why this week, I signed on to a bill to reverse President Biden’s decision and fight to protect American jobs. I also joined over 100 of my colleagues in sending a letter to President Joe Biden opposing his Executive Order banning oil and gas leasing on federal lands. This policy must be reversed as it will destroy American jobs and severely hurt our economy.



I met with Craig Laman and Mark Davis of Harber Laman Management in Alamo this week. I enjoyed hearing from you both about the state of business during COVID-19. Thank you for meeting with me.



I stopped by Cavalier Pharmacy in Crockett County to meet with Dr. Derek Holyfield. We discussed the importance of locally owned and operated pharmacies as well as COVID-19 vaccine distribution and effectiveness in rural communities. Thank you for taking time to meet with me.



On Tuesday, I met with Dyer County Mayor Chris Young and former Alderman Bob Kirk. We discussed the state of business in Dyer County during COVID-19 and how we can continue to work together to create more economic opportunity in West Tennessee.



I meet with John Ford at Ford Construction Company about the importance of the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses and their employees and harmful federal regulations. I enjoyed sitting down with you!



This Friday, we celebrated the birthday of one of the greatest presidents in American history, President Abraham Lincoln. At a time when our country was deeply divided, President Lincoln ensured our Union remained intact. May his legacy live on forever.

Dear Friend, 
Whether you subscribed to my newsletter back in 2013 when I started or during the start of the pandemic when we began sending out weekly newsletters, thank you so much for reading my newsletter. Thank you for caring about what I have had to say about information from Washington, D.C. and information from around the district. Many of you have shared these newsletters with your friends, family, and on social media, and I thank you for that. 
Although my time in office officially ends on January 2, 2021, due to a very busy next couple of weeks with upcoming votes in Washington, D.C. and Christmas, I thought I would bring you my final newsletter today. 
Last week, I delivered a farewell address to Congress and to the Fifth District reflecting on my eight years serving as your representative. It has been the highest honor of my life to serve as your voice and advocate in our Nation’s Capital. 
Sometime before the holidays, I hope you take 20 minutes with a cup coffee or glass of wine to sit back and enjoy my farewell address, but in case you don’t, here is a short summary of the address. I outlined in detail four steps that I believe can and will go a long way to restoring confidence in Congress, which is important to our democracy. 
The four steps, in short, are as follows; First, we must simply do the work. Every Member of Congress knows making an idea into an effective law takes careful planning. With all of the division in this country, it is easy to point out the problems we face, but it is difficult, humbling work to set aside our differences and focus on finding solutions. 
Second, members must remain closely connected to our home states and the communities and people we represent, now more than ever before. The laws Congress passes are focused on the national level, but my first priority has always been serving the people of the Fifth District to the best of my ability. Members must prioritize their districts. 
The third step is to take a hard look at ourselves in the mirror. We need to ensure Congress truly embodies the diversity that makes our nation strong, and to commit ourselves to a culture of continuous improvement and inclusion. 
The final step to rebuild trust and faith in Congress is to actively look ahead – beyond the most pressing challenge of today – to those challenges on the horizon. Our world is changing fast, and Congress must keep up. 
Furthermore, I discussed what I believe were my most important legislative accomplishments, including the efforts I undertook as part of the various House committees and caucuses I served on or led. 
  

Click here to watch me deliver my final remarks. 
  
Thank you to my beloved friends and family. You have kept me grounded in purpose and direction, helping me to be honest and strong. Your unwavering support and love have made the hard days easier, and the happy days more joyful. David, Jessica and Conner – having you by my side every step of the way has made the journey so rewarding. 
Any accomplishment, whether legislative or back at home, would not be possible without my dedicated team, past and present. They have given their time and talents and have worked tirelessly on behalf of IN05. 
I thanked all Members of Congress, especially the Indiana delegation, many of whom I now call dear friends for their collaboration, intelligence, patriotism and service. It's been a privilege to work with each of them, and I’m grateful for all the opportunities we had to tackle our country's problems. 
Finally, thank you to the people of the Fifth District. As I said in my remarks on the House floor, it has been the great honor of my life to serve as your voice in Congress and your advocate for the last eight years. I’d like to especially recognize the young people who participated in my Youth Advisory Group and the thousands of constituents who visited with me at a Connect with Your Congresswoman events over the years. I'd also like to thank all of the educators and business leaders who made our Connecting Careers and Classrooms events so successful. You make me proud to be a Hoosier. 
In my remarks, I discuss the reauthorization of a bill I co-authored – the Pandemic All-Hazards Preparedness Act – which was signed into law in 2019. This legislation represents years of bipartisan collaboration and thoughtful input from medical and public health preparedness and response leaders. It helped bolster our response to natural disasters and to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats to our national security. When it originally was passed, I thought the legislation would mostly address the threats we faced from terrorist organizations, like ISIS, and biochemical warfare. 
Little did I realize that our nation and our world were on the verge of a pandemic that would grind business, travel, and life as we knew it to a halt. While I’m glad we passed PAHPA when we did, I know that we must do better in the future. When the next novel virus or unforeseen biological catastrophe occurs, Americans should expect more from Congress. We can and will learn from our successes and failures over the last nine months, and in the months to come as we begin distributing a COVID-19 vaccine. While we will ultimately return to a normal way of life, we know that some things will never be the same. 
Change must happen in our country to make good on our founding promise that ALL people are created equal and that our rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness are protected. How we do that is a matter of great debate, playing out in our streets, in protests, on social media, around dinner tables and in headlines. It’s up to every American to forge a path together and to mend the fissures that are breaking apart our nation and our democracy. I have spent the last eight years engaged in this work, day in and day out. It is work I will continue to do for the rest of my life, because, the truth is, we have far more in common than we don’t. I believe in the American spirit and in the power of our ingenuity and the strength of our resolve. 
We will get through these difficult days. This pandemic will end. We will get Americans and businesses back to work. We will overcome the scourge of racism and prejudice. We will restore trust and confidence in our government and in Congress. We will once again see Congress full of big ideas aimed at ensuring the American Dream is within reach for everyone. 
Thank you, IN05 for allowing me to have the honor of representing you in our Nation’s Capital. 
For those who celebrate Hannukah, Chag Sameach! For those celebrating Christmas, Merry Christmas and happy holidays from the Brooks family! 
With gratitude,

Rioters Breaching The U.S. Capitol Building
I would like to begin by expressing the outrage I have felt this past week, along with so many Americans, as rioters stormed the Capitol Building, breached the Capitol Complex, and laid siege to the Capitol for many hours in an attempt to prevent the certification of the Electoral College vote in the presidential election. This insurrection left at least 5 people dead and numerous people injured, not to mention creating horrendous property destruction. During this chaos, I was forced to evacuate my office along with colleagues from both parties but was thankfully able to shelter in place in another section of the Capitol until the police and National Guard had secured the Capitol grounds. That same night, once the Capitol was secured, my colleagues and I finished the business of certifying the Electoral College vote around 4 A.M. in the morning in a determined show of democracy triumphing over mob rule.
I am determined and resolute in holding those who perpetrated this assault on our democracy accountable. We must never let this happen again as we will never give in to violence, mob rule, or sedition. I intend to work with people on both sides of the aisle to come together to move our country forward, and I will always fight for and defend the Constitution and democracy at all costs. The rioters will never prevail.  
Swearing-In of the 117th Congress
After Wednesday’s chaos, it’s hard to believe that just on Sunday I was honored to be sworn in as a member of the 117th Congress. This Congress is the most diverse in history and reflects the strength our country has to offer, regardless of party, as we combat the challenges of this pandemic. I take great pride in my role as your representative and vow to continue my work to improve the lives of everyone in our community.
 

I captured a photo of myself at the socially distanced quorum call of the 117th Congress on Sunday 
Update on COVID-19 Case Rates and Vaccine Distribution
In Illinois, the COVID-19 case positivity rate has increased by 1.2% over the last week to reach an average of 8.6% this week. While our positivity rate was trending downward in late December, it has unfortunately increased which makes the effective distribution of coronavirus vaccines all the more important. As that process continues, we must continue to follow public health measures and expert guidance, including mask-wearing and practicing social distancing.
So far, the Chicago area has administered more than 34,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. The first group to receive the vaccine are healthcare workers and long-term care facility residents. I am concerned by the lack of federal coordination and communication regarding the distribution of the vaccine, especially given reports that many Chicago-area health systems don’t know when to expect more vaccine shipments. That’s why I’m already working in Congress to ensure that this process is executed carefully and efficiently to accelerate inoculation rates while ensuring vaccine doses don’t expire or go to waste.
8th District Photography Contest
I’d like to invite you to participate in my district-wide landscape photography competition. We are lucky to be surrounded by so much beauty and nature in the 8th District of Illinois. I want to see what landscape images our local photographers can capture. To participate, please email your landscape photos of our district by January 31st to KrishnamoorthiPhotoContest@gmail.com with the photographer’s name, zip code, and the Illinois' 8th District location of the photograph. Please submit photos in their highest resolution and be advised that my office may use it. The winning photo will be announced via social media in early February. For more information click here.

5/5/21 18:02,CBC VACCINATION WEEK GOTV – Get Out The Vaccine tour,"Dear Friends, 
 
I know I just wrote yesterday, but I want you to be aware of a multi-event vaccination tour I’m taking in the district over the next several days. COVID-19 has hit our community particularly hard, so I’m doing everything I can to raise awareness to make sure everyone gets vaccinated, particularly young people who feel like their young and healthy so they don’t need to get the vaccine. 
 
But they do. Unfortunately, young people are not immune from getting very sick or hospitalized from COVID-19, and could suffer long-term consequences. Watch this video from Emory Hospital. It’s so important that we all get vaccinated, not just us older folks.  
 
As part of an effort with the Congressional Black Caucus, local health departments, county commissioners, local hospitals and churches, I'm highlighting the need for my constituents – especially young people – to get vaccinated during our #cbcvaccinationweek GOTV – Get Out The Vaccine tour May 1-8 – that includes events with DeKalb County Commissioners Mereda Davis Johnson (District 5) and Larry Johnson (District 3) at the Lou Walker Senior Center; the Gwinnett, Rockdale and Newton Health Department at Springfield Baptist Church in Conyers; the DeKalb Board of Health at Berean Baptist Church in Stone Mountain and Emory Hillandale Hospital in south DeKalb. 
 
Please come out if you have not received your vaccine, and send this information to young family members and fiends who have not yet received their vaccine. You can sign up conveniently below at a location that works for you.

December 24, 2020 

Dear Friends, 

I wanted to send you an update on the recent spending package (H.R. 133) that passed the House and Senate.

As you may know, H.R. 133 included all 12 appropriations bills for 2021 in addition to $900 billion in much-needed relief from the coronavirus pandemic. 

The American people are in desperate need of immediate relief from this crisis. This $900 billion coronavirus relief package contains critical rescues for Americans across the country. While it is certainly a start, please rest assured I will continue to fight for expanded relief measures as we move into the new year and the new Congress. Specifically, the bill includes:
	•	Direct payments of $600 to eligible adults and an additional $600 per qualifying child – for example, a qualifying family of four would receive $2,400;   
	•	$25.4 billion for the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund for testing, tracing, and treatment to stop the spread of the coronavirus in addition to $8.75 billion to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to support vaccination efforts;   
	•	$2 billion to maintain paid leave in addition to extended unemployment provisions, including $300 weekly for all workers receiving unemployment benefits;   
	•	$284 billion for first and second Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans to small businesses; expanded eligibility and critical improvements to the PPP; a dedicated $15 billion for live venues and cultural institutions; and $20 billion for targeted Emergency Injury Disaster Loan grants;   
	•	$25 billion in rental assistance and an extension of the eviction moratorium;   
	•	$13 billion in emergency food assistance, including a temporary boost to the monthly food stamp benefit;   
	•	And, finally, an additional $10 billion for childcare to help families and our economy get back on track.
For more information on the coronavirus relief portion of the bill, please see here.

The bill also includes critical investments for 2021 from the Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, which I chair. These provisions support our nation’s programs that will be critical to recovering from this pandemic and helping working families thrive. From Early Head Start to Social Security to CDC and NIH, they touch individuals and families throughout their lives. For more information on this portion of the bill, please see here.

This package is a critical first step forward that will help ameliorate the damage of the virus, but it is just that—a step. You can be sure that when we return in 2021, we will resume these negotiations and work with the Biden-Harris Administration to fill in the gaps of this package so the American people can rebuild and recover from this historic crisis.

During this holiday season, please remember to follow public health guidelines – we must stay the course. For guidelines from the State of Connecticut, please see here. For information from the CDC, please see here. 

Stay safe and be well, 


Rosa DeLauro

For Immediate Release
December 11, 2020


REPRESENTATIVE ADRIANO ESPAILLAT INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO HELP PROVIDERS RECEIVE, STORE, AND DELIVER mRNA COVID-19 VACCINES

The COVID-19 Cold Storage Expansion Act of 2020 Allows Providers to be Reimbursed for Costs of New Storage Equipment to Meet CDC Recommendations


WASHINGTON, DC – Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) released the following statement with the introduction of his legislation, the COVID-19 Cold Storage Expansion Act of 2020: 

“With the planned meeting this week and next week by the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee reviewing the safety and efficacy of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidates, we need to make sure that all willing providers are able to receive, store, and deliver these COVID-19 vaccines if approved,” said Rep. Adriano Espaillat (NY-13). “The COVID-19 Cold Storage would allow providers who complete and sign the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) COVID–19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement to be reimbursed for the costs of purchasing new equipment that would meet the specific standards as recommended by the CDC. 

“Allowing more providers to be registered in their city, state, and region to receive and administer these mRNA vaccines will be a critical part of the wider vaccination campaign that must occur to successfully combat this COVID-19 virus,” Espaillat continued. “While the priority in the near term will be vaccination of frontline health care workers, elderly residents of nursing homes and long-term care facilities and essential workers, this legislation will benefit all cities and regions as the wider vaccination campaigns begin in 2020 and continue into 2021.”

CONGRESISTA ADRIANO ESPAILLAT INTRODUCE LEGISLACIÓN PARA AYUDAR A LOS PROVEEDORES A RECIBIR, ALMACENAR Y ENTREGAR VACUNAS mRNA CONTRA EL COVID-19

La Ley de Expansión de Almacenamiento en Frío COVID-19 de 2020 permite que los proveedores sean reembolsados por los costos de nuevos equipos de almacenamiento para cumplir con las recomendaciones de los CDC


WASHINGTON, DC – El congresista Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) emitió la siguiente declaración sobre la introducción de su legislación, Ley de Expansión de Almacenamiento en Frío COVID-19 de 2020:

“Con la reunión planificada para esta semana y la próxima por el Comité Asesor de Vacunas y Productos Biológicos Relacionados que revisa la seguridad y eficacia de los candidatos a suministrar vacunas mRNA contra el COVID-19 Pfizer/BioNTech y Moderna, debemos asegurarnos de que todos los proveedores dispuestos puedan recibir, almacenar y entregar estas vacunas contra el COVID-19 si se aprueban”, dijo el Rep. Adriano Espaillat (NY-13). “La Ley de Almacenamiento en Frío de la vacuna contra el COVID-19 permitiría a los proveedores que completen y firmen el Acuerdo de Proveedores del Programa de Vacunación contra el COVID-19 de los Centros para el Control de Enfermedades (CDC) recibir un reembolso por los costos de compra de equipos nuevos que cumplan con los estándares específicos recomendados por los CDC.

“Permitir que más proveedores se registren en su ciudad, estado y región para recibir y administrar estas vacunas mRNA será una parte fundamental de la campaña de vacunación más amplia que debe ocurrir para combatir con éxito este virus COVID-19”, continuó Espaillat. “Si bien la prioridad a corto plazo será la vacunación de los trabajadores de atención médica de primera línea, los ancianos residentes de hogares de ancianos e instalaciones de atención a largo plazo y los trabajadores esenciales, esta legislación beneficiará a todas las ciudades y regiones a medida que las campañas de vacunación más amplias comiencen en 2020 y continúen en 2021"".

12/19/20 8:33,Vaccines Save Lives,"December 19, 2020 
Dear Fellow Marylander: 
This week, media headlines brought incredible news that vaccines for COVID-19 have been approved and are ready for distribution. In fact, the first Americans, mostly frontline health care workers, received the first dose of a two-part vaccine. We have reached this point in record time through the collaboration of dedicated scientists and federal investments in research and supplies. My immense thanks go out to all those who worked around the clock on the development of these vaccines, especially those in the Bethesda-based National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
Getting vaccinated is a key piece in our fight against this deadly COVID-19 virus that has infected more than 17 million Americans and tragically cost the lives of more than 311,000 Americans. The numbers will continue to rise until we can get the community spread under control. 
I have said it before, but cannot say this enough: wearing a mask, maintaining six feet of space from people not in your household, and frequent hand washing are critical public health tools. If more Americans had followed these simple recommendations, we may have saved hundreds of thousands of lives. But we have to deal with where we are today and these newly approved vaccines will play a critical role in preventing further spread in our communities.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “a vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce antibodies, exactly like it would if you were exposed to the disease. After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first.""
Without a vaccine, our children’s schools may not be able to safely reopen; businesses, and especially restaurants and event venues, would continue to hemorrhage customers and money; our hospital systems would continue to be overwhelmed with patients as more individuals are infected with COVID-19. A vaccine helps Americans achieve herd immunity by protecting people from a virus, rather than exposing them to it. With herd immunity, the vast majority of the population are vaccinated, lowering the amount of virus spread in the whole population. 
Vaccines help us reach a higher level of immunity by preventing diseases from taking root. 
Two versions of a COVID-19 vaccine have been approved for the current emergency use. One is by Pfizer and one by drugmaker Moderna. Others are also nearing the approval stage. While pharmaceutical companies are working to increase available supplies, at present there are not enough doses of the vaccines to provide to every person in this country or around the world. It has been a mammoth undertaking. 
To that end, most of the first wave of vaccines will be prioritized for frontline health care workers and nursing home residents and staff, for which this pandemic has been most deadly. In addition to seniors, essential workers and those with underlying health conditions and at high risk for complications from COVID-19 could be next in line and then the distribution will move to the general public.
I would strongly encourage everyone to talk with their doctor to gauge their risk and then get vaccinated as soon as a dose is available to you. Like wearing a facemask, getting a vaccine is something we do to keep ourselves safe. But – more importantly – it is something we do to keep safe those we love as well as those in our community we don’t know but may be at high risk. We all need to look out for each other. Only as a community can we fight back against this deadly virus.
I plan to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it is available to me. While I am healthy, like everyone in my age group, I need to be careful. I maximize the use of technology to keep up virtual visits with Marylanders across the state throughout this year, but my job inherently requires me to trek through the Capitol on a near-daily basis. Without fail, I wind up standing a bit closer than I would like with other senators, staff, security and media, many of whom have traveled from all 50 states to be there for our collective work. Certainly, there are smaller crowds than usual these last few months during the pandemic, but there are enough interactions that I cannot ask everyone who stops to ask me a question in the hallways, or even on the floor of the Senate, when they last washed their hands or if their face mask is on correctly. Like you, the last thing that I would want to do is unknowingly bring home the virus to my family.
Last week, I led a meeting of the Maryland delegation with Maryland Acting Health Secretary Dennis Schrader and Acting Deputy Secretary of Public Health Dr. Jinlene Chan. The pair outlined steps MDH has taken to prepare Maryland for the first round of vaccine distribution. All of us on the video call urged them to move as quickly as possible and to focus on communities disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, as well as geography. We cannot allow those hardest hit by the virus to fall through the cracks at this critical moment of relief.
Yesterday, Vice President Pence publicly received his coronavirus vaccine, as did House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. President-elect Biden plans to receive his vaccine publicly next week, and former Presidents Obama, Bush, and Clinton have committed to publicly receiving the vaccine. I trust the scientists who approved these vaccines, and so do our national leaders. This is not a miracle-cure that will end the pandemic, but it is one of the most critical tools in our arsenal to get our society back to normal. If you have questions about the vaccine, please review public health resources like the MDH guide to the vaccine here: https://covidlink.maryland.gov/content/vaccine/. 
Lastly, having a vaccine is not the end of this public health crisis. The number of individuals vaccinated will start small and continue to grow. It may be March or April until lower risk individuals have a chance to get vaccinated. The vaccines have proven safe, but more time and additional studies must take place for us to better understand the long-term health protections afforded by the vaccine. We also do not know if the vaccines prevent vaccinated people from spreading the virus – this means, even after someone is vaccinated, they must still be vigilant with their mask use and other public health measures.  
I urge you to please be cautious this holiday season so that you and those you love are healthy enough to celebrate next year.
Thank you for your efforts and stay safe.

During the previous district work week in Congress, I hit the road to visit parts of Central and Southern Oregon. I spent time honoring our nation's veterans; listening to community, tribal, and business leaders; engaging with the media; and meeting with the Federal Emergency Management Agency regarding recovery efforts following the Almeda Fire in Jackson County.


Deschutes County


On Monday, I spoke at the National Vietnam War Veterans Day event at the Central Oregon Veterans Ranch. This day is dedicated to honoring American troops who served in South Vietnam and to upholding our responsibility as a nation to thank and honor all those who fought for the cause of freedom. Many thanks to all those who made the event a success.


I was proud to recognize Kristin Gyford of Bend, OR on being the only Oregonian named a 2021 Women Veteran Trailblazer by the US Department of Veterans Affairs. She is one of only 27 women across the United States to be named a Women Veteran Trailblazer this year. 

Kristin is a U.S. Air Force veteran and founder of Still Serving Counseling and Services in Bend, which focuses on helping veterans, first responders, and their families. I was pleased to present her with a certificate and an American flag in honor of her achievement. 


I met with the Central Oregon Irrigation District in Redmond, OR on Monday. They presented me with a gold shovel from the Pilot Butte Piping Project. Projects like this are essential if we are to conserve our resources, provide water for irrigation systems, and meet environmental demands.


On Tuesday, I had the pleasure of meeting with the Sisters Chamber of Commerce. We discussed issues impacting businesses in the community such as COVID-19 recovery, finding people to work, housing, transportation, and the success of community events. 


I also had the pleasure of touring BasX Solutions, which is headquartered in Redmond, OR. We discussed issues impacting their industry and the challenges many employers are facing with workforce shortages.


Crook County


On Tuesday, I visited the Crook County Vaccination Clinic at the Crook County Fairgrounds. During my visit, it was said that they administered 650 vaccines that day. Vaccinations are essential if we are to end this pandemic and reopen our economy. Many thanks to healthcare workers, essential personnel, and all the folks working on the frontlines to defeat this virus. 

I have been vaccinated for COVID-19, and I encourage those who are eligible (and able) to be vaccinated to please do so as soon as possible. 

To learn more about vaccinations, please visit: https://covidvaccine.oregon.gov/.


I visited the Crook County Chamber of Commerce in Prineville, OR. We discussed issues faced by businesses in the area, including difficulties in finding a stable and willing workforce.


On Wednesday, I visited the La Pine Senior Activity Center for a discussion on infrastructure and the growth of the community. Thank you to the officials who met with me to talk about how we can tackle these issues. 


Jackson County




On Wednesday, I met with the professionals at Mercy Flights - a nonprofit air and ground ambulance service. I checked out some of their equipment and toured their facility in Medford, OR. We touched on issues having to do with health care and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. 




On Thursday, I met with federal, state, and local officials regarding the Almeda Fire, which devastated the Medford, Phoenix, and Talent areas last September. We discussed the ongoing FEMA recovery efforts and the concerns of those struggling to get back on their feet. We need coordination at all levels to fully recover and rebuild. 

I have advocated for 100% federal cost share for this unprecedented disaster in my communications with the White House. My office remains committed to connecting those in need with federal resources. I encourage anyone with concerns to contact my office in Medford, OR at 541-776-4646. 



Click to WATCH!

I also visited the studio at KOBI-TV 5 in Medford for a 5 on 5 interview. Click above to watch our discussion covering the Almeda Fire, President Biden's proposal on infrastructure, and other issues. 


On Friday, I traveled to the Flying Eagle Market and Video in Eagle Point, OR where I spoke at a roundtable with workers, retirees, and community leaders regarding a number off issues, including my support for the Second Amendment and issues pertaining to the United States Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. Thanks to all those who participated in and helped set up this event.


Josephine County


On Thursday, I visited the Grants Pass & Josephine County Chamber of Commerce. I met with government, community, and business leaders to discuss the COVID-19 pandemic, reopening efforts, and Paycheck Protection Program loans for businesses - for which the new deadline is May 31, 2021.


Klamath County


On Friday, I traveled to Chiloquin, OR to meet with members of The Klamath Tribes. We discussed the Biden Administration's infrastructure proposal and a recent congressional letter I signed to stop the sale of the National Archives and Records Administration Federal Archives and Records Center in Seattle, Washington. This facility contains irreplaceable records that are critical to the Tribes in the Pacific Northwest. 




I want to thank all of those who took the time and made the effort to meet with me. I learned a lot - as usual! I will put what I learned to good use in Washington, DC.

5/28/21 13:51,Weekly Report From Rep. Anna G. Eshoo,"News from Representative Eshoo 

Friday 28 May 2021  Weekly Report From Your Congresswoman 

Dear friends, 
On Wednesday, tragedy struck our region. A mass shooting claimed nine lives at the VTA in San Jose. My prayers are with the grieving families of the victims, and we’re all grateful for the bravery of the first responders. This was another horrible and deadly reminder that it’s past time for Congress to pass bold legislation to protect our communities from gun violence. The House passed legislation to close background check loopholes and require commonsense safety regulations of gun purchases, but we need the Senate to stop blocking this life-saving legislation. 
If you’re experiencing emotional distress because of this tragedy, you can call the Disaster Distress Helpline to speak with a professional at 1-800-985-5990.

Covid-19 Update 
I’m so pleased to report that over 50% of adults in the United States are now fully vaccinated. If you or your children are eligible and have not received your vaccine yet, please sign up for an appointment at your county’s website below. 
San Mateo County 
Santa Cruz County 
Santa Clara County 
More good Covid-19 news: the FDA authorized another antibody treatment, sotrovimab, for high-risk Covid-19 patients. In a clinical trial, the antibody treatment showed an 85% reduction in the risk of hospitalization or death for people sick with Covid-19, compared with those who received a placebo. It was also shown to be effective against the virus variants first identified from Britain, South Africa, Brazil, California, New York and India. If you test positive for Covid-19, you should speak to your doctor immediately about whether a monoclonal antibody is a good treatment for you. 
Santa Clara County Vaccine Events 
In partnership with the San Jose Earthquakes, Santa Clara County is hosting a vaccine clinic at Overfelt High School today, May 28th until 7:30pm. Those who receive a Covid-19 vaccine will be entered into a raffle to win one of several autographed Earthquakes jerseys. Also, former player, Ramiro Corrales, will be signing autographs for those receiving the vaccine from 4:30 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Anyone age 12 and older can get vaccinated. 
Santa Clara County is also holding an event entitled “Ask the Doctor” on Wednesday, June 2nd from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. At this event, doctors will be available by phone to answer anyone’s questions about the Covid-19 vaccines in English, Spanish, Vietnamese, and Chinese. To ask a question, call (408) 970-2999.  
Legislation Anna Introduced & Cosponsored This Week 
National Museum of Asian Pacific American History and Culture 
Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) history is American history. That’s why I cosponsored legislation to establish a commission composed of eight historians and museum experts to study the feasibility of a National Museum of Asian Pacific American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. AAPI history belongs in the Smithsonian. 
ENCRYPT Act 
Robust encryption is critical for protecting the online privacy and security of all Americans and it is essential for our national security. That’s why I’m proud to partner with Reps. Lieu, Mace, and DelBene on the ENCRYPT Act to ensure state and local laws cannot jeopardize the security of all Americans by weakening encryption. This bill ensures a uniform, national policy for the interstate issue of encryption technology. 
Letters Anna Signed This Week 
I signed a letter this week urging Senate leadership to support David Chipman as Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). Chipman has more than two decades of experience as a law enforcement professional at ATF. If confirmed, he will bring a unique perspective to the agency after having served as an expert advising organizations at the forefront of gun violence prevention. We have a gun violence epidemic in our country and strong leadership at the helm of ATF is critically important. 
Telephone Town Hall 
I apologize for having to cancel our meeting this week due to the mass shooting tragedy. I attended the vigil in San Jose in commemoration of those whose lives were taken. I will hold the Telephone Town Hall Meeting next Thursday and meet with constituents in Atherton, Menlo Park, Portola Valley, and Woodside. You can sign up HERE. 
In the Words of My Constituents 
Every week hundreds of my constituents call and write to me to express their concerns, share their passions, and ask questions regarding legislation and policies. Over 65,138 constituents have contacted me so far this year. I actually read every communication and every constituent receives a personal response to their specific questions and comments from me. This week, 1,510 constituents contacted my office about issues including: 
	•	186 messages in support of ending qualified immunity for police officers  
	•	145 messages in support of the Save Oak Flat Act  
	•	107 messages in support of the Keep It in the Ground Act

Vaccine update. CEO Esther Muna and COO Subroto Banerji briefed me on the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation’s preparation to receive, store, administer, and track distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine due to arrive soon. Even after we are vaccinated, it will still be necessary to wear masks, maintain social distance, and wash frequently to stop the virus spreading. 

Vaccine coming to Marianas

The Marianas is expected to receive an initial shipment of 5,850 doses of a COVID-19 vaccine within days, enough to cover a first-priority group of healthcare workers, first responders, and high-risk patients. A U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel cleared the way this week for an emergency use approval of the new Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine nationwide. The Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation has been working diligently on Rota, Tinian, and Saipan to receive and store the vaccine, which must be kept at ultra-low temperatures, and to track distribution, because two shots are required in a three-week period for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to be fully effective. At a briefing on Thursday, CHCC asked me to take this new medicine to demonstrate to the public trust in its safety. I agreed, as long as everyone in the first-priority group is taken care of. It will be very important that no one in our community hang back from vaccination, if we want to return our lives and economy to normal in 2021. 
 
 

A framework for relief. West Virginia’s Joe Manchin, Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, and other centrist Senators agreed a spending framework for COVID relief this week. Ever since the House passed the HEROES Act in May—and, again, in October—we have been trying to get the Trump administration and the Republican Senate to wake up to the desperate needs of Americans everywhere in the middle of this pandemic. Now, there are signs of progress. 

Prospects for COVID relief

Negotiations continue to add unemployment extension, more school funding, and other COVID relief measures to a final spending bill for this year. The House passed necessary legislation in October; and this week a bipartisan group of Senators put forward a plan (see table, above). As legislative language is drafted, your congressional office is talking with House and Senate negotiators about issues key to the Marianas. This includes getting the Commonwealth financial assistance, so that government services continue and government workers can keep their jobs. Many Republicans are against giving any money to state and territorial governments, however. I am also hopeful that federal unemployment assistance will be extended for at least four months, although the Trump administration keeps trying to cut the amount of assistance that would go to those who lost their jobs. And I believe we are on track to get more money for food aid and education, though there are many details still under discussion. Negotiations could fall through, but at least Republicans are now willing to talk about how to help our country get through this crisis.
 
 

PUA issues aired. On Wednesday, I attended the PUA Town Hall hosted by the Commonwealth Legislature’s minority bloc. The goal of this town hall was to provide a safe and open forum for constituents to share their views and experiences with the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance Program. Watch the video here. 
 

Extend unemployment assistance

The PUA and FPUC programs only cover unemployment that occurs in 2020. And unless Congress passes the next coronavirus aid package currently under negotiation, the PUA program will expire at the end of this month. So, I joined my colleagues Reps. Davis (D-IL) and Kildee (D-MI) in a letter to the President urging support for an extension of the PUA program before its expiration. The current aid package proposes an extension of PUA and FPUC benefits, providing $645 per week to eligible Marianas workers for 16 weeks from January into April 2021.
 

Trump blocks food for island kids

Congress provided the Marianas with asn additional $12-16 million in food aid for families with school-age children through the Pandemic EBT program in the continuing resolution signed into law in October. But the Trump administration is refusing to allow the Marianas and other insular areas to issue retroactive aid to families to cover last school year. So, in my capacity as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, along with Education and Labor Committee Chairman Bobby Scott, I wrote the U.S. Department of Agriculture requesting they reverse its unconscionable decision to block food assistance funding. Children in the Marianas, like their counterparts nationwide, must not lose access to meals because the coronavirus has closed their schools. 
 
 

Brothers win App Challenge. Justin Du, Jie Du, Carson Lin, and James Lin of Marianas High School are the winners of this year’s NMI Congressional App Challenge with their app, “SRC.” SRC is a web-based customer relationship management system for businesses. The four sophomores will receive national recognition and have their app eligible for display at the U.S. Capitol. Congratulations! 
 

Faster internet for the Marianas

DoCoMo Pacific, Inc. will receive $3,806,235 over ten years to bring reliable, reasonably priced, broadband service to designated areas on Saipan, Tinian, and Rota—good news for residents without high-speed internet access. DoCoMo is one of 180 winning bidders of the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Phase I auction, the Federal Communications Commission announced Monday. Funding terms require DoCoMo to offer broadband services to 80 percent of the coverage area by the end of the fifth year. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of high speed internet access for distance learning, telehealth, and business activities, as social distancing requirements have forced a shift in-person to on-line. Congratulations to DoCoMo. 
 

Army Corps’ insular waiver increased

Cost-share waivers for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects in the Marianas will keep pace with inflation under a provision in the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 2020, which passed the House Tuesday by unanimous consent. The original Marianas waiver was set in 1986 at $200,000, but I was able to increase that to $455,000 in WRDA 2014, arguing the waiver needed to account for inflation. The inflation adjustment was renewed in WRDA 2018 bringing the waiver to $484,000. Now, WRDA 2020 mandates an annual adjustment, so the Marianas, other insular areas, and Native American Tribes would get an adjusted waiver of the local cost-share amount every year. WRDA authorizes the Army Corps to carry out water resources development projects and studies, and provides policy direction for the Corps’ civil works missions including navigation, flood and storm damage reduction, shoreline protection, and ecosystem restoration. WRDA 2020 now heads to the Senate for a final vote before going to the President’s desk to be signed into law. 
 

Defense Act with NMI bills to President

Legislation including the Marianas in additional federal programs and $61 million for Air Force projects on Tinian was passed by Congress and sent to the President on Friday. The provisions were included in H.R. 6395, the $732 billion FY21 National Defense Authorization Act, which also raises servicemember pay, enhances military readiness, capabilities, and prioritizes technological security. The bills I authored and added to the Act will help military spouses pay for career education and provide new grant funds to help small businesses, students excel in STEM, and law enforcement keep children safe in the Marianas. Read more on these highlights here. 
 
 

Work for Veterans continues. On Wednesday, the House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Disability and Memorial Affairs held a hearing to examine the VA’s process for creating presumptions of service connection, the effectiveness of the process, and the impact on disability claims.  Key concerns include the high denial rates for burn pit exposure claims and problems with Gulf War Illness claims. The testimony from the U.S. Government Accountability Office on VA’s challenges in processing GWI claims is informative and may be of interest to Marianas veterans. 
 

Vets cemetery grant boost moves                      

The Senate amended and unanimously approved H.R. 7105, an omnibus package including my bill, H.R. 5487, increasing federal maintenance funds available for the Marpi veterans cemetery and others nationwide. With more veterans choosing burial near home, more state, territorial, and tribal governments in charge of cemeteries are faced with increased operations and maintenance costs. H.R. 5487, the Veterans Cemetery Grants Improvement Act, doubles the current grant limit of $5 million for these purposes. The funding helps address the challenges the Commonwealth faces in preventing the defacing of our veterans’ final resting places. H.R. 7105 now goes to the House for consideration.

5/17/21 14:31,April Recap,"Dear neighbor, 

Happy Monday and Eid Mubarak to all of our Musilm neighbors! Wishing those who celebrated a peaceful Eid al-Fitr as the new moon appears. May this Eid al-Fitr serve as time to reflect on the sacrifices of the fast, and the sacrifices over the past year to keep yourself, your family, and community safe. For all of NY-16 I hope all is well with you, your family and loved ones. Today I am happy to provide you with an update on some of the business our office conducted throughout the month of April. 

Last month, we had the opportunity to spend time in the district meeting with neighbors and other elected officials to bring federal resources where they are most needed in NY-16. We hosted a town hall at Yonkers YWCA to discuss our eventful first 100 days in Congress and I met with seniors (pictured to the right) while visiting the New Rochelle Housing Authority.
I also toured the Gun Hill Houses and Anne’s Place, a shelter run by Project Renewal. A huge honor was having Rye High School Freshman Maddy Rye join me virtually for Biden’s Address to Congress as my guest. Maddy has been working with her peers to register seniors for COVID-19 vaccines. Pictured below are COVID Angels from Rye High School who also helped seniors register for a COVID-19 vaccine. I look forward to seeing them all grow in the district.
 
 

One of our proudest accomplishments in April was submitting 10 Community Project Funding requests to the House Appropriations Committee, along with more than 200 other programmatic and language requests to bring federal funds to our communities in FY22. I also submitted 7 requests for transportation and pedestrian safety improvements in our district as part of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee’s Member Designated Projects. We’ll be working hard to get these requests approved to bring home support for essential services and programs in the district. Every single person in our district deserves access to equitable, modern, and fully-funded services.    Please continue reading for more updates on our work in the district and our legislative agenda. As always, do not hesitate to reach out to one of my offices for any questions and/or concerns. Contact information for each office can be found below.

Legislative Update   In April, I voted for the following bills below which passed in the U.S. House of Representatives in order to advance issues like equitable legal representation, pay equity, and preventing discrimination against individuals seeking refuge in the United States.  
	•	H.R. 7 - Paycheck Fairness Act
	•	H.R. 1195 - Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act
	•	H.R. 1333 - No BAN Act 
	•	H.R.1573 - Access to Counsel Act of 2021
	•	H.R.51 - Washington, D.C. Admission Act

Additionally, in April I sent a letter to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris urging them to make historic and much-needed expansions and improvements to the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program through the American Families Plan. Many individuals rely on SSI benefits to survive, but are still subjected to living in poverty due to the limitations on benefits the program imposes. 

I also sent a letter with Representative Espaillat to President Biden and administration officials urging for an ambitious and equitable commitment from the United States in efforts to address the climate crisis domestically and internationally. As the richest country in the world, and the nation most responsible for carbon emissions since the industrial revolution, the United States has a unique and profound responsibility to lead the global energy transition

In the wake of the Derek Chauvin conviction, I wrote a letter to President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting the DOJ reopen its investigation into the death of Tamir Rice. Derek Chauvin’s conviction was one step toward basic accountability and I am calling on the Biden administration to do more.

Lastly, I led three letters to the House Appropriations Committee to advocate for increased broadband access for HUD-assisted households, increased oversight of charter schools, and additional financial support for teachers and school leadership in public schools. I am grateful to the over 50 colleagues who joined me in advocating for these causes.

In addition to votes in the House and writing the aforementioned letters, I also supported over 70 of my colleagues’ bills,resolutions, and letters. Below I highlight some of these legislative efforts:

	•	Tax Excessive CEO Pay Act
	•	Black Maternal Health Week Resolution
	•	SACKLER Act
	•	H.R.1783 - Accessible, Affordable Internet for All Act
	•	Public Housing Fire Safety Act
	•	Universal Child Care and Early Learning Act
	•	HEAL for Immigrant Families Act
	•	FY22 Letter Supporting Global Nutrition Programs
	•	Letter to private health insurers about waiving cost sharing for COVID-19 treatment
	•	Letter to President Biden to lift the refugee admissions cap
	•	Letter to support our nation’s food banks
	•	Letter to create a fund for global health and pandemic preparedness
District Office Update   In April, my office saw a major uptick in casework. We currently have 475 open cases, of which about 40 are closed per week. By far, immigration cases are most prominent in our district, given that about a third of our district is foreign born. These cases also take the longest to complete. Our response rate to constituents who need assistance with a federal agency or other department is currently around 72 hours. We are steadily working to resolve your needs!   Last month, I joined Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer in Co-op City to call on President Biden and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to green light refinancing on a $500 million loan for the Co-op City in the Bronx for essential renovating and repairs to Co-op City — improvements that are urgently needed to ensure the health and safety of residents, many of whom are seniors. 

 My office also wrapped up the Congressional Art Competition for high school students. On May 1, we hosted a virtual reception to announce the winners, who were provided scholarships from generous constituents. The first place piece will hang in the U.S. Capitol with other submissions from throughout the country for an entire year. To view all the submissions and winning pieces, click here.  
For all other concerns please feel free to reach out to my office. We are able to assist with the following services:  
	•	Get a flag flown over the Capitol
	•	Get nominated to a U.S. Military Service Academy
	•	Get information on grants
	•	Request a letter of support 
	•	Request a program letter
	•	Request a certificate or proclamation
	•	Receive help with a federal agency including the Social Security Administration, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the IRS or any other federal agency.
In everything I do I also want to take the time to honor constituents who deserve to be celebrated and appreciated. If you or someone you know would like to be featured by my office for the work you do or for a special accomplishment please share at this link! 
Peace and love,

12/24/20 10:02,Happy Holidays & An End-of-Year Report To Constituents,"Dear Friends, 
 
To say 2020 has been a challenging year is an understatement. Many of us have lost loved ones and all of us have faced hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic during this difficult and trying year. 
 
The good news is vaccines are now being administered to frontline and healthcare workers – and will soon be available to senior citizens and people with underlying conditions. By the spring and summer, younger and healthier people should be able to get vaccinated as well. 
 
There’s a lot of misinformation out there, but the vaccine is safe and effective. I want everyone who can get vaccinated to get one as soon as possible – not only to protect yourself, but your parents and grandparents and any loved ones in your life who are vulnerable. 
 
I’m pleased to report that under the end-of-year Coronavirus Relief & Omnibus Agreement, Congress approved legislation to provide funds to speed vaccine distribution, continue help for small businesses and minority lending institutions, enhance unemployment insurance, provide direct payments and extend rental assistance. 
 
Whether the president signs the bill into law remains up the air. One thing for certain is that I, along with my Democrat colleagues in the House, will continue to fight to increase stimulus checks to $2,000. We tried this morning, but our friends on the other side of the aisle blocked us. On Monday, we’ll try again by holding a vote on our stand-alone bill to increase economic impact payments to $2,000. 
 
There’s light at the end of the tunnel. Please continue to wear your masks, socially distance and wash your hands regularly – even if you have been vaccinated. Doing so will save tens of thousands of lives. Now is the time to redouble our efforts to curb the spread – for ourselves, our families and our communities. Together, we shall overcome this virus and all that 2020 has thrown at us. 
 
On that note, here is a report on what I and my staff accomplished in the 116th Congress (2019-2020). It helps us look back to see what we did right, but also is a roadmap on how we can do things better moving forward.  
 
As always, I appreciate your time and feedback. Please remember you can reach me and get updates on what’s happening in Washington and GA-04 on my Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages by clicking the icons at the top of this e-letter. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to represent you in Congress. Please continue following CDC guidelines. Please have a happy, safe and healthy holiday season. And Happy New Year!

MANCHIN HOLDS MEETINGS IN MORGANTOWN, PARKERSBURG, WHEELING TO HIGHLIGHT DIRECT LOCAL RELIEF FUNDING 
West Virginia cities and counties will receive $677 million in direct funding from the American Rescue Plan 
Watch an overview of the meetings here. 

 Charleston, WV – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) met with Wood, Jackson, Wirt, Tyler, Ritchie, Pleasants, Ohio, Hancock, Marshall, Wetzel, Brooke, Monongalia, Marion and Preston county officials to discuss the benefits of millions of dollars in direct local funding coming to West Virginia’s cities and counties following passage of the American Rescue Plan. Senator Manchin voted to pass the COVID-19 relief package, which will bring roughly $4 billion in direct funding to West Virginia with $677 million of that dedicated to West Virginia’s cities and 55 counties.  ""Our local leaders know the needs of their communities best, and I want to make sure that they are able to get the resources they need to recover from the pandemic and address their most pressing issues. My experience serving as Governor helped me understand the needs of our small communities, and whether it’s water, sewer, broadband, police, fire departments or getting every West Virginian vaccinated, this direct relief funding from the American Rescue Plan will help our cities and counties bounce back from the pandemic and make investments in infrastructure that will create jobs and improve West Virginians’ quality of life for generations to come. I was proud to vote for the American Rescue Plan because it will help West Virginia rebuild after this incredibly difficult year and jump-start our economic recovery,"" said Senator Manchin.  ""Our cities and counties have been presented with a massive opportunity.  Our office is here to ensure that this opportunity results in tangible results that benefit the lives of West Virginians. We must avoid the pitfalls of fraud, waste and graft.  We know that transparency, communication and planning are how this is accomplished. We have built a team of people who will build this infrastructure, work with our local government partners and make sure all this information is available,"" said West Virginia Auditor J.B. McCuskey.  For more information on the many ways West Virginians will benefit from the American Rescue Plan and to see how much funding each city and county will receive, click here.

4/23/21 21:00,Serving You,"Dear Friend,

I hope you had a great week! I was in our nation’s capital this week working hard for California's 39th District in Congress. Here are the highlights:

Cutting Taxes for All Californians


Californians in CA-39 and across our state are burdened by some of the highest state and local taxes and costs of living in the country. Unfortunately, middle class families are also being punished with a high federal tax bill each time they file their income taxes with the IRS just for living in California.

If Congress does not repeal the SALT cap, it is estimated that by 2022, the residents of California’s 39th District will pay anywhere between $600-$610 million more in taxes. I am committed to lowering taxes for CA-39 workers and families and making life more affordable. That's why I helped introduce a bipartisan bill to repeal the cap on SALT deductions and am co-chair of the bipartisan SALT Caucus.

I joined the U.S. Conference of Mayors this week for a bipartisan discussion about repealing the SALT cap so hard-working taxpayers in California can keep more of their money. Learn more HERE.

Last Chance to Participate in the 2021 Congressional Art Competition 


It's not too late to enter this year's Congressional Art Competition! The deadline to participate is this Monday, April 26, 2021 at 5pm PT. All high school students are invited to participate for a chance to have their work displayed in the U.S. Capitol for one year. Learn more HERE. 

Strengthening Oversight of COVID-19 Relief Programs


The Small Business Committee met this week to discuss oversight of the Small Business Administration (SBA)’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) Program.

The PPP and EIDL programs have helped countless small businesses in CA-39 during the COVID-19 pandemic. I spoke with SBA Inspector General Mike Ware about the current oversight capabilities of the SBA’s COVID-19 relief programs and how the SBA can ensure fraud is stopped in current and future programs so relief goes to those who need it most.

Pushing a Bipartisan Infrastructure Package





Only together can our country address the long-term sustainability of our nation's infrastructure system. That’s why I’m proud to support the Problem Solvers Caucus's bipartisan infrastructure proposal that I helped put together with the Caucus's Infrastructure Working Group to provide much-needed improvements to infrastructure projects in CA-39 & the U.S. Read the report HERE. 

Pushing to Reunite Divided Korean American Families


This week, the Foreign Affairs Committee passed two bipartisan initiatives I helped introduce to encourage reunions of Korean American families with their war-torn family members in North Korea. Both of these measures now head to the House Floor for a vote.

As a Korean American, I understand and empathize with the great pain that thousands of Korean Americans still feel today over the continued separation of their families. Time is running out to right this wrong, and I thank my colleagues for supporting these two bipartisan efforts.

Helping Others Pursue Their American Dream


As one of the first Korean American women to serve in Congress, I hope I can inspire others to pursue their American dream. I joined the Korea Society for a conversation with former U.S. Ambassador to Korea Kathleen Stephens on my story, helping other women, my work for CA-39 in Congess, U.S.-South Korea priorities and more. Watch here.

My Successful Call For The U.S. To Provide Resources To COVID-19 Surging Countries, Such As India
 
On Saturday, I released a statement calling on the Biden Administration to provide pandemic resources – specifically our domestically unusable stockpile of AstraZeneca vaccine – to countries currently experiencing deadly surges in COVID-19, including India and Argentina. This week, India announced daily records of more than 300,000 new COVID-19 cases, and reports from other hotspots across the globe are similarly alarming.
 
While it’s been shown to be safe and effective in the countries which have approved its use, the AstraZeneca vaccine does not currently have FDA authorization, and because the company has not pursued authorization, we won’t be able to use our stock of this vaccine to save lives here, even as our supplies of the Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines continue to grow. Because of this unique situation, sharing our supply of the AstraZeneca vaccine with countries in need of help is the humane choice and the smart one. Those vaccines will only sit in warehouses if we keep them here, but they can save millions of lives abroad while helping to contain new strains of COVID-19 and preventing those dangerous new variants from causing additional and more dangerous outbreaks here.
 
Two days after I urged the President to act, the Biden Administration announced that the United States would share up to 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine with countries in need while also providing PPE, oxygen, and other desperately needed resources to our partners across the world. 
 
 

  
In this New York Times hotspot map, the darker red countries are currently experiencing the highest daily cases
 
 
Since the virus does not stay within countries’ borders, ending this pandemic must be a coordinated, international effort. I was glad to see that the Biden Administration heeded my calls to distribute the AstraZeneca vaccine, and now our actions must outpace the spread of the virus globally and protect the progress of our domestic response.

My Work To Ban Menthol-Flavored Cigarettes, To Protect Public Health And Racial Equity
 
Last week, I wrote to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with Senator Durbin and Congressman Rush asking it to ban menthol-flavored cigarettes. The purpose of this ban would be to end the abusive marketing and advertising practices used by tobacco companies aimed at African Americans and youth.  The more addictive qualities of menthol-flavored cigarettes combined with its disproportionate impact on the African American community have caused a public health crisis. 
 
Today, I was pleased to see that the FDA has responded to my letter and the need for action by announcing it would ban the sale of these flavored cigarettes. This is a huge victory for public health and racial justice that will save lives at a time when smoking-related illnesses are the number one cause of death for African Americans.
 
Subcommittee On The Environment Hearing With Greta Thunberg
 
On Earth Day last week, I participated in the Oversight Subcommittee on the Environment hearing on fossil fuels and the climate crisis. I was happy to speak with Greta Thunberg, a young climate advocate who has garnered an international following and admiration for her work. During the hearing, she encouraged young people to take the time to learn about the ongoing environmental issues. In response to my question about workers in the fossil fuel industry, she commented that “climate justice is social justice” and that we will leave no one behind as we develop policies to fight climate change. I’m committed to working on legislation in Congress that advances the United States toward green technology while also providing economic opportunity and job creation.

Select Subcommittee On The Coronavirus Crisis Hearing On Vaccines and Public Health Measures
 
Last week, I participated in the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis hearing regarding the state of the pandemic and our progress in the vaccine rollout. During the hearing, I asked Dr. Fauci to indicate the dangers of vaccine misinformation spreading, whether online or through news channels. One survey found that 23% of the population is hesitant to get the vaccine. By holding hearings with healthcare professionals like Dr. Fauci, we can educate the public on the safety and efficacy of the vaccine.
 
During my questioning, I highlighted this map of COVID-19 rates across the United States pictured below. As we saw throughout 2020, some states suffered far worse than others due to lacking state public health guidelines. As a member of the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, I will continue to analyze our pandemic response and track our vaccine rollout.

The Recent Mass Shootings And The Rise In Hate Crimes
 
The United States has had 147 mass shootings in 2021, 45 of which have occurred in the past month. Last Thursday, eight people died in a mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis. These tragedies do not have to be commonplace in America. As our nation mourns, this most recent shooting is another example of the need for gun reform. I’m proud to have been a cosponsor on the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, which passed the House, and to have introduced my COOL OFF Act to impose waiting periods on handgun sales.
 
Of the victims in this FedEx shooting, four of them were members of the Sikh community. In response and given that many workers at the FedEx warehouse were members of the local Sikh community, I’ve called for an investigation of potential anti-Sikh motivations. This rise in Asian-American hate crimes requires a swift government response. I’ve reintroduced my Hate Crimes Commission Act this Congress to study the rise in hate crimes and determine policy responses. We have a strong, proud Sikh community in our district, and on this “Sikh Awareness and Appreciation Month” in the state of Illinois – and every month – we stand with them. 
 
House Intelligence Hearing On World Wide Threats
 
Last week, I participated in the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence hearing on World Wide Threats. The American public is concerned with China’s threat to the United States’ security and economy. When asked about the capabilities of Communist President Xi Jinping, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI), Avril Haines, stated to me that his power has only grown. During the hearing, I also asked the Director of the National Security Agency (NSA), Gen. Paul Nakasone, whether China has the capability to disrupt electrical grids in the United States. In response, Gen. Nakasone, said that “our adversaries are getting much better” and that we need to focus on our critical infrastructure.
 
During questioning, the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Christopher Wray, indicated that there may be instances in which foreign non-state actors offered various kinds of support to domestic violent extremist groups in the U.S. The rise in domestic extremism and the potential involvement of foreign entities is a direct threat to our security, and I’m working to ensure that our agencies have the proper resources to respond.

Congressional Report
 
 
Dear Friend,
 
I am back at our nation’s Capital, working to pass critical pieces of legislation that will help move our nation forward. Last week, I voted for the Paycheck Fairness Act that will put money in the pockets of struggling workers and families and finally fulfill the promise of equal pay. I also voted to pass the Workplace Violence Prevention for Health Care and Social Service Workers Act, which would help provide safer workplaces for these employees and would drive down preventable incidents.
 
Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, every adult in the US is now eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine. Find your vaccine here. 
 
As a reminder, now is not the time to let our guard down. Please continue to wear your mask, social distance, stay home if feeling ill and receive a vaccine when possible. With many businesses and schools reopening, let's remain vigilant in our efforts to slow the spread and defeat the virus.  
 
If you need help with stimulus checks, federal benefits, small business aid, or more, please contact my office. For more updates throughout the district and in DC, follow me on social media @repcuellar.

 
 
Reps. Cuellar and Katko Discuss Bipartisan Bill to Address Migrant Surges at the Border
 
 

 
  
The humanitarian crisis we’re seeing at the US-Mexico border is not new, yet it’s time we stop being reactive rather than proactive in our strategic response. On Thursday, April 15, Congressman John Katko (R-NY) and I spoke with FOX Business about introducing our bipartisan bill - Border Surge Response and Resilience Act.
 
This act would require DHS and federal partners to establish a plan to address migrant surges at the border with transparent metrics in place to activate access to supplemental funds. It would also hold interagency components accountable to mitigate bottlenecks that take law enforcement off the line and result in children being held in CBP custody for longer than they should.

 
 
The Social Barber Ribbon Cutting in Laredo
 

  
On Thursday, April 15th, my Outreach Coordinator for Webb, Zapata, La Salle and McMullen Counties, Melissa Pena, attended the ribbon cutting ceremony of The Social Barber. While there, Melissa presented the shop's owners Manuel and Erika Gomez, with a Certificate of Recognition to honor the grand opening and welcome them to our community. This upscale barber shop, at the Shoppes of Shiloh, offers a relaxing and luxurious experience to all their customers! Services include: hair and beard, nails, massage, skin, shoe shine and a bar.

On Wednesday, April 14th, my Outreach Coordinator for Webb, Zapata, La Salle and McMullen Counties, Melissa Pena, visited the Zapata County Sheriff's Office to check in with County Sheriff Rey Del Bosque, Commissioner Joey Solis, and Telecommunicator Supervisor Eliza Lozano. Melissa and Sheriff Del Bosque discussed the need for maintenance on the county's Power Tower, which affects all law enforcement radios in the area.  
 
My office continues to work with Zapata County to address their needs and find federal grants that can help relieve some of these community issues.

Hidalgo County PCT. 3 Press Conference on the Border Levee System
 

  
That same Wednesday, further south, my Outreach Coordinator for Hidalgo and Starr Counties, Nicolas Cruz, participated in a press conference with Hidalgo County Precinct 3 to address the vulnerable state of the RGV Flood Control System. 
 
In light of President Biden's Proclamation, which paused the construction of the border wall, it has come to my attention that dirt levees in Hidalgo County have been left severely compromised. This poses a dangerous risk to residents in Hidalgo County and its surrounding areas, especially as hurricane season approaches and the threat of flooding intensifies. I will continue to work with the County on finding a resolution to this issue of public safety.
 
Pictured is Nicolas Cruz relaying my statement on the matter to local officials and press.

12/7/20 21:25,Fighting to Fund Oregon’s Top Priorities,"Getting a Coronavirus Vaccine to Every Corner of Oregon 
As Oregon continues to battle an unprecedented spike in coronavirus infections, there’s a lot of work left for each of us to do to drive this pandemic into the ground. We each have the power to keep our guards up by staying home when we can, wearing a mask, and limiting contact with those outside of your households. There’s also a lot of work left for the government to do, from passing another much-needed coronavirus relief package -- which Jeff has been pushing for -- to ensuring that we have the critical supplies and infrastructure in place to keep responding to the crisis.   That infrastructure must include the ultra-cold storage containers that will be necessary to store and distribute some coronavirus vaccines. So last month, Jeff teamed up with 11 of his Senate colleagues in urging the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to work with state, tribal, territorial, and local stakeholders to identify gaps in ultra-cold storage. The push included an emphasis on rural and underserved communities, in order to help ensure that people across America -- and in every corner of Oregon -- have the storage capabilities needed to prevent supply shortages once vaccines start being distributed. 

 
Covering the Costs of Our Wildfire Recovery 
Thanks to rain and the hard work of our dedicated firefighters, the catastrophic wildfires that broke out in September have been largely extinguished. But there’s still a lot of work ahead of us to address the damage created by the unprecedented blazes. That’s why Jeff and his colleagues in the Oregon congressional delegation are requesting that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) provide critical support, including an increase in the Federal cost share for debris removal costs related to the fires. 

Usually, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments pay 25 percent of FEMA assistance costs. But given how widespread and severe the damage from the fires is, the delegation is requesting that the federal government waive the 25 percent requirement, and cover the entire cost. 

""In the span of a few short days, fires burned an area the size of the State of Rhode Island. As a result, thousands of our fellow Oregonians have been displaced, and countless businesses have been lost. Furthermore, the State and local governments continue to respond to and recover from four additional Presidentially-declared disasters since May 2019, including three counties which are covered under both Major Disaster Declarations from floods and the wildfire disaster last month… Oregon and her citizens are suffering under the strain of enormous calamity,” the lawmakers wrote as they outlined their request in a letter to FEMA Administrator Peter Gaynor.
 
Fighting to Fund Oregon’s Top Priorities 
Last week, Jeff announced that he has used his seat on the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee to include in the Senate’s spending bills a wide variety of investments to help create jobs, support affordable housing, and improve infrastructure in every corner of Oregon.   ""Every year I do a town hall in every county of Oregon so I can hear firsthand what all of our communities need to thrive, and then I bring that input to Congress to push investments and strategies that can make a real difference in people’s lives,” Jeff said in the announcement.   Those investments include key provisions to help keep Oregonians safe and help them thrive. Jeff fought to include $1.34 billion for fire suppression at the Forest Service and Department of the Interior, and $40 million for the Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP). Oregon currently has three active CFLR projects, which are helping restore our forests and reduce the risk of future catastrophic fires.   In addition, the bill includes $85 million for the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to support regional earthquake initiatives including $25.7 million for the West Coast ShakeAlert early warning project. The bill also encourages the USGS to continue developing a system to help prepare for and mitigate the negative human and economic impacts of a major seismic event in the Pacific Northwest.   Jeff also fought for funding to support affordable housing and homelessness services -- including $3.455 billion for the Community Development Block Grant Program, which funds vital housing rehabilitation, supportive services, public improvements and economic development projects. Jeff successfully advocated to help keep roofs over the heads of low-income families, seniors, and people with disabilities in Oregon, by leading the charge for $833 million in funding to continue rental assistance for 1.2 million households and protecting funding for housing programs that benefit the elderly. Additionally, Jeff made sure the bill would include nearly $3 billion for Homeless Assistance Grants, $40 million in rental assistance funding for homeless veterans, case management, and clinical services, and more.   These funding items help every corner of our state, and Jeff also worked to secure funding for the particular programs that help each of Oregon’s unique communities -- from dredging small ports on the coast, to PILT in Southern Oregon, wine grapes in the Willamette Valley, irrigation modernization in Central Oregon, and wind energy and dry land farming in Eastern Oregon. For the complete list of programs Jeff fought to secure, click here. The next step for the bill is passage through both houses of Congress -- potentially as soon as this week.

Q&A: What’s Ahead in 2021

Q: What’s on the agenda in the new Congress? 
Q: What policy priorities will you push from the Senate Judiciary Committee? 
Quick Links
Iowans must have confidence we are receiving our fair share of vaccines. While the CDC routinely releases the state-by-state vaccine data for allocation, doses delivered and administration, it is difficult to determine based on this data whether Iowa is receiving its fair share.
This is why Senator Ernst and I are calling on the CDC to publish the week-to-week formula. Transparency will ensure Iowans and all Americans can confirm the federal government is fairly allocating vaccines and build confidence in the vaccine distribution process. 
In the middle of a pandemic, the federal government must also do everything it can to protect the inmates in its care. In 2018, the First Step Act established important home confinement and early release programs, which are especially important right now. 
The COVID-19 Safer Detention Act would clarify and expand those programs we wrote into the First Step Act, so we can better protect older and vulnerable populations.

2/12/21 15:53,Supporting Workers | An Innovation Economy,"February 12, 2021
Dear Lindsey,  
As we continue our efforts to distribute the COVID-19 vaccine and bring relief to American families, we must also look ahead to our next major challenge: revitalizing our economy. That is why this week I advocated to raise the federal minimum wage, renewed my call to invest in an innovation economy, and announced the passage of my legislation that will put Americans back to work.
 
 Raise The Wage 
 
 

 
 
No one should ever struggle to pay bills or put food on their table after working their full-time job. But this is the reality for far too many families in our nation. It has been over a decade since the last time we raised the federal minimum to $7.25—the longest Americans have gone without an increase since the minimum wage's creation. 
 
Raising the minimum wage is the tide that will lift all boats, put money into the pockets of the American people when they need it most, and bring desperately needed relief to families.
 
Video: My comments on the minimum wage
 
 Innovation Investments 
COVID-19 has posed an unprecedented challenge to our nation, and should be met with unprecedented action, investment, and ingenuity. That is why I renewed the push for my legislation, The Innovation Centers Acceleration Act. 
 
This bill would invest $80 billion in select cities across the country that are set up to support innovation, create jobs, and drive economic growth—and I believe Monroe County is poised for this kind of opportunity.
 
You don't have to take my word for it, either. This legislation has support from research and industry experts, including MIT Economist Simon Johnson, who agrees Rochester is a top location to develop innovation and sustain long-term economic growth.

 Apprenticeship Opportunities 
 
Legislation I authored to bolster apprenticeship opportunities across America passed in the House of Representatives last week, as part of the National Apprenticeship Act. Apprenticeships are a proven investment to not only grow our economy but provide workers with financial stability and security, something our nation needs as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Dear Neighbor,
 
February is Black History Month, a time to celebrate and honor the Black community, and highlight African Americans’ accomplishments of the past and innovations of today.
 
Throughout the month, I will be sharing stories and talking about  CA-44's African American leaders, organizers, and community members. How will you be celebrating Black History Month? Whether by reading books, sharing family stories, helping out your neighbor or buying from Black-owned businesses, please share your story or pictures here. (By submitting, you give consent for the content to potentially be used in my communications.)
  

  
This has been a challenging time for many of us and these experiences have made it clear that everyone deserves to have access to the healthcare – including mental healthcare – that they need. In recognition of Black History Month, the Black Mental Health Task Force will be hosting a virtual fair and workshop on February 25th, 2021 at 10:30 am PST. You are  encouraged to call the LACDMH’s 24/7 Help Line to request mental health support, resources and referrals at (800) 854-7771 if you or someone you know needs support and services.
 
It's Super Bowl Sunday! It's on all of us to make sure today isn't a super spreader event. Stop the spread and watch the big game from home.
 
In this newsletter you will find COVID updates, community resources, and updates from DC. 
  
 
COVID-19 Vaccine Updates
 
Vaccine Update
 
We are aware that many constituents are having a hard time getting an appointment for the vaccine. If you have internet access, please check the site each morning because new appointments are added. Just yesterday same day appointments were added for the vaccine at Dodger Stadium.
 
Remember there is a limited supply and there are barriers that prevent many from getting an appointment such as lack of access to internet, transportation to a vaccine site or language barriers. Know that my office and I are doing all we can to make sure the vaccine is reaching the most vulnerable and hardest hit COVID-19 communities.
 
This week I wrote to President Biden and Governor Newsom asking them to make sure the distribution of vaccines is equitable and that they use creative ways to get vaccines in the right arms- the most vulnerable. For example, I am calling on the use of mobile units to go into communities to bring the vaccine directly to the people, make the vaccine available at more community health centers and pharmacies, plus provide an option for those who cannot fill out a form online or get an appointment online. Bottom line is we need more vaccination sites in and near our congressional district. I will not stop until we get this done -- it is a top priority.
 
 
Reminder: These L.A. county residents are currently eligible for the vaccine:
	•	Over 65 years old
	•	Healthcare workers
	•	Staff and residents at skilled nursing facilities
	•	Staff and residents at long-term facilities
	•	In home health services workers (IHHS) can register for the vaccine as a healthcare workers. Bring a paystub from IHHS and photo ID.
 
Visit VaccinateLAcounty.com to book an appointment – appointments are required. Residents with disabilities or without computer access can call 833-540-0473 between 8:00 am and 8:30 pm 7 days a week for assistance with appointments. 
 
If you live in Long Beach, educators, childcare workers, food or agricultural workers and government emergency responders now also qualify for the vaccine. Check the city website for an appointment and eligibility.
 
  


  
If you are having trouble navigating the appointment system, please contact my office at (310) 831-1799 and we will do our best to assist you. Please bear in mind that vaccines and appointments are still very limited and that is likely to be the case for at least the next few weeks. Please be patient!
 
Our COVID numbers in California are finally getting better. Southern California’s ICU capacity is now 11 percent, which is still concerning but showing signs of improvement. Hospitalizations and the rate of positive COVID tests are also going down. This good news means your efforts to stay home, wear a mask, and keep your distance are working. Keep it up! We still have to protect each other until everyone can get vaccinated which is going to take several months.   
  
Feel sick or worried about exposure? Schedule your FREE COVID-19 test at coronavirus.lacity.org/testing or call 3-1-1. Upcoming free testing in our community includes:

2/16/21 10:20,Weekly Update:  U.S. Attorneys Should Be Allowed To Conclude Their Important Work,"Weekly Update | February 13, 2021
 

U.S. Attorneys Should Be Allowed To Conclude Their Important Work

While U.S. Attorneys ultimately serve at the pleasure of the President, I believe it would be reckless and irresponsible for President Biden to fire U.S. Attorneys John Lausch, of the Northern District of Illinois, and John Milhiser, of the Central District of Illinois, without successors nominated and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. U.S. Attorney Lausch is currently pursuing a historic and major public corruption investigation involving a years-long bribery scheme that has implicated former House Speaker Michael Madigan and others. U.S. Attorney Milhiser recently announced an indictment against former State Senator Sam McCann for criminal charges, including fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion.
 
There is precedent for allowing a U.S. Attorney to remain in office until successors are confirmed, and I strongly believe both should be allowed to do so. I urge President Biden to permit U.S. Attorneys Lausch and Milhiser to remain in their jobs to conclude their ongoing corruption investigations and criminal cases.

Talking With K-12 School Administrators on Re-Opening
 

Pictured above: I talked with K-12 school administrators during a virtual listening session on Wednesday, February 10th 

On Wednesday, I hosted a Virtual COVID-19 Listening Session with K-12 School Administrators with two dozen school districts from across the 13th Congressional District participating. The discussion focused on the status of each district's transition back to in-person learning and what needs to happen to accomplish that transition. There were three common issues raised by local school administrators: funding, vaccines, and public health guidance. 

The vast majority of schools across my district are providing full-time or at least partial in-person learning and I am grateful for the administrators, teachers, and students for making that happen. I represent both rural and urban school districts and recognize they face different sets of challenges, but it is important we all work together to get schools reopened. 

I voted for additional federal funding for schools and vaccine distribution in December and that funding is on the way. Our kids deserve the best learning environment we can give them. That is undeniably in-person instruction and the science shows we can make that happen sooner rather than later.

You can learn more about our discussion here. 
 


Talking With County Health Departments on COVID-19 Vaccine Administration
 

Pictured above: I listened to county health department administrators during a virtual listening session on Monday, February 8th

On Monday, I hosted a Virtual COVID-19 Listening Session with County Health Departments with most all department administrators across the 13th Congressional District participating. The discussion focused on vaccine administration, testing operations, and contact tracing. Bolstering vaccine supply, funding to get shots in arms, and earlier notification of dosage allotments to improve planning were the main areas local leaders indicated they need support from the state and federal government. 

Our local county health departments are doing an admirable job of getting vaccines administered while still continuing testing and contact tracing operations. I heard clear and consistently that departments need more vaccines, further advance communication of allotments for planning purposes, and additional funding to get shots into arms. 

In December I voted for legislation that included billions of dollars for purchasing vaccines and distributing them. I will continue to listen to our public health officials leading the fight against the pandemic to see how we can best support their efforts. The sooner we get people vaccinated the sooner we can get back to normal. 

I continue to urge the Governor to take steps necessary to get shots into arms. With hard-working, capable county health department staff like the folks I spoke to yesterday there is no reason our state should be ranked at the tail-end of most vaccination measures.

Editorial: ""Biden Sacks a Corruption Prober""

President Joe Biden and his Department of Justice announced their intent to terminate dozens of U.S. Attorneys across the country, including John Lausch of the Northern District of Illinois. Editorial boards and lawmakers from both parties urged President Biden to allow Lausch to stay on the job until he concludes his work and a successor is confirmed.

From the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board: Biden Sacks a Corruption Prober: 

“A new President abruptly fires a prosecutor overseeing high-level political corruption cases. That’s big news, right? Well, it was in 2017 when President Trump axed Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York at the time and a media favorite. You can tell power in Washington has changed hands because of the muted response as the Biden White House ousts U.S. Attorney John Lausch of the Northern District of Illinois.
 
“Joe Biden is swiftly pushing out almost all U.S. attorneys who served under his predecessor, which is increasingly the norm for new Presidents. But even Illinois Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, staunch allies of Mr. Biden, objected to his firing of Mr. Lausch, who has been a scourge of corruption in Democratic-dominated Springfield.
 
“…Mr. Lausch’s corruption probes have implicated a Chicago alderman and Springfield politicians. In July 2020 his office announced a $200 million settlement with the state’s primary electric utility company for its efforts to buy off “associates of a high-level elected official for the state of Illinois.”
 
“That official is reported to be Michael Madigan, who until last month had been Speaker of the Illinois House for all but two years since 1983. The investigation is continuing, and there’s no reason outside of politics that Mr. Lausch shouldn’t be kept on the job until the Senate confirms a successor. Mr. Lausch’s four-year term ends in November 2021, and getting a replacement could take that long…”

From the Chicago Tribune Editorial Board: President Biden: Keep our U.S. Attorney John Lausch: 

“President Joe Biden’s Justice Department dismissed U.S. attorneys across the country appointed by former President Donald Trump on Tuesday, and Northern District of Illinois U.S. Attorney John Lausch appears to be out. That would be a terrible decision by Biden.
 
“…And what a coincidence that the politicians indicted, charged or under investigation so far happen to be mostly Democrats. Dismissing Lausch will look like a Biden-Durbin-Duckworth favor to their corrupt Democrat pals.
 
“…Lausch also has been helping Mayor Lori Lightfoot in Chicago with violent crime. The effort known as Operation Legend, which fanned across several U.S. cities to battle increases in crime, was credited as of last fall with 262 charges of firearm offenses in the Northern District, a number 33% higher than 2018 and 48% higher than 2017, according to the Trump Justice Department.”

2/21/21 14:20,An Update from Congressman David Kustoff,"Dear Friends,

This week, I questioned Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman about the market volatility that happened in January with GameStop. I believe it is vital that we ensure adequate protection for everyday investors, and increase their participation in the market going forward. Watch my full questioning by clicking here or the photo below.
 
 

Many West Tennesseans are concerned that the mailbox units the U.S. Postal Service requires for their housing developments do not suit the community’s needs. This week, I introduced the Easy Access to Mail Act which will enable our local communities to work with the USPS to fix this issue. This bill will prohibit USPS from retroactively requiring home builders to install cluster mailboxes at new housing developments and would require one-time approval from a local legislative body regarding the placement of cluster mailboxes.

4/8/21 8:31,Here's What You Might Have Missed During My Time in the District,"NEWSLETTER
 
 
WEBSITE     |     CONTACT     


Dear neighbor,  
We are wrapping up another busy district work session this week. From food drives to vaccine clinics, I’ve been so heartened to see PA-05 neighbors continuing to support each other, with determination to weather the pandemic and make it through to the other side. 
 
While it’s still important to mask up and follow public health guidelines, we can cautiously say that the light at the end of the tunnel is growing brighter. Thanks to American medical science and ingenuity we have three highly effective vaccines approved, and over the last few weeks, we’ve seen production ramping up and supply increasing every day. 
 
This week, our region got a dramatic increase in vaccine supply—particularly to Delaware and Montgomery Counties, which for weeks had received far fewer vaccines than predicted, or needed. Thanks to the focus and teamwork of local representatives and public servants, the tide is turning and more vaccine appointments are available. And we welcome the news that vaccine distribution will open this month to all adults this month. 
 
Here are a few highlights from my recent time in the district:
 
Welcomed President Biden and Secretary Cardona to PA-05
On March 16, Representative Houlahan and I were honored to join President Biden for his visit to Smith Flooring in Chester. We met with owners Kristin and James, talked about how COVID has impacted their work, and discussed how the American Rescue Plan will help support both employers and workers. 
 
A few weeks later, on April 7, Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona came to Delaware County to tour two local schools. Secretary Cardona spoke to students about the return to in-person learning and how the Biden Administration is working to help more schools reopen. I’m looking forward to working with the Secretary on school infrastructure, early childhood education, student loan reform and more as he settles into his new role.   

 Visited Penn Terminals in Eddystone
I had a great visit with the folks at Penn Terminals to discuss the new direct container shipping route between Cork, Ireland and the Port of Chester. The Philadelphia region’s ports are uniquely positioned geographically to serve as a gateway to the entire Northeast, and import more than a third of our fresh produce annually. 
 
This is the first direct shipping route between Ireland and the United States in many years, and it provides both countries a fast and reliable route for food, beverages, pharmaceuticals, and more. Chester is Pennsylvania’s oldest city and, in part due to its place along the Delaware River, was integral in the early economic success of our Commonwealth. The city’s waterfront and business district are undergoing a renaissance, and the whole area has a lot of potential. 
 
Volunteered at an Upper Darby food pantry
While the increase in food insecurity over the past year has been dramatic, we are so grateful to those who have stepped up to help their neighbors. Desiree LaMarr-Murphy runs an incredible weekly food pantry from her backyard, coordinating a vast network of food donors and volunteers on her own. We were honored to lend a hand at the pantry and to hear from Desiree and her neighbors about the issues they are facing.
 
Read more about Desiree’s food pantry and her inspiring story here. 
 
Worked with Rite Aid to bring vaccination clinics to underserved communities
My team and I have been working hard to get more vaccine doses to PA-05, and particularly to communities that have the most trouble accessing health care. We looked at neighborhoods in the 5th Congressional District that lacked access to vaccines and were able to work with Rite Aid, one of the companies supplying federally allocated doses at retail pharmacies, to bring vaccination clinics to some of those neighborhoods. With Rite Aid’s support, we helped identify trusted community organizations to create one-day pop-up clinics to bring vaccines to communities in need.  
 
So far, we’ve helped bring almost a thousand additional doses to PA-05. I want to thank Rite Aid, Eastwick United Methodist Church in Philadelphia, Widener University in Chester, the City of Chester Health Department and Union Memorial United Methodist Church in Darby for their hard work to organize and staff these clinics.
 
Hosted discussion with PHS about the 2021 Flower Show and other projects
We are so excited that the first-ever outdoor Philadelphia Flower Show will take place in PA-05 this year. We talked with the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society about this year’s signature event, as well as other community projects from PHS, including improving the tree canopy, greening vacant lots, community gardens, and a reentry program during a Coffee with Your Congresswoman conversation on Facebook Live.
 


Gathered with neighbors for a Stop Anti-Asian Hate Vigil at FDR Park
Over the past year, we have witnessed a disturbing rise in violence against Asian Americans. And while we know the AAPI community is no stranger to hate speech and crimes, it is clear that vile rhetoric at the national level and the ongoing pandemic have fueled an alarming rise in such crimes. 

I joined my colleagues and neighbors this weekend to say, unequivocally, to our AAPI residents: You belong here. You are Pennsylvanians. This is your home. And we will stand with you to fight back against hate and racism.
 
Hosted a Coffee with Your Congresswoman on Mentoring 
I recently became Chair of Congress’ Youth Mentoring Caucus, a bipartisan group of members dedicated to building support for the mentoring movement on Capitol Hill. My family has been involved in mentoring for years, and we’ve seen the significant role that mentors play in the lives of young people—helping them achieve academically and prepare for adult life. 
 
The past year has been very challenging for kids and young people, and they are facing some real setbacks, such as academic learning loss, mental health struggles, and a lack of job opportunities. It's so important that they have a trusted adult in their lives to help them navigate today's challenges. I spoke to the heads of several local mentorship programs to learn more about how young people from our district can get involved. 
 
Listen to our conversation here.
 
My team and I also took part in other community events while I was home in the district, including:
	•	Joined folks from Friendship Circle Senior Center in Darby at the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge for a morning walk.  
	•	Helped clean up Deshong Park in Chester with local leaders.  
	•	Attend the ribbon-cutting for a new health center in Chester.  
	•	Spoke to the Delta Tau Chapter of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Inc. at Cheyney University 
	•	Answered questions from college students at Bryn Mawr and Haverford.  
 
Next week I’m headed back to D.C. to work on more legislation that will help the people of PA-05. I hope you’ll follow along on social media to see what I’m up to while Congress is in session!
  Sincerely, 
Mary Gay

Dear Friend, 
 
This week began with a deployment ceremony for the Charlie Company 3/172nd Infantry Regiment of the New Hampshire National Guard (NHNG) on Monday as they prepared for a yearlong deployment to the Middle East in support of Operation Spartan Shield. From supporting our communities during the COVID-19 pandemic to protecting our nation’s capital during the peaceful transition of power to serving abroad and so much more — the bravery and patriotism of the men and women of our National Guard have made the Granite State Proud. We owe them — and their families — a debt of gratitude for their service as we pray for their safety.

It was a somber moment on Wednesday morning when I honored the life, service, and sacrifice of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died from injuries sustained while defending the U.S. Capitol — and our very democracy — from a mob of pro-Trump insurrectionists on January 6th. To lie in honor in the Rotunda of the Capitol is a fitting tribute to the courage and sacrifice of Officer Sicknick. My heart is with his family, friends, and colleagues.

This week, the Energy and Commerce Committee held its first hearings of the 117th Congress in both the Oversight and Investigations and Health Subcommittees. I’m proud to serve on this influential committee to advance legislation to crush COVID-19 and help us move forward. I recently introduced two different bills to ramp up vaccine production and ensure that we can get vaccines into arms as quickly and efficiently as possible. This Congress, I will be rejoining the House Agriculture Committee where I look forward to bringing the voices of Granite State farmers and producers to Washington as I work to advance the priorities of New Hampshire’s agriculture economy.
 
 
 

 
An update from outside the Capitol
 
 
Working to End the COVID-19 Pandemic and Get Vaccines into Arms
 
 
The Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee held a hearing on Tuesday to examine the distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States. While it’s taken remarkable, unprecedented efforts to get safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines developed, authorized and distributed around the country, it won’t be enough to curb the spread of the virus if we cannot get vaccines into arms quickly.
 
 
 

 
 Questioning witnesses during the Oversight & Investigations Subcommittee hearing
 
 
In the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee on Wednesday, we held a hearing appropriately titled, “Road to Recovery: Ramping Up COVID-19 Vaccines, Testing, and Medical Supply Chain.” At this hearing, we heard from public health professionals and supply chain experts that one of the keys to getting the COVID-19 crisis under control is ensuring we use these vaccines to their full capacity and improve our health data systems. I’m glad that Congress has put resources toward modernizing our public health data infrastructure, but it is clear that we need to do more. Through my role on the Energy and Commerce Committee, I will continue working to ensure that our supply and infrastructure meet the demands of this public health crisis. 
 
 
 

 
 
Questioning witnesses during the Health Subcommittee hearing
 Yesterday, I joined a call with Congressman Chris Pappas and the New Hampshire Hospital Association’s members and leadership to discuss New Hampshire’s COVID-19 response, the current capacity of hospitals, the ongoing distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and federal support for New Hampshire’s health care system. I look forward to my continued work across the aisle with my colleagues in the House and Senate, as well as the Biden-Harris administration to advocate for adequate and robust support for our hospitals, rural health systems, and providers.
 
 

  
 
Speaking to the New Hampshire Hospital Association members and leadership
 Today, I spoke on the House floor to call for my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to prioritize getting the COVID-19 vaccines equitably and efficiently distributed and administered. The development of two highly-effective vaccines in under one year is an unprecedented scientific accomplishment, but this effort is only truly recognized when we can get vaccines widely distributed. There is no greater public health priority than getting this vaccine into the arm of every American who wants it, and I’m committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure the equitable distribution of the vaccine.
 
 
 

 
 Speaking on the House floor urging Congress to take action on distributing the COVID-19 vaccines
 
 
The Biden Administration Continues to Deliver Good News
 
 
As we reach the end of the second full week of the Biden-Harris Administration, I am feeling more hopeful about the future of our nation. This week, the Biden administration struck a deal with Australian manufacturer Ellume to secure what will be the country’s first over-the-counter, at-home COVID-19 test. Just like vaccines and precautions such as wearing masks and practicing physical distancing, access to COVID-19 testing is key to keeping people safe and combating the spread of the virus. At-home tests will make it easier for people to find out if they are infected so they can take steps to stop the spread and keep their communities safe. 

I applaud the Biden-Harris administration for creating a family reunification task force. The practice of separating families at the border was one of the most despicable exploits of the Trump administration that I personally witnessed at a facility in McAllen, Texas. The heartless, shameful family separation policies caused lasting trauma and pain for thousands of children and families.

I’m also thrilled the administration is creating a new Gender Policy Council – a reformulation of the Obama administration’s White House Council on Women and Girls. Some of the goals of this council include restoring and expanding reproductive rights, combating gender-based violence, reducing maternal mortality, and adding the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution.

This week, several of President Biden’s cabinet nominees were confirmed and sworn in, including our new Transportation Secretary, Pete Buttigieg. COVID-19 has highlighted the urgent need for us to advance and improve our infrastructure in the Granite State and across the country. I look forward to working with Secretary Buttigieg and the talented, experienced, diverse team that the President is building to ensure we rise to the challenges facing our communities and build back better.
 
 
 
Working to Expand Access to Mental Health Resources, Treatment for Substance Use Disorder
 
 
As the founder and co-chair of the Bipartisan Opioid Task Force, I am proud of my work with both Republicans and Democrats to address substance misuse and expand access to treatment and resources. I introduced the Emergency Support for Substance Use Disorders Act with Congressman John Katko (R-NY) on Tuesday. The ‘new normal’ during the COVID-19 pandemic has added additional stress for those struggling with substance use disorder and this health crisis has made it more difficult for many to get the treatment that they need. Our legislation will help ensure that funding can reach providers so that Granite Staters at risk of substance misuse have access to the care and support they need.
 As we contend with the dual crises of COVID-19 and untreated mental health and substance use disorders, funding for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is urgently needed. I helped to lead a bipartisan letter urging congressional leadership to include robust funding for SAMHSA in the next COVID-19 relief bill. 
 
 
 
Celebrating Black History Month
 
 This Black History Month, I’m celebrating the inauguration of our nation’s first female, Black vice president, Kamala Harris! She may be the first, but she will not be the last. I’m also celebrating incredible young Black voices, like Amanda Gorman, who captivated worldwide attention when she read her poem, “The Hill We Climb” at President Biden and Vice President Harris’s inauguration ceremony last month. Amanda is an inspirational young leader, and I look forward to seeing what she does next. You can read her interview with former First Lady Michelle Obama here. 
 
 
 
News You Can Use
 
 
It breaks my heart every time another friend or colleague reveals that they are a survivor of sexual assault, but sadly, it’s not surprising. By bravely opening up about her history of trauma and sharing her experience during the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is helping to destigmatize these important conversations. I commend her for her courage. As a sexual assault survivor and victim of the January 6th terror attack, I was profoundly moved when Rep. Ocasio-Cortez said that “trauma compounds on each other.” If you or someone you know are experiencing sexual assault, abuse, or domestic violence, you are not alone and help is available. The NH Coalition Against Domestic & Sexual Violence (NHCADSV) has resources available. The NH Domestic Violence Hotline is at 866-644-3574 and the NH Sexual Assault Hotline is at 800-277-5570 – both are confidential and available 24/7.
 This week, I helped to announce over $12.6 million in federal CARES Act funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for St. Joseph Hospital in Nashua. Since the pandemic began, St. Joseph Hospital has been providing lifesaving care to Granite Staters in one of the hardest-hit regions of the state. This CARES Act funding will help the health care professionals at St. Joseph continue to provide care and services to people in need in the southern tier.
 
 

 
 
Sign-ups for Phase 1B of New Hampshire’s COVID-19 vaccination process are now open. Phase 1B opens vaccine registration to:
	•	Those 65 years or older
	•	Those under 65 but medically vulnerable
	•	Residents or staff of residential facilities
	•	Correctional officers working in facilities 
Confirm your eligibility and register for your vaccination on www.vaccines.nh.gov/. If you need assistance, you can call 2-1-1 for help. 
 
As always, the CDC and the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services are the best resources to turn to during the COVID-19 public health emergency. If you are sick, stay home and call your health care provider. If you live in NH and have questions about coronavirus, dial 211 or visit CDC.gov for more information.
 
To stay updated on my work in Congress and around the Granite State, as well as for important information and resources, like my page on Facebook and follow me on Twitter. 
 
Remember: hope and brighter days are on the way! We’re all in this together, and we will come out stronger on the other side. I hope you have a fun and safe weekend!
 
Sincerely, 
 
Annie

5/21/21 16:46,Congresswoman McClain Weekly Update,"Friend, 
It is my greatest honor to represent Michigan's 10th Congressional District in the United States House of Representatives. I am here to serve you, my constituent. If you need any help with a federal agency, or want to share your opinion, please reach out to my office. 
Standing with Israel

It is upsetting to see Democrat members of Congress stand with Hamas over our ally, Israel. This past week, we have seen conflict arise due to Iran-backed Hamas attacking Israel, and Israel has every right to defend itself. 
I joined my colleagues this week in standing with Israel and showing our support outside of our offices. America will never bow down to terrorists, and we must stand strong with our allies. 
Pelosi Hypocrisy
The Centers for Disease Control announced last week that those vaccinated are allowed to remove their masks in indoor settings. More than 75% of members of the House are vaccinated, but we are still not allowed to remove our masks on the floor. In fact, if we do, we are fined $500. 
Speaker Pelosi has said this is a safety measure. If it truly was a safety measure, then why was she maskless at a packed event at the White House on Thursday afternoon with all unmasked individuals. They were also seated closer together than we are on the House floor. 
This is not about safety. This is not about following the science. This is all about power. Speaker Pelosi is holding onto the slimmest majority in recent history, and she has to keep all the power she can.
Getting People Back to Work
This week, I joined my Michigan colleagues in sending a letter to Governor Whitmer urging her to end participation in the Federal Supplemental Unemployment Insurance program immediately to get people back to work. The government does not belong in the business of keeping people at home when our businesses are struggling to find workers. 
America was built on people fighting to achieve their American Dream. The government must get out of the way and allow the market to flourish and Americans to succeed. 
Click here to read the letter. 
Coast Guard Academy Board of Visitors
I'm honored to have been appointed by Leader McCarthy to serve on the Coast Guard Academy Board of Visitors for the remainder of the 117th Congress. As a member of the House Armed Services Committee, I understand the essential nature of our service academies and how they are vital to attracting the best to our military. I'm excited for this appointment as our district is home to hundreds of miles of shoreline and Coast Guard Air Station Detroit. I look forward to ensuring the Coast Guard Academy continues to provide a topnotch education to its students.

Dear Friend,  Thank you for signing up to receive my email newsletter. These newsletters will cover a variety of topics, including events happening in northeast Indiana, legislation being considered in Congress, and my perspective on current issues. My hope is to keep you updated and informed on how issues in Washington may impact our region. I welcome your feedback. 
It's Time to Pursue an Antitrust Agenda Against Big Tech

Facebook upholding its ban on Donald Trump is a dangerous and reckless decision and sends a clear signal to conservatives using social media—you’re not welcome here. 
If Facebook is so big it thinks it can silence the leaders you elect, it’s time for conservatives to pursue an antitrust agenda against Big Tech. Click here to learn more.

ATF Nominee Chipman Would Threaten Gun Ownership

I led a letter with over 68 Republican cosigners calling on the Senate to block the nomination of David Chipman to ATF. 
Chipman is squirrelly, dishonest and a far left activist, who should stay far way from Hoosiers’ 2nd amendment rights! Click here to learn more. 
Fighting Against Biden's Radical Tax Proposals

To pay for his $4 trillion “infrastructure plan,” President Biden has proposed trillions in tax increases.
Two of his proposals are particularly bad—repealing stepped-up basis from the tax code and requiring payment of capital gains taxes at death. Together they would reduce wages by $32 for every $100 in taxes collected and eliminate 80,000 jobs per year. 
This tax plan will devastate small businesses and farms and place an administrative and financial burden on families who’ve lost a loved one. 
This week, I joined over 130 of my colleagues in a letter to Speaker Pelosi highlighting the dangers of using these proposals as a way to pay for President Biden's reckless spending packages. Click here to read the letter.  
Introducing the Student Loan Disclosure Modernization Act

Last week, I joined Rep. Emanuel Cleaver, II (D-MO) in re-introducing the Student Loan Disclosure Modernization Act. This bill would ensure student borrowers have a clearer understanding of terms and conditions before signing a loan agreement. Specifically, the bipartisan legislation would simplify the Department of Education’s Plain Language Disclosure Form to place a greater emphasis on material terms of the loan. 
Young students often just out of high school are expected to make financial decisions that will affect them for decades, and they deserve a simple explanation of their obligations when they do. Click here to learn more.

Stop Forcing Our Kids to Wear Masks!

Atop NIAID expert is coming AGAINST Dr. Fauci: ""Requiring kids to continuously wear masks at camps, even while outside playing in the heat, when it provides little additional protection is unfair and cruel to our children.” 
The data is clear: Young kids are extremely unlikely to suffer serious complications from COVID-19 and children under 9 have only accounted 5% of transmissions. 
Now that there's a widely available vaccine for those that want it, enough is enough: Stop forcing our kids to wear masks! Click here to learn more.

5/28/21 14:47,American Rescue Plan: More than $294 Million in Pandemic Recovery Funds Heading to the District,"News from Congressman Lawson

 




 
 


More than $294 Million in Pandemic Recovery Funds Heading to the District
Dear Neighbor: 
The health and economic impacts of COVID-19 have devastated our communities. Continuing budget shortfalls are putting countless teachers, first responders and other essential worker’s jobs in jeopardy. But more help is on its way. Through the American Rescue Act, our district is receiving $294,969,470 in federal COVID-19 recovery funds.   The Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds program will provide substantial flexibility for each jurisdiction to meet local needs – including support for households, small businesses, impacted industries, essential workers, and the communities hardest-hit by the crisis.  Funds for Florida’s Fifth Congressional District: 
	•	Baker County: $5,673,700
	•	Columbia County: $13,924,165
	•	Duval County: $186,032,681
	•	Gadsden County: $8,868,920
	•	Hamilton County: $2,802,470
	•	Jefferson County: $2,767,118
	•	Madison County: $3,592,048
	•	Leon County: $71,308,368
Additionally, we are continuously working to vaccinate as many people as possible, provide direct assistance to everyday Floridians, ensure businesses can reopen, and lay the foundation to revive the economy and create prosperity and opportunity for all.  The CDC reports 129 million adults have received either two shots of Pfizer or Moderna’s vaccine or one shot of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine, representing roughly 50 percent of the country’s 18-and-over population. These numbers prove we are heading in the right direction, and if we continue this path and follow science, COVID-19 will be in our rearview mirrors.    Despite no Florida Republicans – U.S. House or Senate – voting in favor of the American Rescue Plan, Florida residents, businesses, frontline workers, schools, and first responders are seeing huge benefits from the package. The American Rescue Plan funds will give teachers, police officers, nurses, firefighters, correctional officers, and emergency medical technicians $1,000 bonuses. Our frontline heroes are owed a debt of gratitude for their work throughout the pandemic. Additionally, through the American Rescue Plan, a stunning 93.5% of children in our district will benefit from the expanded and improved Child Tax Credit.   I pledged real relief to the people and small businesses who need it most, and I believe our work is making good on that promise. 
Please remember that my office is always here to help if you need assistance. I encourage you to sign up for my newsletter or follow me on Facebook and Twitter to stay abreast of the latest information. If you have or need assistance please, call my office at 904-354-1652 (Jacksonville), 850-558-9450 (Tallahassee) or (202) 225-0123 (Washington DC). You may also send questions or concerns through my website.      Stay Safe,      Al Lawson Member of Congress 
  
  
We Thank Our Service Members, Veterans, Military Families and Fallen Soldiers for Their Sacrifice    In this unprecedented time in American history, it is crucial that we rightfully recognize those servicemembers who have demonstrated the highest form of selflessness – sacrificing their lives for this great nation. This Memorial Day weekend, my staff and I plan to plant flags on the gravesites of our fallen heroes in Florida’s Fifth District. We are forever indebted to their bravery and courage, and that of their families. 

  HUD Inspection Act Will Hold Property Managers Accountable for Deplorable Living Conditions 
I worked with Rep. Alma Adams (NC-12), and Rep. Val Demings (FL-10) to re-introduce the HUD Inspection Act of 2021. This bill forces the U.S. Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) to take greater action when federal assisted housing properties fail to come into compliance with federal housing laws.   It is inexcusable that HUD inspectors are inaccurately passing units that display clear evidence of mold, rat infestations and sewage issues in federally assisted housing across the nation. No person should ever have to live under these horrific conditions, and these violations should receive immediate action.   Nationwide, more than 10 million people reside in HUD properties — 68 percent are seniors, children and persons with disabilities. Many units and facilities are often deemed unsafe, indecent, and in disrepair, but are ultimately passing HUD’s inspections.  
 The HUD Inspection Act of 2021 will: 
	•	Establish in law a requirement that HUD take action when properties score less than 60 on an inspection or fail to promptly address life threatening conditions; 
	•	Strengthen the compliance process by giving owners 15 days to respond to a notice of violation. If the problems persist, this bill directs HUD to develop a plan to bring the property into compliance within 45 days of the inspection;
	•	Require HUD to take additional enforcement action when a property continues to be in noncompliance;
	•	Authorize the HUD Secretary to impose financial penalties on owners that fail to maintain properties according to federal, physical standards or are repeatedly referred for remediation because of tenant surveys.   
Honored to Serve as an Assistant Whip for the 117th Congress 

It is a privilege to have the opportunity to create a lasting legislative impact for the residents of North Florida as an Assistant Whip for the 117th Congress. Assistant Whips coordinate with the Majority Whip to identify where Members of Congress are positioned on legislation. They serve as a resource for Members regarding upcoming bills.  In this position, we can further mold and improve the quality of life for all Americans and ensure an equitable future for generations to come. I am thankful for Whip James Clyburn’s leadership, and I am ready to work with my colleagues to move our nation forward.  During my time in Congress, I have championed critical legislation aimed to protect the environment, provide affordable health care for all, access to funding for small businesses, and access to mental health services for our nation's veterans. 
  
Emergency Broadband Benefit Program to Help Residents with Internet Access  

From virtual classrooms to telehealth visits, the pandemic has made access to reliable, high-speed internet more important than ever. That is why we recently launched the Emergency Broadband Benefit (EBB) Program. The internet is a necessity, not a luxury, and ensuring that every family has the ability to stay connected begins with ensuring every family can afford it.  I urge eligible residents to enroll to receive a discount on their monthly internet bill that will provide struggling families a discount of $50 off the monthly cost of home internet service. I will continue to work to expand internet access and improve affordability so that every household has reliable service.  Households interested in learning whether they qualify can visit the FCC’s new enrollment website – https://getemergencybroadband.org/. 
  
HELPER Act Creates a Process for First Responders and Educators to Affordably Purchase a Home 
Throughout the COVID-19 crisis the nation has leaned on the hard work and bravery of our first responders. I recently introduced the Homes for Every Local Protector, Educator, and Responder (HELPER) Act. This bipartisan legislation creates a new home loan assistance program that makes homeownership more accessible to first responders by eliminating certain costly barriers, such as down payments and monthly mortgage insurance premiums.   Many of our nation’s first responders and educators face financial obstacles when buying a home in today’s competitive housing market, and as a result, are often unable to achieve homeownership in the same communities they serve. The HELPER Act addresses this by establishing a new home loan program under the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) that creates a process for first responders and educators to affordably purchase a home.   
Specifically, the HELPER Act: 
	•	Creates a one-time use home loan program for law enforcement officers, firefighters, Emergency Medical Technicians (EMT), paramedics, and pre-K-12 teachers;  
	•	Eliminates a down payment requirement;
	•	Eliminates a monthly mortgage insurance premium (MIP) requirement;  
	•	Requires a 3.6 percent upfront mortgage insurance (UFMI) premium to ensure the solvency of the program; and  
	•	Requires the program to be reauthorized after five years.
  
  
Funding Available for Restaurants Impacted by Pandemic 

The Small Business Administration is accepting applications for its $28.6 billion restaurant relief program to help local restaurants, bars and other qualifying businesses impacted by COVID-19. The Restaurant Revitalization Fund was part of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. Business owners can use the funding to assist with payroll, rent/mortgage, utilities, maintenance, protective equipment food and beverage expenses, and more.   The program will provide restaurants with funding equal to their pandemic-related revenue loss up to $10 million per business and no more than $5 million per physical location. Recipients are not required to repay the funding as long as funds are used for eligible uses no later than March 11, 2023.  Eligible Grant Recipients include Restaurants, food stands, trucks, or carts; caterers; bars or lounges; saloons, inns, or taverns; brewpubs, tasting rooms, taprooms, or other licensed facilities or premises of a beverage alcohol producer where the public may taste, sample, or purchase products; and similar businesses where patrons assemble for the primary purpose of being served food or drink.  Restaurant owners can visit www.SBA.gov/restaurants for more information.  
  
Food Insecurity on College Campuses Need to Be Addressed 

  
Food insecurity is a real concern for many college students across our Florida’s Fifth District, and the pandemic has further elevated this problem. We can't have students forced to make hard choices between paying for food over books, transportation or other necessities. That is why I joined U.S. Representatives Jahana Hayes (D-Conn.) and Norma Torres (D-Calif.), and Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), and Bernard Sanders (I-Vt.) to introduce the Student Food Security Act of 2021.   This bicameral legislation will address food insecurity on college campuses by enabling more low-income college students to access the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and pushing the federal government, states, and colleges and universities to take a more proactive role in addressing student food insecurity.   A 2018 Government Accountability Office report, revealed that more than 30 percent of college students may face food insecurity and that almost 60 percent of potentially eligible students were not receiving SNAP benefits.   The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 temporarily expanded access to SNAP for college students during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Student Food Security Act would make that expansion permanent and provide other supports for students' basic needs, including a new grant program to help colleges and universities support their students. 
  
  
USDA Socially Disadvantaged Producer Debt Relief Program  
This week, I participated in the USDA Socially Disadvantaged Producer outreach meeting held at Florida A&M University Research & Extension Center in Quincy to discuss

how the American Rescue Plan is benefitting our minority farmers across North Florida. As a Member of the House Agriculture Committee, I am always pushing to bring resources to our area, particularly in our rural communities.  The American Rescue Plan includes two provisions to provide needed relief to Black, Indigenous, and Farmers of Color. First, the bill provides $4 billion in debt relief for certain USDA farm loans. Second, $1 billion is allocated to allow the Secretary of Agriculture to provide training, technical assistance and other assistance to black farmers and other farmers of color, as well as community-based organizations and the 1890 and 1994 Land Grants and other minority serving institutions.

 The pandemic has not affected all farmers the same. Due to longstanding discriminatory practices by the USDA, farmers of color have not had equal access to credit and other USDA safety net programs and are at risk of losing their farm due to the pandemic. Data from USDA shows a disproportionate percentage of the $50 billion in federal payments to agricultural producers to offset the effects of COVID-19 and the trade war went to non-minority farmers.
Debt relief in the ARP agriculture section is only for USDA direct and guaranteed farm loan debts as of January 1, 2021. It does not address “non-Federal” debt unless it is an FSA guaranteed loan with a commercial bank or Farm Credit System institution.  The debt relief program for farmers of color will increase the market share of the agricultural products that are purchased from our Black farmers and other socially disadvantaged farmers, and will give tax credits to those private companies who buy products from socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers. For more information on agricultural provision in the American Rescue Plan, please visit the USDA’s website.   
  
Farm Share Serves A Lifeline to Many in Florida's Fifth District 
My offices recently hosted Farm Shares in Jacksonville and Tallahassee to help families in need. I have enjoyed a working relationship with Farm Share for several years. Thank you to the many community volunteers who assist with each event. 

  In Florida, we have one of the most neglected Districts in the state. Six of the nine counties with the highest rates of food insecurity in Florida fall in Florida’s 5th (Gadsden, Leon, Jefferson, Madison, Hamilton and Duval). Each of these counties are very different in their make-up, but they are united by the unfortunate reality of hunger.  Now is the time to change that. We must continue to work together to alleviate hunger in North Florida and throughout our nation.

In the News: Georgia secretary of state joins GOP push to end no-excuse absentee voting
 
 
Fox News: 

""Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger joined fellow Republicans Wednesday in calling for an end to allowing all voters in the state to submit absentee ballots without providing justification for why they cannot vote in person.

Many states instituted ""no-excuse"" absentee voting in 2020 so that voters could avoid crowds at polling sites during the coronavirus pandemic, although Georgia has had it for 15 years. After the high voter turnout and tumultuous aftermath of the 2020 election, Raffensperger endorsed eliminating the practice during a Georgia House hearing.""

Fox News: 

""As the coronavirus pandemic swept the nation this spring, state and local governments were tasked with devising restrictions and regulations to help protect their residents as scientists worked tirelessly to create a vaccine. 

Stuck between a rock and a hard place, some governors like Georgia's Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and South Dakota's Gov. Kristi Noem chose to keep their economies open while risking transmission. Others took a hard-line stance at the expense of their economies but at the recommendation of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), shutting down small businesses, restaurants, public beaches and schools in an effort to fend off the disease.""

PROTECTING HOOSIER FAMILY FARMS

Hoosier family farmers are the backbone of our economy, and they work hard to put fresh food on our tables.
They shouldn’t have to make the difficult decision to sell or break up their farm because of a crushing tax bill after the death of a loved one. 
That’s why I introduced legislation to protect family-owned farmland by assessing estate taxes on the actual value of their businesses, which they often have spent decades cultivating.

The bipartisan Preserving Family Farms Act would update existing provisions in the tax code to ensure estate taxes are based on the value of farmland as it is actually used, not its highest potential value if it was sold for development. 
This commonsense, bipartisan bill would give the next generation of farmers a better chance to carry on their family’s legacy and keep family-owned agricultural businesses going strong.
Agriculture plays a central role in growing our economy and strengthening our communities in Indiana. I’ll continue fighting for Hoosier family farmers and working with my colleagues to advance this bill.
OVER 1 MILLION HOOSIERS VACCINATED

National Public Health Week is coming to a close and it’s a great opportunity to thank all the public health workers who are doing everything they can to help our community defeat this invisible enemy.
Our health care heroes are taking care of patients and getting shots into arms – with more than 1 million Hoosiers now fully vaccinated.
These vaccines are safe and effective, and they’re key to rebuilding our economy and getting life back to normal. I encourage all Hoosiers to sign up to get your shot, or talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have questions or concerns.
You can sign up online at OurShot.in.gov or by calling 2-1-1.
Last week I got to see our frontline health care providers hard at work across our community.

I visited HealthLinc in Mishawaka, a community heath center reaching vulnerable Hoosiers, underserved populations, and those who are disproportionately affected by COVID.

I also stopped at the VA clinic in Mishawaka to see where they have been holding mass vaccination events to reach hundreds of veterans in just one day.

Finally, hospitals and health care providers like Saint Joseph Health System are also administering vaccines while continuing to treat Hoosiers with COVID and other medical challenges. I got to hear from the health care workers there who have been on the front lines for over a year.
TAX DAY EXTENDED

Attention Hoosier taxpayers: The IRS extended the federal income tax filing due date for individuals, including those who pay self-employment tax, for the 2020 tax year to May 17th. 
This extension applies to all taxpayers without penalties and interest, regardless of the amount owed. 
Taxpayers who are due a refund should file as soon as possible. The quickest way to get refunds is to file electronically with direct deposit. E-filing can also help some taxpayers get any remaining stimulus payments more quickly.
For more tips on how to file your taxes quickly and take the stress out of this year’s filing season, click here.
If you need additional time to file beyond the May 17th deadline, you can request a filing extension until October 15th by filing Form 4868 through your tax professional, tax software, or the Free File link on IRS.gov. However, this does not grant an extension of time to pay taxes due. Taxpayers should pay their federal income tax due by May 17th, 2021, to avoid interest and penalties.
As always, it is a privilege to represent 2nd District Hoosiers in Congress.

Coronavirus Updates and Resources from Rep. Lieu
Dear neighbor,  
We are now in our third and most severe wave of this pandemic. As of December 3, Los Angeles County has its highest daily number of COVID-19 hospitalizations at 2,572 individuals. Since early November, the average number of daily cases has increased by 225% and the case positivity rate has risen dramatically from 3.9% on November 1 to 13.0% on December 2. These numbers are alarming and can only be turned around if each and every one of us does our part to stop the spread. This means washing our hands frequently; engaging in physical distancing; wearing a face covering in public; and following public health guidelines.    Below you will find information on the latest state and local safety measures. I understand these restrictions are taking a great toll on all of us, especially on our local CA-33 businesses.   Despite the obstacles we face, I am confident in our ability to meet this challenge together. I know it isn’t easy, but your continued efforts to protect the health of our community are deeply appreciated.   
Your Weekly Reminder: 
	1.	This is a difficult and uncertain period for all of us, when many are feeling stressed, anxious or depressed. If you are feeling this way, please know that you are not alone. If you need someone to talk to, please call the LA County Department of Mental Health hotline at (800) 854-7771 or text “LA” to 741741. Please also view the CDC’s guidance for coping with stress and anxiety during a pandemic.   
	2.	In the middle of a pandemic, ensuring Californians have access to quality, affordable health care options is more important than ever. Californians can sign up for health care coverage now through Covered California’s open enrollment period. Consumers who shop health care plans during this time will benefit from California’s lowest rate change of 0.5% for 2021. To learn more and shop and compare plans, please visit coveredca.com.  
	3.	Please remember to get your flu shot to stay healthy this season. It is likely that both COVID-19 and the flu will be present at the same time in LA County this year. You can get a flu shot at any local pharmacy. For quick flu facts and frequently asked questions about COVID-19 and the flu, click here.   
	4.	Los Angeles County and its partner, Healthvana, have created a new contact tracing system to empower those who’ve tested positive for COVID-19 to anonymously notify their close contacts. Since April, Healthvana has delivered test results to those tested at county-operated sites via text or email. With this new system, messages alerting patients of a positive test result will include a link that allows individuals to enter the contact information of any recent close contacts so they can be notified of their potential exposure. Another way to support contact tracing in LA County is by downloading SafePass, a mobile app to help contain the spread of COVID-19. For more on contact tracing in LA County, please click here.  
	5.	Have you witnessed fraud, waste, or abuse of coronavirus pandemic relief funds? Congress has approved over $3 trillion in federal spending to combat the pandemic and I am committed to ensuring your tax dollars are being spent properly. I encourage you to visit coronavirus.house.gov/contact/tip-line or call 202-225-4400 today to report waste, fraud, or abuse of COVID-19 funds. 
COVID-19 Updates
As cases surge across our state and county, many of the COVID-19 restrictions currently in place are subject to change within the next few days. I want to provide you with the relevant resources so you can stay up to date on the latest developments. For recent coronavirus updates from the state of California, including details about the new Regional Stay at Home Order, please visit covid19.ca.gov. For updates from Los Angeles County, please visit covid19.lacounty.gov.   The LA County Department of Public Health is encouraging all residents to stay home as much as possible in the coming weeks to flatten the curve and save lives. Please remember to stay home; reduce mingling with those outside of your household; and wear a face covering outside of your home. 
Additional Information 
	1.	All LA County residents who would like to get tested should first contact their Primary Care Provider to see if they offer COVID-19 tests. If you cannot access a test through your provider, LA County is offering free testing. Please get tested if you: 
	◦	Have symptoms related to COVID-19.
	◦	Were asked to get tested by LA Public Health because of a contact tracing investigation.
	◦	Were in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19 in the past two weeks.
	◦	Work or live in a skilled nursing facility; group home; residential care facility; homeless shelter; or correctional facility.
	◦	Are experiencing homelessness.
	◦	Are an essential worker with frequent contact with the public.
	◦	Don’t have symptoms but believe you may have been exposed to COVID-19.   
	2.	Today, LA County launched free and FDA-approved at-home COVID testing. For more information, please click here.  
	3.	  
	4.	If you live in the City of LA and are unable to drive to a testing site, you can receive a free COVID-19 test at a mobile pop-up location (no appointment necessary). Please click here to view current and upcoming pop-up testing sites.  
	5.	For updated data on COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in California and LA County, please go to update.covid19.ca.gov and publichealth.lacounty.gov.   
	6.	If your small business has been affected by the pandemic, you may be eligible for federal tax credits. To learn more, please click here.    
	7.	  
	8.	Last week, Mayor Garcetti announced that all travelers entering the City of Los Angeles from another state or city will be required to fill out an online form to ensure acknowledgement of California’s 14-day quarantine period and the state’s new travel advisory. All passengers arriving at LAX or Van Nuys Airport must fill out the form at travel.lacity.org before or upon arrival. LAX is also now offering contactless food ordering and pick-up via LAXOrderNow.com.  
	9.	This week was United Against Hate Week, when we recommit to standing up against hate together. If you or someone you know has experienced a hate incident, please call 2-1-1 to report it.  
	10.	If you are in need of childcare services due to the pandemic, please visit mychildcare.ca.gov to find information on licensed childcare providers near you.   
	11.	If you are looking for a new job or want to build job skills, the LA County Library has established a Work Ready program for you. To sign up, please click here.  
	12.	Governor Newsom announced additional financial assistance for California businesses struggling as a result of the pandemic. The state will provide temporary tax relief for eligible businesses and, in partnership with the Legislature, $500 million in COVID-19 Relief Grant funding for small businesses. It will also increase funding for the California Rebuilding Fund by $12.5 million. These measures will be crucial to supporting vulnerable California small businesses, which are the foundation of the state’s economy. To learn more about the new assistance, please click here.  
	13.	Johnson & Johnson has launched its Phase 3 ENSEMBLE trial to evaluate the efficacy (whether it works) and safety of Janssen’s investigational vaccine for the prevention of COVID-19. The ENSEMBLE trial aims to recruit up to 60,000 participants and is being conducted with the highest scientific and ethical standards. It is essential to include all types of people in clinical trials when researching and developing new vaccines in order to help ensure they are safe and effective for those disproportionately impacted. To learn more about Johnson & Johnson’s ENSEMBLE trial and determine if you are eligible to participate in the study, visit www.ensemblestudy.com. A clinical trial site near CA-33 is located at Anthony Mills, MD, Inc. at 9201 W Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles.  
	14.	On December 3rd, Los Angeles County launched the Keep LA County Dining Grant Program to help restaurants impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. The program will provide $30,000 for eligible businesses to use for employee payroll, outstanding expenses, adaptive business practices to be able to stay open, and more. Preference will be given to restaurants that offered outdoor dining as of November 24th, 2020. Businesses that have already received assistance through LA County CARES Act programs are not eligible for this program. For additional information, please visit keeplacountydining.lacda.org.* The application period opened on Thursday, December 3rd and will extend through Sunday, December 6th at 11:59 p.m.  
	15.	  *Please note: Due to technical issues, the Keep LA County Dining website is temporarily down. The LA County Development Authority is working to resolve the issue. Please check here for updates.   
	16.	If you are unable to pay your rent due to financial strain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, please visit housingiskey.com for tenant rights, a rent relief guide and more.   
	17.	  
	18.	Through the COVID-19 Safety Compliance Certification Program, businesses owners can become trained on required safety protocols at no cost. Once they finish the program, they will receive a certificate and window seal to display at their establishment to reassure customers and employees that safety is their top priority. To learn more and become certified, please click here.   
	19.	If you volunteer or are an organization looking to recruit volunteers, please view this guidance on volunteer safety. For information on how to get involved, visit californiavolunteers.ca.gov.    
	20.	This week, Los Angeles County launched the Community Equity Fund to help prevent COVID-19 transmission in communities disproportionately impacted by the virus. Through this initiative, LA County seeks to address the inequities in COVID-19 prevention measures in some of the hardest-hit areas by partnering with 51 community-based organizations (CBOs) on the ground and providing them with funding, training, and technical assistance. To learn more about the Community Equity Fund, please click here.  
	21.	LA City Mayor Garcetti recently announced emergency relief for food-service workers who have suffered a financial blow due to COVID-19 restrictions. The Secure Emergency Relief for Vulnerable Employees (SERVE) initiative will provide 4,000 local food-service workers with a one-time $800 stipend. Please click here to determine if you are eligible.  
	22.	Mayor Garcetti also announced a new program to help deliver internet access to young students who need it the most. The Angeleno Connectivity Trust (ACT) will offer 100 GB of free internet connectivity to vulnerable students, including those in foster care, experiencing homelessness, and youth with disabilities. To find more information on ACT, please go to lamayor.org/Connectivity.    
	23.	If you or someone you know needs food, please visit covid19.lacounty.gov/food or call 2-1-1.  
	24.	The World Health Organization (WHO) issued new mask guidelines, urging people who live in areas where coronavirus is spreading to wear a face covering at all times in public spaces. To download and read through the new guidelines, please click here.    
	25.	  
	26.	Although we continue to face challenges brought on by this pandemic, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Yesterday, Governor Newsom unveiled the first details of the state’s vaccine distribution plan. The first batch of vaccines will be distributed to health care workers in both clinical and non-clinical settings. To learn more about vaccine distribution, please click here. 
With coronavirus cases rising in our area, we are all counting on each other to take the necessary precautions this holiday season. By washing our hands frequently, engaging in physical distancing, and wearing a mask in public, we are each playing our part in protecting our community. For more information on the coronavirus, please visit my coronavirus webpage, covid19.ca.gov and/or covid19.lacounty.gov. For frequent updates, please follow me on my Facebook, Instagram and Twitter accounts. Remember – by staying home, you are saving lives. I look forward to updating you again soon. 
Stay safe.   Sincerely,   Ted W. Lieu  Member of Congress

In addition to the $47 billion in COVID-19 relief I have delivered for Georgia this year, with President Trump’s signature, another $900 billion is on the way to small businesses and families across the country. This includes $284 billion for small businesses, a second round of stimulus checks, aid for farmers, funding for vaccine distribution and resources to help schools safely reopen.
That $900 billion COVID-19 relief package was combined with an appropriations bill that funds the government through September 2021. I am deeply concerned about the significant amount of wasteful spending in the portion funding the government, but ultimately supported the final package because it included the critical COVID-19 relief for Georgians and all Americans.  
Time and again, I called for a deal, and finally, after months of delay and obstruction by Democrats, more help is on the way for millions of hardworking Georgians. You can read more here.
In addition to the direct stimulus checks, some other highlights of COVID-19 assistance include: 
	•	$284.5 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP);
	•	$82 billion in funding for schools and universities to assist with reopening for in-person learning that also includes $2.75 billion in designated funds for private K through 12 education;
	•	$25 billion in temporary, targeted rental assistance for individuals who lost their source of income during the pandemic;
	•	$22 billion to assist states with COVID-19 testing;
	•	$20 billion for vaccine development;
	•	$13 billion in supplementary assistance for farmers who incurred losses during the COVID-19 pandemic;
	•	$10 billion for grants to childcare centers to help providers safely reopen; and
	•	$8 billion for vaccine distribution
 
REQUESTING LENIENCY FOR GEORIGA COLLEGE STUDENT
Senator Perdue and I have written to the U.S. Embassy in Jamaica, on behalf of Skylar Mack, an 18-year-old college student from Georgia currently detained in the Cayman Islands, and her family to ensure her safe return home. Ms. Mack has already pleaded guilty of violating the COVID-19 quarantine regulations of the Cayman Islands and paid a substantial fine, but still faces a two-month imprisonment. While COVID-19 poses a significant threat, we support Ms. Mack’s request for leniency in this sentence.

December 4, 2020
Dear Friends,
 
I hope you and your family enjoyed a meaningful Thanksgiving and spent time reflecting on all for which we’re grateful.
 
We’re grateful for our frontline health care workers, first responders, and the scientific community who are leading our fight against COVID-19, our Veterans and families who selflessly serve and protect our Nation and values, and our grocery store employees, truck drivers, warehouse workers, teachers, farmers, mail carriers, restaurant owners, small business owners and all who tirelessly support and keep our communities running - especially with the challenges of this year. 
 

Operation Warp Speed (OWS)
 
We’re engaged in an unprecedented effort to develop and deliver a safe, effective COVID-19 vaccine – and our work is paying off. 
 
In the last month, three different vaccines were found to be safe and over 90 percent effective. Two of the vaccine candidates – produced by Moderna/National Institute of Health and Pfizer/BioNtech – will begin seeking Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) next week. In light of these announcements, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said last weekend that frontline healthcare workers and the most vulnerable Americans could begin receiving vaccines before Christmas. 
 
Thanks to President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed and American ingenuity, we’ve made record scientific progress. The development of a COVID-19 vaccine in less than a year is truly historic, and should be celebrated. 
 
Operation Warp Speed was launched by President Trump in May 2020, and is a tremendous public-private effort that aids in the development, manufacturing, and distribution of coronavirus vaccines and treatments. The goal of OWS is to produce and deliver 300 million doses of safe and effective vaccines, with the initial doses available by January 2021. Moderna received over $2 billion of OWS funding for the development of its vaccine candidate. While Pfizer did not accept OWS funding, it did enter into a purchase agreement with the U.S. Government to produce and distribute 100 million doses, with the option for the U.S. to acquire an additional 500 million doses. Thanks to the tremendous private-public partnership fostered by OWS, we’re on the brink of delivering a safe and effective vaccine to American communities. 
 

This Week in Washington
 
The House was back in session this week, and what did Speaker Pelosi schedule for Members to vote on? Legalizing marijuana and exotic animal legislation featured in the Netflix show “Tiger King.”
 While our communities continue to feel the impacts of COVID-19, Speaker Pelosi continued playing partisan politics and refused to vote on assistance for small businesses fighting to keep their doors open and individuals/families whose livelihoods have been decimated by the pandemic. Over 190 Members of Congress have called on the Speaker to vote on legislation to reopen the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for small businesses, and House Republicans made a Commitment to America and are ready to negotiate relief for the American People. The Speaker, however, is blocking this critical assistance and is disinterested in helping the American People. 
 
It's absolutely absurd that Speaker Pelosi prioritized marijuana legalization and TV drama over the health and well-being of Americans, and this shines a spotlight on House Democrats’ severely misguided and detrimental priorities.

12/28/20 18:57,COVID-19 Relief Package,"Dear Friend,  The House and Senate passed H.R. 133, the Omnibus Appropriations and Emergency Coronavirus Relief package on December 21. Last night, the president signed it into law.  Americans have had a difficult nine months and now face a tough winter. This legislation will deliver urgently needed relief over the next few months. It ensures that families can stay in their homes and unemployed workers will continue to receive additional support. It also provides a second round of PPP assistance for small businesses, funding for vaccine distribution, and direct cash payments.  I’m glad we were able to pass this critical piece of legislation and I will continue my efforts to support New Jersey with the next administration. However, there is still work to be done. The House voted on additional legislation today to expand the direct cash payments to $2,000 and I hope that Senate Majority Leader McConnell will act immediately to do the same.  We will also need to extend relief measures again and send direct aid to state and local governments that are facing revenue shortages resulting in layoffs and budget cuts while working on the ground to provide food assistance, testing sites, and small businesses grants. I will keep working to provide support to North Jersey residents so we can get to the other side of this crisis.  I wanted to share some of the key provisions in the legislation:  Support for Families: 
	•	Provides direct payments of $600 for individuals making up to $75,000, $1,200 for couples making up to $150,000, and $600 for each dependent child.  
	•	Extends Unemployment Insurance benefits through March 14, 2021, with an additional $300 per week.  
	•	Extends the CDC eviction moratorium through January 31, 2021.  
	•	Creates the first-ever emergency federal rental assistance program to be distributed by state and local governments.  
	•	$13 billion in increased SNAP and child nutrition benefits. 
Support for Small Businesses: 
	•	$284 billion for first and second forgivable PPP loans. 
	•	$20 billion in new EIDL grants for businesses in low-income communities. 
	•	$15 billion in dedicated funding for live venues, independent movie theaters, and cultural institutions. 
	•	Expands PPP eligibility for 501(c)(6) nonprofits. 
	•	Extends and improves the Employee Retention Tax Credit to help keep workers in their jobs and provides a tax credit to support employers offering paid sick leave. 
Support to Address the Public Health Crisis: 
	•	$20 billion for vaccine procurement and therapeutics.  
	•	$9 billion to the CDC and states for vaccine distribution. 
	•	$22 billion to states for testing, tracing, and mitigation programs.  
	•	$3 billion for the Strategic National Stockpile. 
	•	Ends surprise medical billing for emergency and scheduled care, establishing a fair process for health care providers and health plans to sort out the out-of-network costs between themselves, without the patient stuck in the middle. 
Support for Communities:
	•	$82 billion in funding for colleges and schools, including support for HVAC repair and replacement to mitigate virus transmission and reopen classrooms. 
	•	$10 billion for child care assistance to help get parents back to work and keep child care providers open. 
	•	$45 billion for transit, including $1 billion for Amtrak. 
	•	$7 billion to increase access to broadband, including a new Emergency Broadband Benefit to help millions of students, families, and unemployed workers afford the broadband they need during the pandemic. 
	•	Extends the eligibility of state and local expenses under the CARES Act Coronavirus Relief Fund until December 31, 2021, so state and local governments can continue to provide services to residents during the pandemic with funding they received from the CARES Act. 
My office will continue to provide you updates on programs and other announcements as we receive them. We expect that the Treasury Department will start issuing checks shortly. Our four counties are all developing plans for vaccine distribution. To stay informed, I encourage you to sign up for my newsletter and forward this message to your neighbors who you think would also like to receive this information from my team.  Please don’t hesitate to reach out to my office with any issues you are having related to federal programs. You can email nj11casework@mail.house.gov or fill out a casework form here on my website.  Sincerely,

Mikie Sherrill
   
 
I'm incredibly honored to serve the 11th District and will continue to work hard on the issues that will move New Jersey, and this country, forward.

4/5/21 15:02,Mario's Message,"April 5, 2021
Dear friend,

Welcome back to another edition of Mario’s Message. Here are the latest updates on all things happening in Washington and Florida’s 25th Congressional District. It is my absolute honor to serve you, and I encourage you to get in touch with my office if we can ever be of assistance. 

William “Billy” Evans


Last Friday, Capitol Police Officer William “Billy” Evans paid the ultimate price while protecting our nation’s Capitol. Officer Evans had served in the Capitol Complex for 18 years. He responded quickly and bravely to a senseless attack, and his heroism helped save many lives that day. I’m grateful to U.S. Capitol Police, as well as all other law enforcement officers who risk it all each and every day to keep us safe.

Diaz-Balart and McCaul in WSJ: Appeasing Cuba’s Regime Didn’t Work


Wall Street Journal

April 2, 2021

For more than 60 years, a dictatorship has imposed a violently oppressive system on the Cuban people. Its human-rights abuses grew worse under the appeasement policy of the Obama-Biden administration. Amid the “thaw” in relations, documented political detentions rose to 9,940 in 2016 from 8,616 in 2015. The Castro regime lined its pockets and expanded its machinery of repression. 

The malignancy has spread beyond the island. After revamping the Venezuelan military and intelligence services, Cuba led efforts to sustain the illegitimate Nicolás Maduro regime and supported its abuses, which mirrored those carried out against the Cuban people. The 2020 State Department report on Venezuela highlights torture, arbitrary detentions and extrajudicial killings—abuses that “amounted to crimes against humanity,” U.N.-appointed investigators found. 

…

The Cuban regime alone bears responsibility for U.S. sanctions. Under the 1996 Libertad Act, sanctions will end if the U.S. president certifies that a genuine democratic transition in Cuba is under way. The basic conditions include the release of all political prisoners; legalization of independent media, political parties and trade organizations; and free, fair multiparty elections. Until then, the U.S. must demonstrate solidarity with the Cuban people, which includes tough sanctions on their oppressors. We urge President Biden to uphold the sanctions imposed by the Libertad Act, legislation he voted for years ago, rather than resume the policy of appeasement.

COVID-19 Resources


Immokalee Business Community Meeting



Rural small businesses play a key role in local economies and communities, and we must do all we can to ensure they’re equipped with the resources to thrive. It was a pleasure to meet with the Immokalee Chamber of Commerce and the Immokalee business community to discuss how COVID-19 has affected small businesses in the area and what Congress can do to continue to help the American people.

Visit our website
Media
A Doctor's Note
Last week, I was able to travel back to the great state of Kansas to meet with constituents and hold town halls in Grant County, Stanton County, Stevens County, Morton County, and Hamilton County. I toured the Garden City Regional Airport, visited multiple food processing facilities, and participated in a local preschool’s educational farm day program. Most importantly, I got to have real conversations with fellow Kansans about their ideas and about the issues impacting their lives.  Additionally, this past week I delivered my maiden speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate highlighting the Kansas values that I was raised on. It is those values that are laying the foundation for my work in the U.S. Senate. As I traveled Kansas this past year, I carried the values with me while I heard from people all over the state as they gave me three very clear priorities:       1) To provide for their safety, health, and security;       2) To bring our jobs and economy back; and       3) To protect our values and our God-given, inalienable rights.  I’m here in this Senate to do just that. To fight for the people of Kansas, for all Americans, but more than anyone else, I’m here to fight for our children and grandchildren. Like another Kansan, the 34th President of the United States, Dwight David Eisenhower, the decisions I make will be most guided by the impact they will have upon future generations.  I'm honored to serve as your voice in Washington, D.C. My family and I take this responsibility seriously and we are proud to represent all Kansans in the U.S. Senate. Please do not hesitate to reach out to me on my website: https://www.marshall.senate.gov/.  Sincerely, 

Maiden Speech: My Kansas Values and Priorities in the U.S. Senate  
As I mentioned earlier, this past Wednesday, I had the honor of taking part in a long standing tradition of the U.S. Senate to deliver my maiden speech. I started my speech by highlighting my upbringing and the Kansas values that will help lay the foundation for my priorities. These values provided the foundation for me – a fifth generation farm kid – to become a first generation college student, and live my American dream as a physician in rural America. And these values have become pillars, the sturdiest of which in my life are faith, family, community, education and hard work: 

	•	A FAITH that you live in your heart, not wear on your shirt sleeve;
	•	A FAMILY that loves and stands beside you no matter what;
	•	A COMMUNITY where everyone looks out for each other;
	•	An EDUCATION that is the great equalizer leveling the playing field for all.
	•	And finally, a belief in HARD WORK that paves the way to achieve your American dream.

President Biden Must Respect Private Property Rights of Farmers and Ranchers   Last week, I sent a letter to President Biden asking him to reconsider his directive to conserve at least 30% of our private lands and waters by 2030 commonly known as 30 by 30. Farmers and ranchers will be a main target of this initiative, and these private landowners deserve an equitable and meaningful voice moving forward. America’s farmers and ranchers must continue to have authority over what occurs on their property and have the freedom to produce an abundance of food, fuel, and fiber to feed the growing world population. Click HERE for more information on how I’m fighting to protect private property rights.  Democrats’ Mission to Pack the Supreme Court Will Alter the Very Fabric of our Republic   Over the past several days, Democrats have moved forward with another blatant power grab, expanding the U.S. Supreme Court to make room for activist judges willing to legislate from the bench. The radical legislation the Democrats have introduced will alter the very fabric of our Republic – all in the name of political greed and power. The Supreme Court is specifically designed to be an impartial check to Congress, yet now, Democrats have made it clear that they want the Supreme Court to be a political body of activist, liberal judges. The shameless hypocrisy of this stunt is unmistakable. Many Democrats and even President Biden himself have been outspoken against court packing in the past. You can watch a few of my interviews on this topic by clicking on the images below. 


Bill Lowering Prescription Drug Costs Heading to President’s Desk   A piece of legislation I introduced that lowers prescription drug costs is heading to the President’s desk to be signed into law. As a physician, and now a U.S. Senator, I’m confident that innovation and competition can have a profound impact on driving down the cost of health care. Sadly, the current regulatory landscape unnecessarily delays patients from gaining access to FDA-approved generics. This piece of bipartisan legislation ensures affordable life-saving medicine while preserving innovation for cutting-edge medicine. I’m proud to be a part of it, and I look forward to the positive impact it will have on the lives of the American people once it is signed into law. Click HERE for more information on this piece of legislation.   ‘Meatless Mondays’ at Government Agencies? No Way.   The last thing Americans need is big government stepping in and telling them what they are allowed to eat. I’m proud to be fighting against the Left’s “War on Meat” and “Meatless Mondays” with new legislation I introduced with Senator Ernst. The TASTEE Act – or the Telling Agencies to Stop Tweaking What Employees Eat Act of 2021 – would prohibit federal agencies from establishing policies that ban serving meat for employees. In 2012, the Obama-Biden USDA infamously sent out an agency newsletter that would serve as a catalyst for instituting the “Meatless Monday” initiative at USDA. The TASTEE Act, ensures federal agencies can’t ban meat and other agriculture products in government dining halls at the expense of America’s hardworking farmers and producers. The Biden Administration should not have the right to make radical political statements at the expense of federal employees’ dietary options and America’s hardworking farmers and livestock producers. This piece of legislation prevents that from happening, and I will continue fighting for Kansas farmers and ranchers, as well as our freedoms as Americans in any way I can. More information on the TASTEE Act can be found HERE.   Investigation into Planned Parenthood Affiliates’ Unlawful PPP Participation   Last week, I joined my colleagues in sending letters to the U.S. Attorney General and leaders of the Small Business Administration requesting an immediate investigation into Planned Parenthood Affiliates’ unlawful participation in the Paycheck Protection Program. These affiliates of Planned Parenthood wrongfully applied for federal loans and received tens of millions of dollars of federal assistance. They have yet to return the money. The Paycheck Protection Program was created to provide struggling small businesses with much needed federal assistance, not provide booming abortion mills with extra cash on hand. The SBA’s failure to reclaim the unlawful disbursement of taxpayer funds to Planned Parenthood affiliates is unacceptable. I will continue to fight to prevent Kansans’ hard earned tax dollars from funding abortions, while the Biden Administration repeatedly ignores the American people’s moral repulsion to abortions and insists on providing financial support.

 ICE Deportations Now at the Lowest Monthly Level on Record
CBP apprehensions are still at a 20-year high while ICE deportations are the lowest ever on record. Does this make any sense?

This administration would rather release dangerous, unvetted, and untested illegal aliens into our communities than send them home.

Democrats See the Border Crisis as Their Future
Biden's Border Crisis is a political fight for the Democrats because they see this as their future.

More illegal aliens = more Democrat voters.

Power should never be prioritized over your health and safety.

Biden Caves to the Radical Left Again
The only thing Biden’s consistent on is caving to the radical Left and putting our safety last.

Inviting in tens of thousands of unvetted refugees – including those from terrorist hotbeds – is insanely irresponsible and will lead to another crisis.

Biden's Spending Should Concern You
In just 100 days, Biden has proposed $6 trillion in new spending to pile on top of our already $28 trillion-plus national debt.

Like Sen. Manchin, this reckless spending should deeply concern you – especially since you, your kids, and grandkids will be paying for it for years to come.

VP Harris Blames the Climate for Creating the Border Crisis
Joe Biden’s rhetoric and policies are the “root causes” of the border crisis – FULL STOP.

Gun Control Does Not Work
Chicago has some of the strictest gun laws in the entire country, yet it's riddled with violent crime.

Clearly, gun control does not work.

This city needs a new strategy: enforce the laws already in place, support law enforcement, and invest in new leadership.

Congratulating the 2021 Congressional Art Competition Winner 
On Thursday, I hosted a ceremony at Hardin-Jefferson ISD to recognize the participants and announce the winner of the 2021 Congressional Art Competition. This year's competition followed the theme of “TX-36 the Energy Capital of the World.” First place was awarded to Josye Meteer, a junior at Hardin-Jefferson, for her artwork ""Oil Cars in the Early Morning,"" which will now be displayed in the U.S. Capitol for an entire year.

I'd like to congratulate Josye Meteer and thank each of the talented students who participated in this year’s Congressional Art Competition, as well as the art teachers and families who supported them throughout this process. Since the discovery of Spindletop in 1901, the area encompassing much of Texas’ 36th Congressional District has been the epicenter of the nation’s energy sector. We have so many great artists in TX-36, and I'm extremely proud to show off their work to visitors from both our district and different parts of the country as they pass by the display in the U.S. Capitol.

 Recognizing the 76th Anniversary of V-E Day
 Yesterday marked 76 years since the Allies formally accepted Nazi Germany’s unconditional surrender – marking the end of WWII in Europe. May 8, 1945 – dubbed “Victory in Europe Day” or “V-E Day” – was a joyous occasion but not the end of the war.

America and its allies immediately turned their attention towards the war against Japan in the Pacific – a struggle that would continue for nearly four more months. I am proud and extremely honored to have known many of these heroes, who as young men left their homes and families to take up the fight against tyranny. They are truly our nation’s finest generation of men and women, and they’ve forever earned our heartfelt appreciation.

 A Proud Grandpa

I hope you are doing well and staying healthy and safe! I am heartened to see the American Rescue Plan working to put shots in arms and more money in pockets, and provide needed emergency aid to our students, schools and small business owners. 
 
Over 150 million Americans have been vaccinated since January, and everyone cheered CDC’s guidance yesterday that people who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 do not need to wear masks or practice social distancing indoors or outdoors, except under certain circumstances. President Biden called it a great day for America, and I am grateful for his leadership on vaccine distribution. We still have a long way to go, so please help your family and neighbors get vaccinated as soon as possible
  
 
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN AID FOR  
COLLEGE STUDENTS
 
  
This week, I announced more than $180 million in emergency funding for Hillsborough Community College, the University of South Florida, the University of Tampa and students provided under the American Rescue Plan to help them cope with the severe financial fallout from COVID-19 pandemic. At least half of the aid will be distributed as emergency cash assistance grants to students who are facing hunger, homelessness, and other hardships.
  
 
AID FINALLY HEADED TO HILLSBOROUGH SCHOOLS
 
  
Over five months after funds passed the Congress, some of the emergency aid allocated to Hillsborough County Public Schools (HCPS) was finally released by the state and is on the way to help our schools, teachers and students. Unfortunately, the state is still slow-walking a large portion of emergency funds that are due to HCPS. Together with parents, teachers and local leaders, I intend to keep a close eye on the state to ensure that the federal emergency aid is provided according to federal law and serves the purpose we intended: to support our students and educators immediately, ensure continuity of student learning, avoid layoffs and other detrimental consequences.

Even if you do not normally file a tax return, you should do so this year to ensure you receive tax credits. If you need help filing your taxes, United Way Suncoast is scheduling free appointments.

I testified in front of the Natural Resources Committee on “Protecting Coastal Communities and Ocean Resources from Offshore Drilling” where they considered my bipartisan Florida Coastal Protection Act to make permanent the moratorium on oil drilling off Florida’s coast that is slated to expire in 2022. 
  
 
VOTES THIS WEEK
 
  

H.R. 1065 – Pregnant Workers Fairness Act: This bipartisan legislation that I cosponsored would finally secure strong and clear protections for pregnant workers. No one should have to choose between their paycheck and a healthy pregnancy.
  

H.R. 49 – To designate the National Pulse Memorial located at 1912 South Orange Avenue, Orlando, Florida, 32806: I am proud to join my colleagues, led by Rep. Darren Soto, in calling for the establishment of the National Pulse Memorial to offer a sanctuary of hope & healing for Orlando & the broader LGBTQ community.
  

H.R. 958 – Protecting Moms Who Served Act: This bill I cosponsored would help women veterans by comprehensively studying the unique maternal health risks facing pregnant and postpartum veterans and by supporting VA maternity care coordination programs. It is also included in the Momnibus, a package of legislation crafted by the Black Maternal Health Caucus and would make critical investments in addressing social determinants of health, funding community-based organizations, growing and diversifying the perinatal workforce, and improving in data collection processes if passed.
  

H.R. 2547 – Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act: This legislation would regulate debt collectors and provide much-needed new relief to private student loan borrowers.

2/7/21 19:38,One Step Closer to COVID-19 Relief,"Friends,   When insurrectionists stormed our nation’s Capitol on January 6, it was heroic members of the Capitol Police force who fought to hold them back and protect all of us inside. And on that day, Officer Brian Sicknick, a proud South River, NJ native, gave his life courageously defending our democracy. On Wednesday morning, I joined his family, friends and hundreds of fellow officers to pay my respects as he laid in honor in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. Brian was truly selfless, brave and dedicated his life to serving and protecting our nation.

ONE: COVID-19 Relief
Early Friday morning, Democrats passed a budget resolution, an important step forward in delivering on President Biden’s American Rescue Plan. Our country is hurting and this big, bold relief plan is designed to meet the tremendous needs of the American people and rebuild our crippling economy. And we need to move quickly. We cannot afford to wait! The legislation will include a national vaccination program, direct payments to struggling families, funding for state and local governments to keep first responders, teachers, and public health workers on the job, and help for unemployed workers and ailing small businesses and restaurants in New Jersey. Please know I will not rest until this bill is on the President’s desk and help is on the way to you and your family. Read more about the budget resolution here. 
 

TWO: Student Debt Relief
President Biden has the authority to cancel student loan debt and he should use that authority now! Millions of young people throughout New Jersey and the nation were drowning under the weight of student loan debt long before the coronavirus reached our shores. And it’s only gotten worse as the economic crisis is making it harder and harder to make ends meet. This week, Senator Booker and I cosponsored a Senate resolution calling on President Biden to use his executive authority to cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt. It’s the right thing to do for our families and the smart thing to do for our economy. Learn more here. 
 

THREE: Chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
This week I officially became Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a role I do not take lightly after four years of failed leadership under the Trump Administration. We must rebuild demoralized institutions like the State Department, repair alliances around the world, and develop smarter strategies to compete with China, address Russian aggression, fight climate change, and counter ever-changing threats around the world. I pledge to you that as Chairman I will fight for American leadership abroad that reflects the values we hold dear at home, including democracy, freedom, human rights and the rule of law.
 
And one more thing!!  February is Black History Month, a time to celebrate and honor the contributions of Black Americans to our great nation. New Jersey and our communities are fortunate to have the leadership and inspiration of individuals such as Lieutenant Governor Sheila Oliver and Senator Cory Booker. 
Make sure to follow me on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook as I uplift the stories, voices and contributions of other Black New Jerseyans who have helped move our nation forward.   Sincerely,     Senator Bob Menendez

1/24/21 18:30,A New Day in America,"Friends,   I hope you and your families are staying healthy and safe. Here’s what I was up to this week in the Senate: 
 


ONE: A New Day in America
On Wednesday, I attended the historic inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. It brought me tremendous pride to see the first Black and Asian American woman sworn-in as Vice President. I was also inspired by President Biden’s call for unity, compassion, and resolve in the face of the many challenges confronting our country. I look forward to working with the Biden-Harris administration to deliver for the American people, from defeating COVID-19 and rebuilding our economy to healing a divided people at home and repairing our relationships abroad.
 
 
TWO: Fighting COVID-19
Yet even as we celebrated the inauguration of a new president, we also marked a grim milestone: COVID-19 has now claimed more than 400,000 lives across America. Now more than ever we need the kind of aggressive, federally-coordinated pandemic response the Biden-Harris Administration is working to get off the ground – especially when it comes to testing and vaccine distribution. That’s why I was pleased to announce more than half-a-billion dollars is on the way to help New Jersey expand access to vaccines for more of our nine million residents. Learn how to register for the COVID-19 vaccine in New Jersey here. 
 

THREE: The U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021
As the son of Cuban immigrants and the highest-ranking Latino in the U.S. Senate, on Thursday I was honored to announce I will soon introduce the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 – President Biden’s bold and progressive vision for immigration reform. The bill creates an eight-year path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who meet specific criteria and addresses the root causes of migration to our southern border by cracking down on transnational crime, promoting the rule of law, and advancing human rights in Central America. At the same time, the bill clears out visa backlogs, reunites families, protects workers’ rights, and helps more STEM graduates of our universities stay in the country and contribute to our economy. Watch my announcement of this legislation here.

1/29/21 18:32,"Weekly Wrap-Up: COVID-19 relief, healthcare costs","Dear Lindsey,   This week, I've continued to work to deliver pandemic relief and lower healthcare costs for Central Virginians, particularly as it relates to COVID-19 treatments and therapies. Please keep reading for a brief recap of my work. Thank you for sharing in our efforts to deliver on the priorities of Virginia's Seventh District. I am always grateful for the opportunity to serve our communities.
  
 
TOWN HALL
 
  
This Wednesday, I held a telephone town hall to hear directly from Central Virginians about the issues facing our families, businesses, and communities. We were able to discuss the need for additional COVID-19 relief, the Virginia vaccine rollout, and many more issues that are important to our Seventh District neighbors. Thank you to everyone who joined. If you couldn't make it, you can watch the recording below.
  
 

 
  
 
WHAT I'M WORKING ON
 
  
This week, I introduced a bipartisan bill to protect consumers on private health insurance from the high costs associated with COVID-19 antibody therapies and infusions. I have heard directly from concerned Virginians about the out-of-pocket costs of antibody treatments. The Protecting Patient Access to Lifesaving COVID-19 Drugs Act would require that private plans cover these treatments with no cost-sharing – just as they do with COVID-19 testing. No American should be forced to decline necessary healthcare, simply because they fear potential costs. READ MORE
 
I also introduced the RESET for America's Future Act, bipartisan legislation to provide USDA with additional tools to better align the SNAP Education & Training program with the workforce training needs of our communities. In order to come out of this pandemic stronger than before, we must focus on both improving our nation's workforce development programs and increasing access to critical programs like SNAP E&T, or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Employment & Training. READ MORE
 
On Tuesday, I joined a bipartisan group of colleagues in the Problem Solvers Caucus for a conversation with White House National Economic Director Brian Deese about the administration's relief package and how Congress intends to move forward. I am glad to see that the new administration has a clear focus on the needs of our families and communities. We must continue to move forward with additional relief for families and a strategic plan for vaccine distribution. While the Biden Administration announced a 15 percent increase in vaccine supply to states, we still need far more doses to reach essential workers, senior citizens, nursing home residents, and other vulnerable individuals here in the Commonwealth.
  
 
TRUST IN CONGRESS ACT
 
  
WATCH to learn more on my TRUST in Congress Act that was reintroduced last week, requiring Members of Congress and their immediate family members to put their investments in a blind trust while in office:
  
 

 
  
""The bipartisan TRUST in Congress Act would set guidelines to prevent not only actual impropriety, but also the appearance of impropriety. It is difficult to see how anyone in either party could oppose this."" - Larry Sabato, Director, University of Virginia Center for Politics
  
 
IN OUR DISTRICT
 
  
Our constituent services team is here to advocate for all our neighbors in the Seventh District who are having issues with a federal agency. Whether or not we agree on every issue, my office works for you, and we are committed to doing so in any way that we can.
 
Since taking office in January 2019, my team has closed 1,772 constituent cases and returned $4,506,444 in backlogged benefits to Central Virginians.
 
To open a case with us, complete this form online or give us a call at (804) 401-4110.
  
I know that this last month has been particularly hard for our country and our democracy. I want to remind you once more that my team is always here for you. If you need assistance or want to make us aware of a challenge you are facing, call my office at (804) 401-4110 or (202) 225-2815.
 
I will continue to work on the issues and challenges that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, including skyrocketing healthcare costs, rising drug prices, and disparities in healthcare access and coverage for Virginia's minority and underserved communities. We will make it through this pandemic, and we will be stronger than before.

Dear Lindsey,

This week I'm cosponsoring two bills introduced by my friend Congressman Fred Keller of Pennsylvania. Fred joined me last week in New Mexico and Texas to visit border with House Oversight Committee Republicans.

The first bill commends the men and women of Customs and Border Protection for their service. Morale is low among Border Patrol agents as you can hear in this video Fred recorded during our night tour of the border in El Paso.


The Biden administration refuses to call what's happening at our border a crisis. It is a crisis and the undermanned and overworked Border Patrol agents tirelessly and selflessly defending our country and dealing with the situation there deserve to be recognized.

I am also cosponsoring the SHOTS Act. This legislation would instruct the Department of Homeland Security to ensure all individuals here lawfully are given priority over those who are not as COVID-19 vaccines are distributed. Current guidance issued by the Biden administration creates an incentive for individuals to enter the country outside the legal process in order to receive a vaccine, among other benefits.

Simply put: American citizens, taxpayers, and people here legally should get the COVID-19 vaccine, if they want it, before illegal immigrants and terrorists.

What do you think? Share your thoughts with me on Facebook, Twitter, or send me an email.

For New Mexico,

NEWS FROM THE SECOND DISTRICT
Dear Friend, 
This past week, we have honored some of the hardest working groups who put serving others ahead of themselves – nurses, teachers, and moms.   I think it’s safe to say that we are even more grateful for our nurses after this past year. Our nurses have fought on the frontlines of this pandemic. They’ve worked long hours filled with no date indicating when life would return to “normal.” I cannot thank this group enough for all they’ve done for our district and this country.   Florida teachers have returned to the classroom, and despite the challenges they still face, they’ve done a wonderful job getting our students back on track. I know their job is far from easy, but they still get up every day ready to invest in our future generations. Thank you all!   Then, there are the mothers. I, for one, am very thankful for my own mother. I’m also very thankful for my wife, Leah, who not only raised our three sons but has done a tremendous job as a grandmother to our grandsons. Mothers truly are special individuals responsible for raising some of the brightest minds. Their role in society is a valued one. Please join me in thanking all the mothers this Mother’s Day.  I return to Washington, D.C. next week for Session. It’s been nice spending time in the district and catching up with local businesses and leaders. You can read more about my week below: 
This Week in the District  What’s Happening on Capitol Hill  Coronavirus Updates 
 This Week in the District  Visiting Jackson County  

On Wednesday, I toured Catalyst Fabric Solutions in Marianna, FL with Operations Manager Jim King and Executive Director Bill Finley. Catalyst is a large employer for Jackson County and quickly answered the call of service at the height of COVID-19 in March 2020. After working to receive expedited authorization from the FDA, Catalyst swiftly began manufacturing PPE for use by hospitals and medical providers. Today, they are particularly busy thanks to Mother’s Day as they work to fulfill orders of personalized blankets and pillows, among other home décor items. Thank you for inviting me to get a firsthand look at the hard work that goes into your operations!

A trip to Marianna would not have been complete without visiting with Jackson County Sheriff Donnie Edenfield. He has worked hard during his first 100 days on the job. I know that Jackson County is grateful to have his expertise and dedication to service. 
 Brick Industry Association Spring Meeting 

This past week, the Brick Industry Association (BIA) invited me to speak during their annual Spring Meeting. In my speech, I highlighted how important this industry is to our economy and why we need to combat the overregulation that interferes with growth. I also encouraged the group to continue their efforts to educate Congress. In order to have good policy, we need good – and informed – legislators. I appreciate BIA’s work and I’m grateful to have had the opportunity to chat with these fine folks. Thank you all for having me and for choosing the Emerald Coast for your Spring Meeting! 
  
What’s Happening on Capitol Hill  Lower Costs, More Cures  
On Tuesday, the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Health met to discuss legislation to lower the cost of prescription drugs and treatments. During the hearing, we debated the House Democrats’ drug pricing legislation, which would stifle pharmaceutical innovation and tie the availability of cures in America to the decisions made by foreign governments. HR 3 means less cures for American patients.  Americans should have access to these new and innovative cures without the government getting in the way. We should put caps on out-of-pocket costs and revamp the Medicare drug insurance program so that it protects our Seniors. We should also cut red tape and expand innovation. We've seen the benefit of innovation in the fight against COVID-19. Let’s foster more of that.   As a doctor, I see firsthand the toll exorbitant costs can take on patients and their families. I want to fix that, but I don’t think more government is the answer. Now more than ever, Congress should work together on commonsense solutions that will save lives, lower costs, and increase the quality of health care. This is about giving you and your family the best quality of life, and I’m committed to working with my colleagues to make that happen.  
Coronavirus Updates  Get Vaccinated  
Floridians 16 and up are now eligible to receive any COVID-19 vaccine as prescribed by the Food and Drug Administration. The Pfizer vaccine is authorized for persons age 16 and up. The Moderna vaccine is authorized for persons age 18 and up.  I encourage you to pre-register for the COVID-19 vaccine. The State of Florida has partnered with Sharecare to provide an easy-to-use platform that will save your spot for your shot. Pre-register here. Florida has many sites providing the COVID-19 vaccine. Use the vaccine finder to find a site near you. Supplies are limited and appointments may be required.    Traveling This Summer? 
With Summer approaching, many of you may be considering a vacation. For the updated guidelines for domestic travel, click here. For global travel, click here.

West Virginia Families Need Immediate Relief 
Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.) and I introduced bipartisan legislation calling for direct payments to American families to provide much-needed relief in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The Coronavirus Assistance for American Families Act would provide a direct payment of $1,400 to adults and an additional $1,400 to any dependents, including tWest Virginia Families Need Immediate Relief e elderly or those with disabilities. Nearly 8 in 10 Americans support issuing $1,400 direct payments, which is also included in the President’s American Rescue Plan. 

Today’s weak job’s report highlights how American families are struggling and need immediate relief. More than half of households have reported major financial challenges due to the economic and public health crisis. By providing a third round of individual relief, millions of American families would receive the help they need. As Congress continues to negotiate additional COVID-19 relief measures, we must prioritize family-focused direct assistance to those who need it most.
 Background
The Coronavirus Assistance for American Families Act:
	•	Provides $1400 direct payments to each adult and each dependent equally. A couple filing jointly would receive $2,800; a family of four would receive $5,600.
	•	Full payment would go to single filers making $75,000 and joint filers making $150,000; above those levels, the payment decreases by $5 for every $100. This is the same criteria found in the CARES Act.
	•	Includes eligibility for adult dependents, such as those with disabilities and college students.
	•	Offers family-centric payments:
	•	These payments would provide single parents, especially those with multiple children, more assistance than under the CARES Act.
	•	Families that care for elderly or disabled relatives are also eligible for assistance.

Democrats Push Budget Vote
On Wednesday, I voted against the House Democrats “budget” plan that will give the Democrat Majority a blank check to pass their agenda.
Despite President Biden’s rhetoric about unity and bipartisanship, it’s clear that Democrats are intent on ramming through their far-left checklist. Instead of building off the bipartisan COVID relief packages passed and signed into law last year, and working across the aisle to provide targeted relief, Democrats have made it their mission to push a $2 trillion wish list with policies unrelated to the pandemic.
Wednesday's vote is the first step that sets up a process to push through expensive, radical, partisan policies under the guise of COVID relief.
Background:
	•	Reconciliation is a fast-track, budgetary tool used to implement policy changes into law. Legislation considered under reconciliation only requires 51 votes in the Senate for passage.
	•	Triggered by Congress adopting a concurrent budget resolution that includes reconciliation instructions.
	•	Instructs authorizing committees to report legislation that meets specified targets. While reconciliation is often used for deficit reduction, it can also be used to increase spending or reduce revenues.
	•	Although reconciliation is a powerful tool, it does have limits:
	◦	Can only be used to make changes to mandatory spending, revenue levels, and/or the debt limit.
	◦	A maximum of only three reconciliation bills are allowed for each fiscal year’s budget resolution: one for mandatory spending, one for revenue, and one for the debt limit.
	◦	Limited by the Senate’s Byrd Rule which prohibits “extraneous” provisions.

West Virginia Vaccine Rollout Receives National Spotlight
On Tuesday, the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee Oversight and Investigation held a hearing on how states can increase COVID-19 vaccinations where I praised the success of West Virginia COVID-19 rollout and Operation Wrap Speed.
No one is giving proper credit to Operation Wrap Speed. Last year Dr. Fauci testified before the Senate HELP Committee and stated, ‘it could a year to 18 months before a vaccine would be developed.’ But through the hard work of pharmaceutical companies, researchers, and scientists two maybe three vaccines are available in less than a year since Operation Wrap Speed was created. This is truly remarkable.
Operation Warp Speed created the vaccine, it’s the job of the states to put it in people’s arms and some states can’t even get that right. Getting as many Americans vaccinated against COVID-19 as quickly as possible needs to be our top priority. Widespread vaccination is vital to getting back to normal in our daily lives and restoring our economy. Learn from states that are doing this well, don’t make excuses and blame the Trump Administration.  Dr. Clay Marsh, West Virginia's Coronavirus Czar and WVU Health Sciences vice president and executive dean testified on why West Virginia has been so successful in the vaccine rollout. 
""I thank Cong. McKinley for the invitation to join other state healthcare leaders from around the country to discuss West Virginia's successful COVID-19 vaccine rollout. It was an honor to be able to share how West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice assembled a team of state and local partners with the shared purpose of saving lives, promoting the wellbeing of our citizens, and supporting the capacity and function of vital healthcare and community assets,” said Dr. Clay Marsh, West Virginia’s Coronavirus Czar and WVU Health Sciences vice president and executive dean.

Fighting to Reduce the Cost of Medicine
Yesterday, Peter Welch (D-Vt.) and I introduced bipartisan legislation that would address a loophole contributing to the rising cost of health care for consumers and threatening access to lifesaving medications.
The 340B program was created to help hospitals who serve our rural communities with the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs. Unfortunately, the pharmaceutical industry has abused loopholes and hurt rural hospitals and patients by charging exorbitant prices. Our bill would put a stop to this by making sure that the orphan drug exclusion is used as intended, so that patients continue to get the treatment they need.
The 340B Drug Pricing Program requires drug manufacturers to provide outpatient drugs to eligible health care organizations at significantly reduced prices. This includes Federally Qualified Health Centers, Critical Access Hospitals, Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program grantees, and certain types of hospitals and specialized clinics with a high proportion of Medicare and Medicaid patients. Current law excludes so called “orphan drugs,” which are designated by the Department of Health and Human Services and treat rare diseases, from this program. Drug companies take advantage of this loophole to charge higher prices for these drugs even when they are not used for the rare condition or disease that they received orphan status for.
The Closing Loopholes for Orphan Drugs Act would restore the original intent of Congress and close this loophole by limiting the ‘orphan drug’ exclusion to only apply in instances where the drug is used for the rare condition or disease for which it was designated. This will ensure the ‘orphan drug’ designation isn’t exploited to prevent offering the 340B discount for non-orphan uses of the same drug.

100 Days of Building Back Better

President Biden’s Address to a Joint Session of Congress  To celebrate 100 days of Building Back Better, this week President Joe Biden delivered his first Joint Address to Congress.  For the first time in history, two women from the Bay Area – Vice President Harris and myself – sat behind President Biden during his address to Congress, sending the message to women and girls that the sky is the limit.  The policies in President Biden’s speech delivered that same message and was a triumph that put women and families first. 

     Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi at President Biden’s Address to a Joint Session of Congress on Wednesday. 
Thanks to the exceptional leadership of the Biden-Harris Administration and Congressional Democrats, Help Is Here!  In his address President Biden highlighted the historic achievements of his First 100 Days, including The American Rescue Plan, which has helped us combat the pandemic and provide relief to families, communities and small businesses in need.  This monumental accomplishment has helped created more jobs during the first 100 days of the Biden-Harris Administration than any other presidency in history and is projected to cut child poverty in half.   

President Biden also announced transformative legislation to help us seize this once-in-a-century opportunity to Build Back Better from this crisis. 
The American Jobs Plan will invest in American workers by: 
	•	Creating millions of good-paying jobs, rebuilding our country’s critical infrastructure and laying the groundwork for a generation of economic growth
	•	Spurring innovation in clean energy and manufacturing so that America can outcompete any nation in the world
	•	Creating a Made in America tax plan that ensures that big corporations pay their fair share
The American Family Plan will invest in American families by:
	•	Reducing health care costs for working families
	•	Expanding access to affordable childcare and early education
	•	Protecting the expanded Child Tax Credit so that families see bigger paychecks
House Democrats are hard at work advancing these two bold initiatives, which will help America crush the coronavirus and build a stronger, fairer economy.

American Rescue Plan In Action  It was my privilege to invite Dr. Kenneth Tai as my virtual guest for President Biden’s Address.  Dr. Tai serves as the Chief Health Officer of North East Medical Services, a community health center that provides culturally-comfortable, linguistically-appropriate comprehensive health care services here in San Francisco.  North East Medical Services cares for 62,000 Asian-American Pacific Islander and low income patients across twelve clinics, offering primary, specialty and dental care.  Under Dr. Tai’s leadership, NEMS has used the more than $11 million in federal funding from the American Rescue Plan to support COVID-19 vaccination efforts.  The American Rescue Plan delivered nearly $6 billion for over 1,000 community health centers, with nearly $1 billion being awarded to California.  These health centers have been on the frontlines to combat this pandemic, so they have benefitted greatly from the American Rescue Plan and now have the capacity to vaccinate thousands of San Franciscans. 

Congresswoman Pelosi looks on as Dr. Kenneth Tai presents at an American Rescue Plan Teach-In event in San Francisco’s Chinatown at NEMS Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE) Center. 

Remembering the Armenian Genocide  Saturday, April 24th, marked 106 years since the beginning of one of the worst atrocities of the 20th century: the systemic murder of more than 1.5 million Armenian men, women and children by the Ottoman Empire.  On Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day, and every day, we remember the victims and survivors who endured nearly incomprehensible suffering and pledge to honor their lives by recognizing this brutality for what it was.  Tragically, the truth of these heinous crimes has too often been denied, its monstrosity minimized.  That is why our hearts are full of joy that President Biden took the historic step of joining Congress with formal recognition on Armenian Genocide Day.  This landmark action follows Congress’s 2019 resolution declaring that the barbarism committed against the Armenian people was a genocide. 


The deadline for this year’s Congressional Art Competition is this Sunday, May 2.  We encourage all students interested in the competition to apply here. 


Staying Up To Date on COVID in San Francisco   With the ever-present threat of COVID-19, it is important to stay updated with the ongoing changes in our community.  Below you can find some of those changes as well as tools and resources to help with COVID health:

Hello,  I hope you and your loved ones are staying safe and well during these challenging times. Since the 117th Congress began, I have heard countless stories from across our district about the ongoing impact of COVID-19. So many Nevada families are struggling with job loss, virtual learning, and the personal toll of this pandemic, and they need help.  This week, I joined my House colleagues to pass President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, a comprehensive legislative package to help America rebuild from the devastation of the past year.  The American Rescue Plan includes nearly $4 billion for Nevada, with funding to expand vaccination efforts, safely resume in-person learning, and deliver direct payments to individuals and families. The rescue plan also includes my bill to increase and extend federal unemployment payments through August 29 to help Nevadans get back on their feet. To learn more about the American Rescue Plan, click here.  In the coming weeks, President Biden will announce a jobs and economic recovery plan to strengthen small businesses and create millions of jobs. As progress continues in Washington, I’m also working closely with local officials to make sure Nevada has the resources we need to crush the coronavirus and get our economy back on track.

Several weeks ago, I had the opportunity to visit two vaccination centers in Southern Nevada alongside Clark County Commission Chair Marilyn Kirkpatrick and North Las Vegas Councilwoman Pamela Goynes-Brown. Together, we spoke with frontline workers to learn about vaccination efforts, and we discussed how Congress can help speed up vaccine distribution. Along with social distancing and masking, the COVID-19 vaccine is one of our best tools to stop the spread of the virus. To learn more about vaccine eligibility criteria or schedule your vaccination appointment, visit http://snhd.info/covid or call 1-800-401-0946.

Earlier this month, I went to the Capitol to meet with Nevada National Guard troops who had been deployed to Washington after the insurrection on January 6, 2021. During the visit, I spoke with the troops about their experiences and thanked them for their work. I also had the honor to administer the oath of re-enlistment to eight members of the Guard who are continuing their patriotic service.

As we continue to face down multiple crises, my priorities remain the same: crush the coronavirus, get our economy back on track, and restore faith in our democratic institutions.  Since the start of the new Congress, I’ve been proud to introduce a number of bills to help Nevada families and communities, including:
	•	The Unemployed Worker Lifeline Act, which would increase federal unemployment insurance payments by more than 30% and extend payments through the end of the summer. Unless Congress takes action now, federal unemployment payments (which are paid in addition to state unemployment) will expire in March.
	•	The Relaunching America’s Workforce Act, which would help employers prevent layoffs and support job training to help workers re-enter the workforce.
	•	The Keeping the Lights On Act, which provides federal support to small and medium-sized businesses to cover rent, mortgage payments, and essential fixed costs during the coronavirus pandemic.
	•	The U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, which would build new pathways to citizenship for undocumented Americans, protect immigrant families from exploitation and abuse, prioritize smarter border security, and address the root causes of migration.
	•	The Hospitality and Commerce Job Recovery Act, which would which would provide economic relief and recovery assistance to Southern Nevada's critical convention, trade show, entertainment, travel, and hospitality industries and their workers.
	•	The Growing Renewable Energy and Efficiency Now Act (GREEN Act), which would fight climate change by promoting clean energy tech and zero-emission vehicles.
	•	The Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act, which would improve healthcare for mothers and children and help prevent deaths from childbirth, especially for women of color.
	•	The Equality Act, which would extend anti-discrimination protections to LGBTQ+ Americans.
I hope that you will reach out to share your thoughts, opinions, concerns, or questions. You can reach my office at (702) 963-9360 or stay in touch by following me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.  Thank you,

Congressman Steven Horsford

1/29/21 18:47,Major Action to Tackle COVID-19 and the Climate Crisis,"Dear Neighbors,
It’s been a busy week! President Biden promised to increase vaccine supplies to states and signed Executive Orders to make health care more affordable and accessible and to tackle the climate crisis head on. I also want to pass along important announcements on COVID-19 vaccines and economic assistance in New Jersey. You can find them at the end of this newsletter. 
Responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic
On Monday, President Biden announced that the federal government would increase vaccine supplies to states and improve transparency so that states know in advance how many doses they are receiving. The federal government will also purchase 200 million more doses of COVID-19 vaccines, which would allow for the full vaccination of 300 million people.
Making Health Care Affordable and Accessible
President Biden signed two Executive Orders this week to expand access to quality, affordable health care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, access to health care is essential in the fight against this public health crisis. The President directed the reopening of the Healthcare.gov marketplace to ensure Americans can sign up for coverage. In New Jersey, eligible residents can click here to sign up for a plan through May 15.  
President Biden also took the first steps toward reversing the policies of the last four years that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, make it harder to enroll in health care, increase the cost of insurance coverage, and take health insurance away from some of the most vulnerable. I look forward to assisting the new Administration’s efforts to unwind these harmful, and often illegal, changes and to working together on policies that strengthen, protect, and expand access to health care. Read more here
Confronting the Climate Crisis
President Biden’s Executive actions on the climate crisis finally give this crisis the attention it deserves at the national level. These orders will help spur the creation of new good-paying jobs, secure environmental justice, and pause new leases for onshore and offshore oil and gas drilling on federal land and water. 
The climate crisis is an opportunity to empower our workers with new, good paying jobs that can’t be shipped overseas; to prioritize the needs and the voices of our environmental justice communities; to revitalize our energy communities with the support they need to rebuild from this pandemic; and to return our economy to a position of strength after a long, dark year of historic job losses and pain. I look forward to working with the Biden Administration to explore ways we can permanently ban offshore drilling as we transition our country to a clean, low-carbon future. 
I’m proud to stand with the president in this effort and join him in saying: now is our time to act. We will not stand idly by as the rest of the world transitions to clean energy and our workers get left behind, and we will not watch from the sidelines as the climate crisis wreaks havoc on Americans’ health and homes. Read more here 
This week, I went to Perth Amboy with Governor Murphy to see New Jersey’s first community solar project. Projects like these make it clear that we don’t have to choose between fighting climate change and economic growth. I’m proud that our state is leading the way on our path toward a clean, low-carbon future as we invest in green, good-paying jobs right here at home. 
Delivering for New Jersey 
I announced this week that New Jersey will receive $216 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for costs associated with storage, transport, distribution, and administration of COVID-19 vaccines. The funding will be distributed to the New Jersey State Police who are working with the New Jersey Department of Health to distribute and administer COVID-19 vaccines. As vaccines become more widely available, I’ll continue to work with the Biden Administration so that everyone can get vaccinated. Read more here 
I’m pleased that New Jersey’s commercial and recreational fishing industry is finally receiving funding that I fought to include in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Our fishing communities have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, which is why I fought so hard to include robust funding in the CARES Act and have worked to ensure that funding is distributed to those who need it most. Read more here 
Local COVID-19 Announcements
An important announcement for New Jerseyans who have received their first COVID-19 vaccine dose: 
New Jersey has automatically scheduled second vaccine doses for those who have received their first dose by registering through the state’s online portal.
If you booked directly with a vaccine site for your first dose and did not book your second dose appointment at the time of your first shot, then you need to contact the site where you received that first shot to schedule your second. If you are still not certain how you will get your second dose appointment, contact New Jersey’s Vaccination Call Center at 855-568-0545 and operators will assist you with scheduling one. 
The New Jersey Economic Development Authority is launching Phase 2 of its Small Business Emergency Assistance Loan program. The program will make up to $100,000 in low-interest financing available to eligible small businesses and nonprofits in New Jersey. Pre-registration begins February 10 at 9 AM. Click here to learn more 
Eligible uninsured New Jersey residents will have another opportunity to enroll in health insurance plans until May 15, 2021. Go to getcovered.nj.gov for more information. 
New Jersey’s Department of Human Services is extending COVID-19 childcare assistance programs through the end of February. The Department will also continue to waive co-pays in the state’s childcare subsidy program for parents who request it due to impacts from COVID-19. Click here for more information

My Appointment to the Select Subcommittee On The Coronavirus Crisis
Earlier this week, I was appointed to serve on the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis. This Subcommittee was created last year to provide oversight of the federal government’s pandemic response and modeled after a similar committee then Senator Harry Truman led during the Second War to oversee mobilization efforts. In my role on the Subcommittee, I will work to ensure the effective and transparent use of taxpayer funds for COVID-19 relief programs and to address the shortcomings of the vaccine rollout process. This pandemic has led to a global public health crisis as well as an economic crisis, and I will use my time serving on the Subcommittee to provide relief to the families in our community on both fronts.
Service Academy Nomination Celebration
One of the duties of a member of Congress is to nominate candidates for appointment to four of the U.S. service academies: the U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Air Force Academy, and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. This year, I had the opportunity to nominate 13 outstanding students from the district. These young people have decided to dedicate their education and the beginning of their careers to the security of our country. I was honored to be able to spend time with these students on Wednesday at our virtual Service Academy Nomination Celebration, and I commend them for their desire to serve.
 

From our virtual Service Academy Nomination Celebration
Reintroduction of the STOP Bullying Act
Today, I reintroduced the bipartisan STOP Bullying Act alongside Congresswoman Jenniffer González-Colón (R-PR). This legislation will address bullying faced by LGBTQ students and those of all backgrounds by establishing a federal grant program for schools to create anti-bullying task forces, comprised of teachers, school administrators, parents, students, child psychologists, and representatives from supporting organizations to combat the problem. This type of anti-bullying task force has been modeled on the success of existing programs in thirteen states and the District of Columbia.

2/12/21 18:30,Keeping you updated,"Dear Lindsey,

This week in Washington was a “committee work week” – a week when members are not voting on the House floor but are instead meeting in their respective committees to attend hearings and markups. I flew to D.C. to attend markups for both the Education and Labor Committee and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Our Education and Labor Committee bill markup lasted 13 hours! Just hours after we wrapped up that first committee markup of the year, I was back in the office with the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee. It was a very busy few days, and I am looking forward to spending some time back in the district this upcoming week. 

I am also writing to you at the start of the Lunar New Year – and want to wish you all a healthy, safe, and prosperous year. This year has been challenging for many, but with the new year comes a new beginning and the hope of better days ahead. Happy New Year! 

I’ll be using this newsletter as a way to keep you up to date on my work on behalf of our Orange County community, so make sure you sign up for regular updates. You can also connect with my official Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages, where I’ll be posting the latest news and updates. 

Serving California's 48th District

Securing aid for OC Cities
Did you know that the majority of Orange County's cities did not meet the population threshold to receive direct aid via the CARES Act’s Coronavirus Relief Fund? This week I joined a bipartisan letter to House leadership requesting these cities, which face equal pandemic challenges, are not left behind. Read the letter here.  

Mental Health Resources in Orange County 
COVID19 has affected all Americans and amplified the need for mental health resources in our community. MemorialCare is now offering a free online resource for those struggling in our SoCal Community. Access their free resources here.

Safely Reopening our Schools 
This week I’ve continued my work to open our schools and get our students back in the classroom.
﻿
I joined over 60 of my colleagues in a letter to President Biden urging him to follow the science and safely reopen schools across the country. In December, then President-Elect Biden pledged to open the nation’s schools during his first 100 days in office. However, last month the Administration said that the goal only applied to schools teaching students up to eighth grade, and just this week they adjusted their pledge, stating that schools will be considered “open” if they are providing in-person instruction once a week. Read the letter here. 
﻿
During our Education & Labor Committee Markup of the proposed budget for the next fiscal year, which included President Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID relief legislation, I spoke in support of private and public schools as they work to educate students safely. I also offered an amendment that would have required schools to reopen as soon as vaccines are made available to teachers. This would not have required teachers to be vaccinated, rather it would have classrooms reopen once teachers had the opportunity to protect themselves from the virus. 


Supporting the Mental Health of our Transportation Workers 
During our Transportation and Infrastructure markup, I offered an amendment that would have provided funds to organizations that support the mental health of our transportation workers, who are face-to-face with millions of Americans nationwide every single day. My colleague from California, Rep. Grace Napolitano, offered to work together in support of mental health support and funding. This is a bipartisan issue that we can all get behind. 


Cutting Taxes 
This week I cosponsored bipartisan legislation to fully restore the State and Local Tax (SALT) Deduction. The SALT deduction cap of $10,000 has resulted in a tax increase for many middle-class families. In California and other high cost of living areas, the SALT cap has been harmful. That’s why I am proud to cosponsor this legislation to help get more money back in your pocket. Read more.

Here's what local House members are doing, so far, in the legislative fight against COVID-19

Freshman GOP Rep. Michelle Steel of Seal Beach has been focused on getting students back in classrooms. Last week, she spoke on the House floor to support the Reopen Schools Act, which would make sure that the $54 billion in federal coronavirus aid set aside for education in the COVID-19 relief bill would go only to schools that have re-opened for in-person instruction.

Coronavirus Update

On Monday, Michigan reported 10,293 new cases of COVID-19 and 21 new death, bringing the state’s total cases to 702,499 and deaths to 16,239. The number of new cases jumped by 11% over the past week. Michigan currently leads the country in COVID cases by population. For six straight weeks the percentage of positive COVID tests have risen, bringing the current rate to 15%. School and youth sports continue to significantly impact Michigan’s case counts, with kids ages 10 to 19 accounting for the fastest growing outbreaks. Michigan has seen a 24% rise in COVID deaths since early March. Hospitalizations continue to spike throughout the state, with a 60% jump in COVID hospitalization last week compared to the week before.
Michigan continues to have the second-highest reported cases of the more contagious B.1.1.7. COVID variant that originated in the UK. The first case of the P.1 COVID variant that originated in Brazil has been confirmed in Michigan. State health officials are closely monitoring the spread of 3 different COVID variants throughout Michigan that continue to impact our mitigation efforts.  
On Monday, Michigan reported 22.6% of Michiganders have been fully vaccinated against COVID. Michigan has reported 5,623,595 COVID vaccines have been distributed and, of that, 4,706,383 vaccines have been administered.
This week, Michigan expanded vaccine eligibility to all Michiganders 16 and up. If you are eligible to get a vaccine, please do so. If you have questions about how to get a vaccine, reach out. I was scared and nervous to get my vaccine in the beginning but overcame my anxiety and am better off because of it. Vaccines truly offer us the best hope at putting this virus behind us and preventing more losses of the ones we love.
We continue to work hard to improve vaccine supply. The American Rescue Plan has provided us the critical resources needed to do just that, bringing steady improvements to our nation’s overall response and vaccine supply.
As vaccines rapidly ramp up, we must fully commit to following health guidelines by wearing our masks, keeping our physical distance, and washing our hands.  
Legislative Update

The American Rescue Plan is continuing to put money in pockets, shots in arms, kids in schools, people in jobs.
As of last week, the IRS had distributed over 130 million survival checks to Americans, totaling $335 billion. The IRS is issuing “plus-up” payments to Americans who received smaller payments based on 2019 tax returns but have recently filed 2020 returns that qualify them for a higher payment. On Friday, the IRS began processing a large number o payments for Social Security beneficiaries who did not file a 2020 or 2019 tax return, including Social Security retirement, survivor of disability (SSDI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) beneficiaries. The IRS expects to have the majority of these payments completed by April 7.
Over the last month, vaccinations have accelerated by almost 40%, bringing the average daily rate to 2.3 million shots. As supply ramps up, the American Rescue Plan is providing critical funding for vaccine administration infrastructure, including more vaccination sites in our communities.
After a year of major difficulties for Michigan schools due to the COVID pandemic, the American Rescue Plan is delivering essential aid to help schools overcome pandemic-related learning loss, mental health impacts on students, and tools to get students back in their desks SAFELY.
On Friday, the Labor Department reported an increase of 916,000 in payrolls, far surpassing the expectations of economists. Some of the strongest employment gains were in industries hardest hit by the impacts of COVID. The American Rescue Plan is restoring our economy to pre-pandemic levels at record rate and improving the lives of Americans after an extremely difficult year.

Weekly Update from Dr. Joyce May 23, 2021
Dear Neighbor, 
Welcome to another edition of my newsletter. Updates and important information are outlined below. Thank you for taking the time to read about what I’ve been working on this week. If you would like to share my e-newsletters with others, please direct them to this link to subscribe.  

DEFENDING PENNSYLVANIA ENERGY JOBS 
For centuries, Pennsylvanians have powered America. This week during an Energy and Commerce Committee hearing, I emphasized the importance of Pennsylvania energy production and asked U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm to acknowledge this basic fact. As Pennsylvanians understand firsthand, coal provides the constant baseload power that is the backbone of the American electric grid and keeps our country moving.  
I also encouraged Secretary Granholm to work along side Pennsylvanians to find innovative solutions that keep workers at the forefront of America’s energy production. Watch my full conversation with Secretary Granholm. 

***  HONORING THE LIFE AND WORK OF DR. MAGEE  
This week, it was my privilege to honor the life and legacy of my friend and fellow Altoona physician, Dr. R. Samuel Magee. An exemplary surgeon, Dr. Magee devoted 45 years to practicing medicine and saving lives. Most recently, he served Pennsylvania veterans as the Chief of Staff of the James E. Van Zandt VA Medical Center in Altoona.   Dr. Magee was a champion for solutions to the tough problems. Together, we shared a mission to improve Pennsylvanians’ access to quality health care – regardless of their zip code. 
At the VA, Dr. Magee was a leader in the launch of my Homegrown Health Care Initiative, which aims to reverse the doctor shortage in rural communities. I am grateful for all the work he did to care for our community, and Alice and I are praying for Dr. Magee's wife, Bunny, their family, loved ones, patients, and our veteran community as they mourn this profound loss. Watch my full tribute to Dr. Magee. 

*** HEARING FROM PENNSYLVANIANS   This week, I hosted a telephone town hall to hear from many of you about the issues and concerns that matter to you and your family. I was encouraged to hear from Pennsylvanians about issues ranging from national security and the economy to health care and our fundamental rights. Thank you to all who participated in this week's telephone town hall, and I look forward to future opportunities to hear from you.  

*** GETTING AMERICANS BACK TO WORK 
Right now, our nation is facing a workforce crisis. As we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, President Biden's liberal policies are disincentivizing Americans' return to work. 
On Monday, I went down to the House Floor to highlight the importance of hard work and its essential role in our society. For generations, American workers have built and forged our nation, and we are indebted to them. 
We cannot allow President Biden and the Democrats to sabotage our forward momentum as we recover from the pandemic. From day one in office, the president has promised big government interference that comes with higher taxes and more regulation for American businesses. We must return to a pro-work, pro-growth agenda that supports American workers and helps our communities succeed. Watch my full remarks. 

*** HIGHLIGHTING PENNSYLVANIA'S SMALL BUSINESS LEADERS 
Recently, I had the chance to visit The Pet Store, a small business in Chambersburg, to meet with owner Angie Cutchall. We had a great discussion about her work to pair puppies with their forever homes. Small businesses, such as The Pet Store, are an essential part of the Chambersburg community.  

*** 
In Franklin County, I also met with Chambers Apothecary co-owner Pharmacist Rob Norris. We discussed the pharmacy's excellent work to improvise, adapt, and overcome difficult challenges during the past year. From manufacturing hand sanitizer and providing coronavirus testing in the early days of the pandemic to administering vaccines, Chambers Apothecary has been on the frontlines of the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. 

*** NATIONAL EMS WEEK 
This week, we recognized the important service of Emergency Medical Services in our community. In rural communities, EMT's are the first line of medical care, providing aid and comfort to the sick and injured before they reach a hospital. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, these Pennsylvanians often shouldered enormous responsibility and played a vital role in keeping our communities safe and healthy. As a doctor, I understand this critical work, and I thank these heroes for their service to our communities.  

*** ANNOUNCING THE CONGRESSIONAL ART COMPETITION WINNER 
Each year the Congressional Art competition highlights the talent and creativity of high school students, and winning artwork s showcased in the halls of Congress. It is my honor to announce that Emily Dunn, a senior at Central High School in Martinsburg, Pennsylvania, won the competition with her painting entitled ""Frozen in Time.""  
Emily's piece captures the rustic beauty of the Colvin Covered Bridge in Bedford County, and I look forward to seeing her work displayed in the U.S. Capitol. Thank you to all the students from Pennsylvania's 13th Congressional District who submitted artwork. Our region is blessed with incredibly talented students, and I am grateful to all who submitted their artwork to the competition.  

*** PROMOTING SAFETY IN THE FUTURE OF AUTOMATED VEHICLES 
During an Energy and Commerce Committee hearing on Tuesday, I advocated for increased safety and transparency from automakers that are manufacturing automated vehicles driving on American roads.   While there are clear safety benefits of highly-automated passenger cars, we also expect to see safety benefits in a variety of other applications. Many of these solutions are years down the road and require a stable regulatory framework. I often hear concerns about driverless cars on the roadways, and Congress must provide oversight as technology evolves. Watch my full conversation with the committee witnesses. 


COVID-19 VACCINE UPDATE 
All adults in Pennsylvania are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccination. If you would like to find an available vaccine, you can find detailed provider information at the PA COVID-19 vaccine portal. If you have questions about the vaccination process or eligibility, please call the Pennsylvania Department of Health at 1-877-724-3258. To find a vaccine distribution site and for help scheduling your vaccine appointment, please visit the COVID-19 vaccine provider map. 

Thank you for catching up on some of the things I’ve been working on this week. As always, additional information can be found on my website and my Facebook page. If my team and I can be of assistance to you, please call any of my offices or contact me online.

1/24/21 14:10,An Update from Congressman David Kustoff,"Dear Friends,

On Wednesday at the inauguration of President Joe Biden, he called for unity among all Americans to ensure success for our nation. I agree. As Americans, we must come together to reconcile our differences and move our country forward.

However, unity does not come by prioritizing policies such as open borders (especially in the age of COVID-19), decimating our oil and gas industries, and granting citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants. Instead the first priority should be getting Americans back to work, helping small businesses, and getting our children back in school.

Our men and women of the National Guard, including many from the Tennessee National Guard, have been bravely stationed around the Capitol complex to keep us safe and protect our democracy. After learning they were asked to vacate the Capitol and relocate outdoors or in the garages, I wrote a letter to Speaker Pelosi demanding answers. Our troops risk their lives every day to defend our nation and they deserve better than this. Thank you to the Tennessee National Guard and all the National Guard for all you do!




Friday marked 48 years since Roe v. Wade. We must all remember that life is precious. I firmly believe in the sanctity of life and our country should always fight for those innocent lives who cannot fight for themselves. That is why I will always proudly be pro-life.

12/22/20 15:49,An Update on Year-End COVID Relief,"Dear Neighbor,

As you may have heard, last night, the House of Representatives and the Senate passed critical COVID-19 relief as a part of the annual year-end spending legislation.

This has been a difficult and challenging year by all measures.  The health and economic impacts of this pandemic continue to be staggering, affecting all aspects of our lives and our livelihoods.  Our communities continue to bear the brunt of responding to this public health emergency. 

For months, I have heard from our neighbors, our local leaders, and the experts here in our community about what the needs of our district are, and I have used our stories to advocate for additional legislation to provide relief.

This agreement should have passed months ago, but I am glad that the House and Senate finally reached bipartisan consensus to provide COVID relief that addresses many of the concerns facing communities, which is why I voted in favor of it.  The bill contains extended unemployment benefits, direct stimulus payments for American families, support for small businesses, rental assistance, funding for schools and local transit authorities, and funding for vaccine distribution. 

This bill also includes among its many provisions my bipartisan legislation to help small businesses during this time by making certain expenses paid through PPP loans eligible for tax deductions.  Small businesses are the backbone of our communities, and my provision reverses misguided IRS guidance that would have hurt small businesses in our district and across the country.

Here is a summary of what the year-end COVID-19 package will provide:
	•	Economic Impact Payments: $600 per adult and child; payments could begin to be distributed as soon as next week.
	•	Enhanced Unemployment Insurance Benefits: averts expiration of Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits for millions and restores a $300 per week UI enhancement for Americans who are out of work.
	•	Paycheck Protection Funding: $284 billion for a new and second-round of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans; a simplified loan forgiveness process for PPP loans under $150,000; key modifications to PPP to better serve the smallest businesses, struggling non-profits, and independent restaurants; and $15 billion in dedicated funding for entertainment venues and cultural institutions.
	•	Small Business Grants: $20 billion for targeted EIDL grants of $10,000.
	•	Nutrition Assistance: $13 billion in increased SNAP and child nutrition benefits to help relieve the hunger crisis.
	•	Rental Assistance: $25 billion for rental assistance and an extension of the eviction moratorium.
	•	Education and Child Care: $82 billion in funding for colleges and schools, including support for HVAC repair and replacement to mitigate virus transmission and reopen classrooms, and $10 billion for child care assistance to help get parents back to work and keep child care providers open.
	•	Broadband Access: $7 billion to increase access to broadband, including a new Emergency Broadband Benefit to help millions of students, families and unemployed workers afford the broadband they need during the pandemic. 
	•	Vaccine Distribution:  Billions in funding to accelerate vaccine distribution and to implement a strong national testing and tracing strategy. 
In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress must respond to the changing needs of the people across our country in a meaningful way.  This agreement leaves critical needs unmet, and there will be much more work to do in the weeks and months ahead.   I am committed to fighting for our district as we face this challenge together.  And everyone in my office is ready to help in any way we can.  Please do not hesitate to call my office to share your thoughts or get help—that is what we are here for.  Best wishes,

4/1/21 13:29,"Reminder: Rep. Blake Moore's Weekly Newsletter: Visit to Box Elder County, northern Utah's vaccination efforts, virtual committee hearings, and more!","March 29, 2021



Dear Fellow Utahn,
 
It was a busy week in the First District witnessing the amazing work happening around northern Utah. 

Visit to Box Elder County


My week started in Box Elder County where I met with Weber Basin District Water Conservancy Trustees and Box Elder County Commissioners to learn about their current priorities. I visited Bailey Farms, an inland port site, which ships alfalfa and other products around the world. 




I also got to tour Storm Products with Steve Kloempken, the company’s Vice President of Marketing. Storm Products is the world’s largest manufacturer of bowling balls, and it’s headquartered in the heart of Brigham City. The Storm Products team let me try out a few bowling balls, and I even bowled a few strikes!  


Hill Air Force Base with Acting Secretary Roth

A major highlight of the week was visiting Hill Air Force Base with Acting Secretary of the Air Force John Roth. Team Hill did an incredible job walking us through their impressive daily operations and contributions to our national defense. It’s an honor to represent the men and women at Hill Air Force Base, and I was grateful Acting Secretary Roth was able to meet the team and see their amazing work. Thanks for having us, Team Hill! 



Northern Utah's Vaccination Efforts




The First District is answering the call to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, and I visited two vaccine centers that are working hard to efficiently vaccinate Utah. On Thursday, I went to Weber-Morgan’s vaccination clinic at the Dee Events Center. Weber-Morgan Health Department is coordinating 100 volunteers at this site daily, and 60-70 vaccinations are administered every 15 minutes. In addition, Walmart and Sam’s Club recently announced that their pharmacies will provide vaccines, and we are fortunate to have 10 participating stores in the First District. On Friday, I visited the Walmart and Sam’s Club in Logan and talked to the pharmacists leading the vaccination effort. They are going above and beyond to help Utahns protect themselves and their loved ones from COVID-19, and we are grateful for their work.  


Virtual Meetings and Committee Hearings

I participated in several virtual meetings this week, including a discussion with the Public Lands Council. Cattle and sheep ranchers from across the nation were in attendance, and we had a productive conversation about the challenges western states are facing in regard to land management and ways we can improve. The Public Lands Council is working hard to advocate for western ranchers, and the First District appreciates their efforts. 

Though virtual, we were busy with committee work throughout the week. The Natural Resources Committee hosted a hearing on the Biden Administration’s plans for public land management, and the Armed Services Committee held hearings on a range of topics including the Department of Defense’s operations in cyberspace, training mishap prevention, and extremism in the military. I am grateful to serve on these committees and learn about policies and programs that impact the First District. 
 
Please reach out to my Ogden office at (801) 625-0107 if you need help scheduling a meeting, navigating a federal agency, or addressing casework. It is an honor to serve you.

Dear Friend,
 
Texas is facing severe winter weather this week and many communities are dealing with slick roads, power outages and more. If you can avoid traveling, please do so. If not, please stay safe and stay alert while on the road. 
 
While we conitnue to battle the coronavirus pandemic, we must make sure that every American in every community is able to receive the critical medical care that they and their families need. In January, President Biden signed an executive order to open up the federal health insurance marketplace. Now until May 15th, you can get health coverage through ACA’s marketplace at HealthCare.gov.
 
The enrollment window is open to anyone who is uninsured and would normally be eligible to buy coverage in the federal marketplace.
 
As always, I urge you to follow my social media platforms @repcuellar to stay up to date on what's happening in the district and in DC.
 
Additionally, if you need assistance with a federal agency, please reach out to my office.

 
 
Rep. Cuellar Visits Encinal COVID Vaccine Distribution Event
 

  
On Friday, February 12th, I visited the City of Encinal to meet with local frontline health care workers and constituents during a vaccine distribution event at the Encinal Veterans’ Hall. Thank you to County Judge Joel Rodriguez, the County Commissioners, Mayor Sylvano Sanchez, City Manager Velma Davila and the rest of the city and county staff who helped make this event possible. While we continue to work towards vaccinating all of our communities, remember to protect yourself and your loved ones by wearing a mask.

Later that Friday, I held a press conference with city officials, as well as local non-governmental organizations in Webb County and the Rio Grande Valley that help shelter migrants. Together, we discussed the increase in migrant individuals released at the southern border without being screened for COVID-19 and how it is affecting our communities.

Earlier on Wednesday, I started my day off in San Antonio, where I announced that IDEA Carver student, Noah Moncrieft, has been accepted into United States Military Academy West Point. I had the privilege of nominating Mr. Moncrieft and a select group of highly qualified students in the 28th Congressional District of Texas for an appointment to one of the U.S. Services Academies- Air Force, Naval, Military, Merchant Marine. Congratulations!

UTRGV Discusses COVID-19
 

  
On Tuesday, February 9th, my Outreach Coordinator for Starr and Hidalgo Counties, Nicolas Cruz, virtually attended a meeting with the UTRGV COVID Reponse Team to discuss the protocol that the university implemented, including rapid COVID-19 response tests and monitoring. During the meeting, Nicolas briefed the team on a recent letter I sent to Governor Abbott, requesting the the National Guard be deployed to South Texas to help with vaccine distribution. 

 
 
Intern Spotlight: Diego Hinojosa
 

  
On this week's intern spotlight, we're introducing Diego Hinojosa, who currently interns in my San Antonio office. Originally from Brownsville, Diego is a 3rd year college student, studying politics and law at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Diego helps assist my constituents in acquiring much-needed federal support.  During the internship, he hopes to learn more about the legislative process and eventually land an internship in Washington, D.C. 
 
When he's not interning, you can find Diego hiking with family, playing guitar, and reading. Welcome to the team and I look forward to seeing all the great work you do for TX-28!

 
Sincerely,

  
Henry Cuellar

Dear Friends,
 
I want to thank everyone who joined my first virtual town hall of the year last night. In case you missed the event, I wanted to share some of the top questions we received, and my responses. You can also watch the full event here. 
	•	Do you think the Senate should abolish the filibuster? Yes, it should. This has been something that has undercut progress for years and I hope we can get rid of it. 
	•	Do you think Former President Trump should be convicted by the Senate? Absolutely. We lived at the crime scene and we saw it. I think it’s time to hold him accountable even as he tries to slink out of town to Mar-a-Lago. 
	•	Do you think Marjorie Taylor Green should be expelled from Congress? No question. This woman is unbalanced, and I think almost criminally insane. She has no place being in the United States Congress. 
	•	How do you think the vaccine rollout is going? It’s not good enough. We need more. We need more of it in the arms. Here in Oregon I hope we can get somebody in charge to move it forward. This is something we can’t afford to not do right. We need to do more work to make it smoother and faster.  
	•	What is the latest status of the $2,000 stimulus checks? As you know, we struggled with the Republican Senators to be able to get the $2,000. There was $600 first and then it was a battle to get the next $1,400. We are fighting to make sure we have reoccurring payments. Many of the problems that we are facing in our community and around the country is simply that people don’t have money. Until we are able to return to normal, there is no substitute for putting money in people’s pockets. 
	•	Do you support statehood for Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico?  Absolutely. You know, we saw the problems for Washington, D.C. not having the power of a state that delayed the ability to get the national guard in a state of emergency. If it was a state that wouldn’t happen. That’s yet one more reason to empower the voters of Washington, D.C. to have their own Senators and a voting member of the House
	•	Do you support Medicare for All? Yes.
	•	Do you think we will be able to legalize marijuana finally? We ended the last Congress on a high note, passing the MORE Act that I’ve been working on for years, that would fully legalize. We passed legislation to have safe banking, even research. Just today I talked to Senator Booker who’s going to lead on our MORE Act in the Senate. We’re optimistic that we’ll get the job done this year. 
Thank you again to everyone who joined the town hall. As a reminder, you can hear the rest of the discussion in my virtual town hall replay here.  
 
I’m hopeful we can have more conversations like this as we work together in the new Congress and with the Biden administration to deliver results. If you have a suggestion for a future town hall topic, I’d love to hear from you.
  
Courage,

  
Earl Blumenauer

BLAINE'S BULLETIN: EASTER 2021
Luke 24:6-7: ""He is not here; he has risen!""
Today is Good Friday, the day when Jesus suffered and died on the cross to save us from our sins. It seems ironic that a day with such tragedy be referred to as “good,” but God sending his only son to die for us was incredibly good, and through Jesus’ death came his resurrection and the victory of good over evil leading to Easter - the holiest day of the year for Christians and the ultimate reminder of God’s love for us. 
Last Easter, the coronavirus was just beginning to really spread across our country creating a sense of panic and fear of the unknown for what is to come and resulting in one of the most difficult years in memory. We lost Missourians to Covid. Doctors, nurses and hospital staff worked nonstop and did everything they could to get us all safely through the pandemic. Small business owners struggled to keep the restaurants, hardware stores, barber shops, florists, ice cream parlors they had poured their heart and souls into open while many Missourians stayed home to slow the spread. Teachers did everything they could to make teaching their students from home as effective as possible and went to extraordinary lengths to keep them from falling behind. But this Easter season, Missouri has much to celebrate with our state successfully coming out of the pandemic and life returning to normal.  
Just like with Jesus’ resurrection, Easter brings new beginnings. It is fitting that it is always celebrated in the spring when nature comes back to life after a long winter, and plants and flowers have begun to bloom. This Easter, we can also celebrate new beginnings here in our state. With most students back in school, businesses opening, and more Missourians becoming eligible for the vaccine, we are starting fresh and getting back to life in this great state as we know it. Just this week, Phase 2 of vaccine distributions opened. The Cardinals and Royals will soon welcome fans into their stadiums, and those of us who live near the Lake of the Ozarks will begin welcoming thousands of visitors each weekend. 
Jackie and I will be spending our Easter at church and with family – an Easter egg hunt for the kids and a good meal is hard to beat. No matter your beliefs or how you choose to worship, on behalf of my family, I wish you and yours a very Happy Easter!

Focusing On Real Relief To Defeat COVID-19
 
  Dear Neighbor,  This week, we were proud to introduce bills to help the American people during the pandemic. We introduced “Crush The Virus” Act, a standalone, $163 billion relief legislation focused on crushing the COVID-19 virus. This act specifically prioritizes the health and safety of the American people by:
 
	•	Providing direct funds to increase the distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines
	•	Boosting access to COVID-19 testing throughout the nation
	•	Supporting additional medical research into new emerging variants, among other public health initiatives.
 
While more must be done, passing this type of targeted relief legislation would ensure we immediately address the public health needs of the country and accelerate the defeat of COVID-19.
 
Unfortunately, many of my colleagues in Congress were satisfied to push a bloated, partisan package that does nothing to ensure aid actually reaches those in desperate need of support. They even blocked a vote on our BIPARTISAN amendment to stop felons, including child molesters, rapists, and other public predators from receiving a stimulus check.
 
We also introduced the New Markets Tax Credit Extension Act of 2021 with Rep. Terri Sewell to spur economic revitalization in low-income rural communities and urban neighborhoods as the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis continues. As our nation recovers from the public health and economic impacts of COVID-19, we must do everything we can to uplift and stand with historically underserved communities.  Getting these bills passed are crucial to getting help to the American people who need it desperately. People are suffering and are in need of immediate relief – we cannot wait to act.  Until Next Time,  Tom

Hi, it’s Senator Kelly Loeffler. For many Georgians, Christmas means gathering with loved ones, celebrating the birth of Jesus and reflecting on the past year as we look to the new year ahead. This particular holiday season comes at the end of what has been a difficult year for most of us – the COVID-19 pandemic, financial disruption, separation from friends and family and increased uncertainty in nearly every aspect of our lives.
Despite these challenges, what I have seen as I have traveled around Georgia this year is a drive to create a better future for our families and our communities. The good news is that there is an abundance of help on the way. As of this week, we have two highly effective vaccines that will be given to millions of Americans by the end of the year. Congress has also passed a $900 billion relief package, which I voted for, to help Georgia families, small businesses, schools and farmers impacted by COVID-19. You can read more below. 
Looking for more information on what I’m working on for Georgia? Be sure to stay updated on the latest by following me on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and subscribing to my YouTube.
I encourage you to make sure your family, friends and neighbors sign up for my updates so they never miss important news.
 
DELIVERING COVID-19 RELIEF FOR GEORGIA
After months of the Democrats playing politics with Americans’ health and livelihoods by blocking additional relief for our families, schools and small businesses, Congress finally passed a new COVID-19 relief bill that will deliver nearly $1 trillion in additional aid to the American people on top of the $3 trillion already disbursed.
Over $47 billion has already gone directly to Georgia’s families, farmers, front-line workers, schools and hospitals, but more assistance is on the way. The package I voted for this week includes $284.5 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program, a second stimulus check to help families make ends meet, $82 billion to help schools reopen, nearly $30 billion for vaccine procurement and distribution and $16 billion to support airlines. The relief bill also includes the targeted help for farmers that I championed, including opening the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) to livestock and poultry producers, $13 billion in supplementary assistance for farmers who incurred losses due to the pandemic and requring payments to domestic cotton farmers. 
Sadly, but not surprisingly, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi made this much harder than it ever needed to be, purposely holding up relief that could have been delivered months ago. Republicans have been voting to pass this relief since September – but for Democrats, it’s all politics all the time.
More on my efforts to deliver relief for Georgia.
 
HELPING HOMELESS VETERANS
The Reducing Veterans Homelessness Act – a bill I introduced – has been passed by Congress and will soon become law. This bill will improve two programs at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to prevent and reduce veteran homelessness. As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I will never stop fighting to help those who fought for us. Every American hero deserves to have a roof over their head, and I am proud that my legislation has cleared Congress and is heading to President Trump’s desk to be signed into law.
 
SUPPORTING UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES
Earlier this month, I introduced the Economic Empowerment for Underserved Communities Act to increase access to capital, create jobs and encourage long-term investments in low-income minority communities. I am proud to have Senators Marco Rubio, Mike Crapo and Thom Tillis join me in this effort to invest in these underserved communities and help more Americans start businesses and create jobs. I am committed to passing legislation to help every Georgian achieve the American Dream. You can read more here. The COVID-19 relief package I voted for complements my legislation by providing $12 billion to increase investment in small minority owned businesses through the Community Development Financial Institutions program and extending the New Markets Tax Credit. 
 
COVID-19 VACCINE ARRIVES IN GEORGIA
Last week, the Pzifer COVID-19 vaccine officially arrived in Georgia and began to be distributed. Over the weekend, a second vaccine, developed by Moderna, was approved and will soon arrive in the Peach State. A vaccine that some thought would be years away was, in fact, developed in mere months. Thanks to Operation Warp Speed, President Trump’s commitment and the funding provided by Congress, millions of Americans will be protected from COVID-19 before the end of the year. 
 
HONORING PRESIDENT CARTER 
This week, the Senate passed a bill to establish the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park, in Plains, Georgia. When you think of Plains, Georgia, you think of President Jimmy Carter and his family’s legacy. President Carter has selflessly served the Peach State for decades, and a national park named for this native son of Georgia is a tribute that will endure for years to come. 
 
COBB COUNTY SCHOOLS TAKE ACTION TO KEEP SCHOOLS SAFE
Last Friday, the Cobb County School Board of Education expanded two innovative health and safety technologies to all 67 elementary schools in the county. When Cobb County begins its new semester in January 2021, these state-of-the-art measures will help ensure students and educators alike are safe and healthy in the classroom. I am glad that such innovative programs have already been piloted right here in Georgia, and I remain committed to supporting students, teachers, staff and communities to ensure they have the tools for a safe return to in-person education for families who want that option.

12/10/20 14:30,Relief Can't Wait,"The Durbin Report: A message from Senator Richard J. Durbin 



Fellow Illinoisan,   As the holidays approach, COVID-19 continues to surge across the United States.  Last week was the deadliest week in the U.S. since the pandemic began, and we are setting alarming new records for hospitalizations nearly every day.   My heart goes out to all those dealing with incredible grief and sadness during this time.  There are few words any of us can say to comfort the families and loved ones of those who have lost someone to COVID-19.  I urge all of you to consider taking precautions to protect your loved ones.  We are all in this together.

DURBIN TO MCCONNELL: DON’T HOLD COVID-19 RELIEF HOSTAGE OVER LIABILITY IMMUNITY FOR CORPORATIONS 
As cases and infections surge, Congress has been unable to pass additional COVID-19 relief since the spring.  Senate Majority Leader McConnell has refused to negotiate for months and the American people are suffering because of his inaction.    It’s time for Congress to step up to the plate.  For the past several weeks, I have joined a group of Senators from both sides of the aisle—Democrats and Republicans—working on a bipartisan COVID-19 emergency relief package.   Our work has led to a $908 billion plan, a balanced framework that will help break the gridlock we’ve found ourselves in over the past months.  It includes funding for state and local governments, unemployment insurance, small businesses, vaccine distribution and COVID-19 testing, health care providers, housing and education assistance, and more. It’s not everything I wanted, but it reflects an honest compromise.    The bipartisan proposal should get a day on the floor in the House and Senate.  None of us want to go home for the holidays and turn our backs on those who desperately need our help.  I hope Leader McConnell will finally put politics aside to help the American people during this moment of crisis.   Sincerely,   U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL)

THE SCALISE CAPITOL REPORT
 
Dear Friends, 
 
As 2020 comes to an end, I wanted to provide an update on several accomplishments from this past year that will benefit Louisiana’s First Congressional District, including critical COVID-19 relief.
 
If you would like to continue receiving these updates, please sign up for my newsletter and visit my website, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook pages.
 
COVID-19 Relief
 
COVID-19 Vaccine Arrives in Louisiana
 
Thanks to President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine has been delivered in record time.
 
This week, the first shipments of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine arrived in Louisiana and have already been adminstered to several frontline healthcare workers, and nursing home and long-term care facility residents and staff. The state expects to receive more doses weekly once additional COVID-19 vaccine candidates are approved. As I receive more information on the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine, I will continue to provide updates on vaccine distribution in Louisiana.
 
COVID-19 Relief
 
As Ranking Member of the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis, I’ve had a front row seat to the largest relief effort in American history. While there’s still more to do, our work on legislation such as the CARES Act, including the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), has supported countless American small businesses, thousands of jobs, and our healthcare providers:
	•	The CARES Act – the most impactful relief package providing direct economic assistance and $100 billion to support healthcare providers. This includes over $2 billion in Provider Relief for 6,313 Louisiana Health Care Providers.  
	•	The Paycheck Protection Program – a nearly $350 billion program to provide eight weeks of cash-flow assistance to small businesses, helping workers remain employed and allowing small businesses to stay afloat. In Louisiana alone, 78,866 businesses received over $7 billion in PPP funding.
As Congress finalizes additional COVID-19 relief, please visit my website or sign up for my newsletter for specific details when they are available.
 
Fighting for Louisiana’s First Congressional District
 
Securing Critical Resources for Southeast Louisiana
 
The House recently passed the Water Resources Development Act of 2020 (WRDA), which includes provisions I added that will strengthen flood protection and improve the navigation projects essential for Louisiana’s economy and America’s maritime industry. I'm proud to have secured authorizations in this bill that will:
	•	Protect Louisiana families from being forced to pay bloated tabs when critical flood protection and coastal restoration projects aren’t delivered by the Army Corps of Engineers in a timely and affordable manner.  
	•	Deepen Baptiste Collette, the Houma Navigation Canal, and Port Fourchon Belle Pass, all of which will strengthen Louisiana’s position as a leading export state and a top producer of our nation's oil and natural gas.  
	•	Authorize a study for the Tangipahoa River that will produce necessary solutions for flooding in the region.
Strengthening Louisiana Infrastructure & Coastal Restoration
 
This year’s record-breaking hurricane season in Louisiana serves as a stark reminder about the importance of investing in hurricane and flood protection, as well as coastal restoration efforts. An investment in Louisiana infrastructure is an investment in the American economy, and I’m glad we were able to secure major progress on the following projects that are so important to our state and nation:
	•	LA Highway 1 – Just this year, we witnessed multiple closures of LA Highway 1 after it became impassable due to severe flooding from various hurricanes and tropical storms. Along with being a major hurricane evacuation route, LA 1 provides sole access to Port Fourchon and the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP). In June, I was proud to work alongside the Trump Administration to secure $135 million in federal funding to elevate LA Highway 1. This is a major victory for the protection of Louisiana families and for safeguarding access to our nation’s oil and natural gas supply.  
	•	Widening I-12 – Earlier this year, construction began on the I-12 expansion in St. Tammany Parish. Widening I-12 in St. Tammany Parish has been a high priority of mine, and in 2018 I worked closely with the Trump Administration to secure a $25 million BUILD Grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation to help complete this vital project that will improve safety, significantly reduce traffic, and boost economic growth throughout Southeast Louisiana.  
	•	Coastal Restoration – In February, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced $85 million to deepen the Mississippi River to 50 feet, increasing Louisiana’s ability to move more commerce through the Port of New Orleans. This critical project also provides a dual benefit of rebuilding Louisiana’s vanishing coastline. Deepening the river will give the state the ability to take that sediment and use it to rebuild our coast, increasing lifesaving flood protection.  
	◦	In March, the Trump Administration announced that Louisiana will receive $124.6 million in revenue sharing funding as required by the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (GOMESA). This critical funding allows us to restore our coast and protect families and small businesses from future storms, as well as protecting the vital infrastructure important to our entire nation.
It is an honor to represent you in Congress. If you would like to continue receiving these updates, please sign up for my newsletter and visit my website, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook pages.
 
God Bless

4/12/21 21:12,RE: Serving You,"Dear Friend,

Happy Friday, and I hope you had a great week! I was home this week in California’s 39th District, working hard for you. Here are the highlights:

Helping to Reunite Korean Americans with Family in North Korea


On Thursday, I helped introduce a bipartisan resolution with Rep. Karen Bass (CA-37) calling on the United States and North Korea to reunite divided Korean American family members who have been separated from each other for over 60 years.

Since the end of the Korean War, an estimated 100,000 Korean Americans have not seen or heard from their loved ones in North Korea. As a Korean American, I understand and have great empathy for Korean Americans’ continued separation from their families in North Korea, and I have been pushing to reunite these family members since before serving in Congress. Time is running out to reunite these war-torn families, which is why I am proud to help lead this bipartisan resolution to right this terrible wrong.

Funding the 57/60 Confluence Project




CA-39 knows well the 57/60, which merges together in Diamond Bar close to the borders of Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino Counties and is rated the third-worst congested freeway segment in California and sixth-worst in the U.S.

I led a bipartisan letter with Rep. Grace Napolitano and members of California’s Congressional Delegation to Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg urging approval of $30 million in grant funding to support the State Route 57/60 Confluence Chokepoint Relief program. This grant would support the construction of additional travel lanes, on-ramps, and off-ramps and repairs. Learn more. 

Visiting Pulmuone in Fullerton


Pulmuone is a food manufacturing company headquartered in Fullerton. After originating in South Korea after World War II, Pulmuone opened its doors in the U.S. in 1991 and has grown to own more than 75 percent of the nation’s tofu market. Besides tofu, the company produces ramen, pasta dishes and sauces to be sold nationwide.

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Pulmuone has partnered with the Korean Medical Association to provide COVID testing for employees, and has spent company funds to provide PPE, rapid tests, facility disinfection and sick leave to employees. With the precautions they’ve taken, Pulmuone has avoided outbreaks among its employees. I enjoyed learning about their work to distribute food safely during the pandemic, create new jobs and their promotion of healthy eating in our community. 

Securing Our Border and Fixing our Broken Immigration System


Now more than ever, Republicans and Democrats need to come together to solve the problems our country is facing. I joined A Starting Point to discuss our nation’s broken immigration system and how Congress can come together to secure the border and create a legal, fair and considerate immigration system. 


Talking With Buena Park Middle School Students




Every year, the SIFMA Foundation’s Capitol Hill Challenge invites public school students nationwide to participate in an online educational competition to promote personal finance and economics. Students manage a hypothetical $100,000 online portfolio and invest in real stocks, bonds, mutual funds and cash.

I joined students and teachers from Buena Park Junior High School to speak about the importance of financial education and personal finance. As a mom and small business owner, I know the importance of personal finance and enjoyed sharing my experience and knowledge with this great group of students.

Honoring Gold Star Spouses Day


We must always remember the tremendous sacrifices made not only by those who answer the call to serve our nation's uniform, but also their families. This Monday was Gold Star Spouses Day, when we honor and thank the loved ones of our heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice to protect our nation. Our words are never enough to thank our service members and their loved ones for their sacrifice.

Congressional Art Competition


Calling all CA-39 young artists! All high school students are invited to participate in the 2021 Congressional Art Competition for a chance to have their work displayed in the U.S. Capitol for one year. The deadline is Monday, April 26, 2021 at 5pm PT. Visit my website HERE to learn more. 

COVID-19

I am committed to helping California's 39th District get through the COVID-19 pandemic better than before. As we work to safely reopen communities and get people back to work, I will do all that I can to make sure my constituents receive the relief you deserve.

Vaccines are currently available for CA-39 residents ages 50+.

2/21/21 11:01,Investing in Infrastructure,"Enews Sign Up  |  Visit My Website  |  View Online 

  

Dear Friend,  During this week's winter weather, my prayers have been with everyone who is out of power and affected by the cold, ice, and snow. The winter storms and resulting power outages shed light on the need for our country to rethink its energy infrastructure. We must prioritize reliable forms of baseload energy, like coal and natural gas, to keep the power on and heat our homes, hospitals, and businesses.
 
I will continue to combat federal regulations that kneecap our energy sector's ability to operate during extreme conditions. Rather than limiting strong baseload American energy with bureaucratic red tape, we must invest in innovative, new technology to modernize and bolster our energy supply so that it's not only more efficient, but also more reliable. Doing so is vital to ensuring emergencies like those of this week never happen again.
 
Additionally this week, Toyota announced a $210 million investment to upgrade existing engine production lines and create a third shift, which will bring 100 new jobs to the Buffalo plant. I thank Toyota for this welcomed investment in rural America and for their commitment to employing hardworking West Virginians. Together, we are rebuilding and restrengthening our economy as we continue to crush COVID-19!

12/4/20 20:59,The months ahead,"December 4, 2020
 
 
Dear Friend,
 
This evening, state health officials announced nearly 800 new COVID-19 infections, which includes previously unreported cases from earlier this week. This means that we saw a new single-day record in New Hampshire on Wednesday, with 783 cases. There are now over 4,700 active cases of coronavirus in the state. Sadly, eight new deaths were also reported tonight – my thoughts are with the families and loved ones of the 552 Granite Staters who have died as a result of COVID-19.
 
Community transmission is increasing and cases are continuing to rise here in NH and across the country. While this is troubling information for all of us, there is a light at the end of the tunnel. An effective COVID-19 vaccine is on the horizon. We expect health care workers and some of the most vulnerable members of our communities to begin receiving vaccinations this year and a COVID-19 vaccine should be available to everyone by spring.
 
The next few months will be difficult, but we will get through this together. We need to accept that our holidays will be different this year and plan to celebrate virtually or with members of our own household. With an effective vaccine right around the corner, it’s more important than ever that we follow the guidance of our public health officials and take steps to stop the spread and save lives. For guidance from the CDC on how to keep yourself and those around you safe, click here.
 
 
 

 
 
 
An Update from Washington
 
 
 

 
 
I was back in Washington this week working to bring together a bipartisan group of members from the House and the Senate for a COVID relief package. This is critically important—case numbers are skyrocketing, and I want to make sure that all Granite Staters have access to the health care they need, that the vaccine receives adequate funding for equitable distribution in New Hampshire and across the country, and that we have an economic plan for when the vaccine is widely distributed to re-open our economy.
 
But we have to be patient—it’s so important that you wear your mask, keep your distance, and if you do get together with people outside of your household, make sure it’s outdoors. Thanks for everything that you’re doing, hang in there, and take care.
 
 
 
Addressing the Economic and Health Consequences of the COVID-19 Crisis
 
 
 

  
 Speaking on the House floor this morning to call for immediate passage of a COVID relief bill. Watch here.
 
 
In New Hampshire and across the country, there's an urgent need for a bold response to the COVID-19 pandemic to address both the economic and health consequences of this crisis. It’s been over six months since we passed the HEROES Act in the House to provide comprehensive relief to Granite Staters and Americans across the country, and Senate Republicans still have failed to act. I’ve spoken to small business owners, struggling individuals, health care providers, first responders as well as local leaders and the message is clear: the time for action is now. I'm pleased to see a bipartisan framework that will provide relief for American families, and I hope this step will pave the way for passage of a comprehensive package this month.
 
 
 
Being There for Our Loved Ones During the Pandemic
 
 For months, COVID-19 has disrupted our lives and separated us from one another as we have taken extraordinary, necessary steps to prevent the spread of the virus and save lives. However, social distance doesn’t need to mean social isolation — there are many ways to be there for our loved ones who might be struggling at this difficult time. Experts say we can start by paying attention, checking in regularly, and normalizing conversations about mental health. For more information on how to talk to your loved ones when you are concerned about their mental health, click here.
 
 
 
Restoring Trust and Credibility to Our Nation's Public Health Response
 
 Dr. Anthony Fauci is one of our nation’s — and the world’s — most trusted and well-respected infectious disease experts, and I am thrilled that he will be joining the Biden-Harris Administration as chief medical adviser to President-elect Biden. Dr. Fauci has served as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) for over three and a half decades, throughout six presidential administrations. The incoming Biden-Harris Administration is building a stellar team of doctors and scientists who will be ready to hit the ground running on day one to address the COVID-19 public health crisis and restore trust and credibility to our nation's pandemic response.
 
 
 
Making Graduate Education More Accessible
 
 
 

  
Speaking at the Annual Meeting of the Council of Graduate Schools
 
It’s an honor to receive the Council of Graduate Schools (CGS)’s 2020 Congressional Champion Award and it was great to join their 60th Annual Meeting. I’m a proud advocate for making graduate education more accessible — that’s why I introduced the Expanding Access to Graduate Education Act to open the doors of graduate education to more Americans and provide opportunities for them to get ahead. I will continue my efforts to ensure every American can access the education and job training they need to thrive in the 21st century economy. 
 
 
 
Working Across the Aisle to Protect Our Communities from Toxic PFAS Chemicals
 
 We know that PFAS chemicals pose a serious threat to the health and wellbeing of communities in New Hampshire and across the country, and we must take action now to protect Americans from these dangerous forever substances. Today, I joined 58 of my colleagues in sending a bipartisan letter to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees in support of robust funding in the Fiscal Year 2021 spending bill to protect communities from harmful PFAS chemicals. 
 
 
 
Marking the 50th Anniversary of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
 
 
 

 
This week marked the 50th anniversary of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Established in 1970, the EPA has been dedicated to protecting and preserving our public health, environment, and natural resources for half a century. As we look to the future of this vital agency, we must work to ensure the EPA upholds its original promise to the American people and preserves clean water, breathable air, and a hazard free environment for generations to come.
 
 
 
News You Can Use
 
 
Due to the pandemic, the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is experiencing much higher package volumes nationwide, despite it being only the first week of December. Therefore, USPS encourages people to mail early this year for the holidays, and to order online as early as possible if they want inbound packages to arrive on time. For more information on USPS holiday shipping and deadlines, click here. 
 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, access to affordable, quality health coverage is more important than ever. Enrollment in healthcare.gov is open NOW through December 15th. If you need coverage or want to make changes to your existing plan for 2021, visit healthcare.gov or call 1-800-318-2596.
 
 

 
Medicare’s Open Enrollment period is also happening now. From now until December 7th, you can enroll in Medicare health and drug plans. Visit medicare.gov for more information.

COVID-19 infections are rising rapidly in New Hampshire and across the country. While it’s important to remember that many people who get the virus never develop symptoms, you can protect yourself and your loved ones by understanding how the virus spreads, recognizing common symptoms and warning signs, and by taking the recommended precautions. 
 
As always, the CDC and the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services are the best resources to turn to during the COVID-19 public health emergency. If you are sick, stay home and call your health care provider. If you live in NH and have questions about coronavirus, dial 211 or visit CDC.gov for more information.
 
To stay updated on my work in Congress and around the Granite State, as well as for important information and resources, like my page on Facebook and follow me on Twitter. 
 
Have a fun and safe weekend, and don’t forget to wear a mask when you are in public!
 
Sincerely,
 
Annie

Water Management That Benefits Central Washington


Yesterday I introduced H.R. 2979 to make public water projects eligible for low-interest, longer-term federal loans from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 

The WIFIA Improvement Act would allow water projects with longer useful lifecycles to receive Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act (WIFIA) financing for 55-year loan terms instead of the current 35-year loan terms, thereby lowering the capital costs for such projects. 
 
Federal water projects play a significant role in our way of life throughout Central Washington. Removing barriers to securing federal financing for the much-needed repair and maintenance of these projects is imperative. This bill will help our local water managers and operators finance long-term projects, enabling us to ensure long-term success for all who rely on this infrastructure for clean water and irrigation in rural communities.

Governor Inslee Failing to Listen to Local Concerns


Despite the very best efforts of local leaders to collaborate with Governor Inslee's office to maintain health and safety protocols, the 2021 Tri-Cities Water Follies and Columbia Cup were cancelled this week. 

Shutting down an outdoor event that is taking place months in the future is a slap in the face to the local leaders, healthcare workers, and business owners who have worked for over a year to keep our communities healthy and distribute vaccines to thousands of Tri-Cities residents.

The loss of over $3 million to our local economy is one that will be deeply felt by our businesses that are struggling to recover, and I am disappointed that Governor Inslee's office was unwilling to work with our local officials to make this outdoor event safe for our communities.

Demanding a Seat at the Table


For months, Rep. Mike Simpson (R-ID) has been speaking with northwest members of Congress about his sweeping dam-breaching proposal, touting transparency and an open process. 

He said it was simply a “legislative concept” for the Northwest delegation to consider. However, a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) publication released this week reveals in-depth coordination between the offices of Rep. Simpson and Oregon Governor Kate Brown, and it is clear Rep. Simpson is actively seeking to put the proposal into law.  

We already knew that breaching the dams threatens our way of life in the Pacific Northwest, but the release of these public records proves our constituents are being left out of what should be an open and transparent process.

National Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women


On Wednesday, I introduced a resolution designating May 5, 2021 as the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Native Women and Girls. I also joined community leaders in Toppenish to commemorate the lives of those lost and recognize that we must continue to work to end the crisis of MMIW. 


While Native Americans make up 2% of our state’s population, Native Women account for 7% of our state’s reported missing women. There are currently 32 open cases of MMIW on or near the Yakama Nation reservation alone. 


Despite these sad and staggering numbers in our community, the closest Cold Case Task Force Office is currently located in Billings, Montana. Establishing a Cold Case Task Force Office in Yakima is imperative if we want to keep moving forward in addressing this crisis. 
 
We must continue to take up the banner for those who no longer are able to. They deserve answers, and I will continue working to deliver them.

Stability for Local Organic Growers


Last week, I introduced the Continuous Improvement and Accountability in Organic Standards Act (CIAO Act), to improve the federal process for the oversight of organic standards. 

Central Washington organic growers should not be kept in regulatory limbo. I'm sponsoring the Continuous Improvement and Accountability In Organic Standards Act so that USDA is required to clear the backlog of recommendations to improve our organic standards. 

As a Co-Chair of the House Organic Caucus, I represent the highest number of USDA-certified organic farmers, ranchers, processors, and distributors in Washington state and the fourth highest in the country. It's imperative that we provide our organic growers certainty and help spark further innovation and improvement within the organic industry.

A Solution to President Biden's Border Crisis



I joined the Bipartisan Policy Center's ""Under the Dome"" podcast to talk about my legislation, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, which will provide a legal, reliable workforce for our agriculture industry. 
 
It will also help address the ongoing crisis at our southern border. With record breaking numbers of illegal border crossings, we must work to enforce our laws and disincentivize illegal immigration. The Farm Workforce Modernization Act is one way to do so. 

Listen to the Podcast






It is an honor and a privilege to serve you in Congress. To stay up to date on how I am working to represent Central Washington, I encourage you to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. You can also find regular updates on my website.

Friend,

Happy Mother's Day (yesterday) to all the moms out there! I hope you had a great weekend celebrating the special holiday with loved ones. Last week I was in the district and met with local leaders and constituents to hear about all the great things happening in our community. Thanks for reading this week's Monday Message!

CALHOUN COUNTY SHERIFF STEVE HINKLEY TESTIFIES AT HOUSE HOMELAND SECURITY SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING: 
﻿""Stakeholder Perspectives on Addressing Migration Push Factors""

As the Ranking Member of the House Homeland Security Committee Subcommittee on Oversight, Management, and Accountability, I invited Calhoun County Sheriff Steve Hinkley to testify as the minority witness during last week's hearing. The hearing was especially relevant as we discussed the current crisis at our southern border and its impact on West Michigan. The Biden Administration's reckless rhetoric and policies have encouraged hundreds of thousands of migrants to put themselves and their families in danger. Due to the border crisis, migrant children are being housed in MI-03 and our local law enforcement is being asked to perform additional services without proper funding. Read more here.

Calhoun County Sheriff Steve Hinkley's opening remarks 


I asked Sheriff Hinkley to discuss some of the challenges his department is facing related to the 100 unaccompanied migrant children housed at Starr Commonwealth in Albion. Read the full transcript here. 

STANDING UP FOR WEST MICHIGAN VETERANS

﻿Last week I introduced the Veterans Improved Access to Care Act with Rep. Jason Crow (D-CO). This bipartisan bill would establish a pilot program to expedite the onboarding of licensed medical professionals at understaffed VA facilities and require the Secretary of the VA to submit a detailed report on how to best streamline the VA's hiring process. This legislation has real potential to improve access to and quality of care for West Michigan's veteran population, and I am proud to lead this effort in the House. Read more here.

REPEALING OUTDATED AUMFs

I joined Representatives Mike Gallagher (R-WI), Abigail Spanberger (D-VA), and Jared Golden (D-ME) in penning a joint op-ed on the importance of Congress reclaiming its war powers and repealing outdated and inactive AUMFs. Earlier this year, I supported H.R. 256, a bill to repeal the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) Against Iraq Resolution of 2002. Read our op-ed here. 

THANK YOU, POLICE OFFICERS!


In honor of National Police Week, this morning I stopped by the Hastings Police Department and dropped off some Van's donuts. Thank you to our law enforcement professionals for keeping our communities safe! I encourage you to thank members of our law enforcement community this week.

MI-03 VISITS IN REVIEW




﻿I had a great meeting with Dr. Bill Pink, the President of Grand Rapids Community College, last week. We discussed their new program available to graduating high school students that teaches skills and helps prepare them for college. Learn more about this program here. 


I had the honor speaking at the Eagle Scouts Building Character Celebration in Grand Rapids. I'm proud of these young adults' efforts and look forward to seeing the great things they will accomplish in the future! Watch the full ceremony here. 





﻿I toured the Kids Food Basket and heard about all the ways they are working to alleviate hunger and improve nutrition for children in MI-03. I’m looking forward to my next visit! Learn more about this organization here. 


Last week I met with staff from Kellogg Community College in Battle Creek to discuss their TRIO program. Kimberly, a graduate of the program, joined us and spoke about how TRIO and its support network helped pave the way for her to attend Western Michigan University and pursue her dreams! Find more information about the TRIO program here.

Weekly Wrap-Up with 
Congressman Byron Donalds

This past week was a historic week for our nation. America celebrated Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s life, and legacy witnessed a peaceful transition of power, and began a new chapter in our nations' history book. The Biden Administration has taken many concerning first steps that do the opposite of uniting our divided country. It is deeply disappointing to see the administration taking steps to overturn the America First policies of the previous president, including: halting border wall construction, rejoining the WHO and the Paris Climate Accord, killing jobs by ending the Keystone XL pipeline, and freezing a measure to lower the cost of life-saving insulin. 
 
As outlined in the Constitution, our three branches of government's leadership will change, but our responsibility as members of the legislative branch does not. I am committed to serving in this legislative body as a conservative with unwavering beliefs in God, our Constitution, and the American Dream.    Continue reading for highlights on this past week in Congress.
 

 
 
Inauguration of President Joe Biden
 
Inauguration Day is a historic moment for our country and is a time when all of us united around our shared identity as Americans. Throughout our treasured history, we have witnessed the peaceful transition fo power as President George Washington envisioned. I feel that attendance at this historical event truly honors our great Republic. 
 


 

 
 
Florida Vaccinates One Million People
 

This past week, because of Governor DeSantis' strong leadership, Florida just vaccinated its one-millionth patient in the fight against COVID-19. I am proud of Florida's continuous record of innovation and resilience. Congratulations to all of our leaders and healthcare workers that made this impressive milestone happen.

Florida Delegation Calls on Operation Warp Speed Officials to Increase State’s Vaccine Allotment
 
In Florida, we are following the science while allowing Floridians to safely go about their daily lives. We are home to millions of seniors & seasonal visitors, which creates an increased demand for vaccines. For this reason, I'm requesting to increase the vaccine allocation. Signed letter, here.
 

 
 
District Updates
 
Last week, the Southwest Florida community was honored to host Governor Ron DeSantis in the city of Cape Coral to announce all Publix grocery stores and Publix pharmacies in Lee County will begin offering COVID-19 vaccines. Throughout this pandemic, the Governor's Administration has consistently prioritized #SeniorsFirst. 
 
I'm thankful for Governor DeSantis' leadership in forming this innovative partnership!
 

 
 
In the Media
 
Unity and healing in the days ahead will require steady leadership from Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). They must work with Republicans, not just Democrats, to put forward an inclusiveness agenda representing those in middle America, not only New York City and San Francisco.

On Thursday, I joined Fox & Friends First to discuss the Inauguration, the GOP's future, and the Biden Administration's early executive actions. The full interview, here.
 

 

 
On Tuesday, I joined the Chris Salcedo Show on Newsmax last week and discussed how the Republican Party can still lead through strength and stay committed to our principles despite serving in Congress's minority. Watch below! 
 
 

 
 

 
 
Honoring the Life and Legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
 
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the midst of challenging & controversial times stood strong—using peace & the power of words to fight for equality for all. His movement enabled every American, including myself, access to the American Dream, regardless of race.
 
 

 

 
  
 
Anniversary of Roe v Wade
 

This past, the nation saw the 48th anniversary of Roe v Wade. I ask Americans to join me in taking a moment of silence for the more than 63M innocent lives lost since this ruling in 73'. Every life is valuable, from conception to natural death & I will fight to protect the life of every unborn child.

Then-State Senator Cohen with his parents, Genevieve and Dr. Morris Cohen, and Vice President Mondale.   
Dear Friend, 
This week, I watched justice done as a Minneapolis jury convicted a former police officer in the death of George Floyd, but work remains to be done. In my statement about the verdict, I noted that three provisions I authored are in the House-passed George Floyd Justice in Policing Act now awaiting action in the Senate. I also chaired my Judiciary subcommittee’s hearing on voter suppression and repairing the Voting Rights Act; remembered former Vice President Walter Mondale, a great public servant and progressive leader; joined my Congressional colleagues in writing to the Small Business Administration (SBA) urging quick implementation of the Shuttered Venues Operators grants I voted for in a coronavirus relief bill in December; voted to make the District of Columbia the 51st state; announced significant grants to the University of Memphis and to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital; and offered a health tip. Keep reading and follow me on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to see what I’m doing as it happens.

Seeing Justice Done in the George Floyd Case and Beyond 
On Tuesday, like much of the country, I awaited the verdict in the George Floyd murder case in Minneapolis and was pleased to see justice done. The trial and peaceful protests over the past 11 months are yet another reminder that the police accountability and transparency provisions of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act passed in the House must be taken up and passed in the Senate and become law. I authored and introduced three provisions in the bill – the National Statistics on Deadly Force Transparency Act, the Police Creating Accountability by Making Effective Recording Available (CAMERA) Act and the Police Training and Independent Review Act – to provide the public with greater confidence in the fairness of law enforcement, particularly in communities of color. We still have much work to do. 
Presiding Over Hearing on the Voting Rights Act 
On Thursday, as Chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties, I presided at a hearing on “Oversight of the Voting Rights Act: The Evolving Landscape of Voting Discrimination.” See my release, including my opening statement and questioning of hearing witnesses, here. 
Remembering the Late Vice President Walter Mondale 
 
On Monday, we learned that former Vice President Walter Mondale had passed. Mondale, who was also a U.S. Senator, was a dedicated progressive leader and stood up for civil rights and other important causes. He will be long remembered as a great American. The Vice President sent me this note when I served as the Vice President of the Tennessee Constitutional Convention. 
Writing to the SBA about Shuttered Venues Grant Program 
This week, I joined a bipartisan, bicameral letter to the Small Business Administration (SBA) encouraging prompt action to distribute grants to eligible entertainment venues that have been shuttered by the pandemic as quickly as possible. As evictions loom and creditors demand repayment, these loans will be lifelines to clubs, theaters, zoos and other businesses. See the letter here. 
Voting to Make the District of Columbia the 51st State 
On Thursday, I was proud to cast a vote for District of Columbia statehood. Washington, D.C., with about 712,000 residents, has a larger population than either Wyoming or Vermont, and more people than every Congressional district in the states of Rhode Island, West Virginia, Nebraska, New Hampshire and Maine. It’s time to make D.C. a state so that these U.S. citizens have representation in Congress. 
Announcing Grant to the University of Memphis 
On Tuesday, I announced a significant grant to the University of Memphis to study how best to eliminate the stigma of HIV. See that release here. 
Announcing Cancer Research Grant to St. Jude 
On Wednesday, I announced that one of the National Institutes of Health that is focused on the health of children has made a major grant to St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital to study the genetics of families with blood cancer. See that release here. 
Weekly Health Tip 
I was pleased to tour the COVID-19 vaccination center set up in the Pipkin Building on the old Mid-South Fairgrounds earlier this month. But what I’ve heard since then prompts this week’s tip: The increased capacity is under-utilized, and there are no lines, but the surge in vaccinations supported by FEMA and the military personnel is scheduled to end May 17. If you haven’t yet received your free vaccination, it’s time to do so. Many people are in and out within 15 to 20 minutes, which includes the period where you must be observed for any reaction. As Spring arrives and we yearn to be out among our friends and families, being vaccinated will make it safer and more comfortable for everyone. Do it for yourself, your family, friends, and community. To make an appointment, go to https://covid19.memphistn.gov/ or call (901) 222-SHOT (7468). 
Quote of the Week 
 
Then-Vice President Cohen of the Tennessee Constitutional Convention in 1977 with the Vice President. 
“I’m a liberal or a progressive. I didn’t use the ‘liberal’ word much, because I thought it carried too much baggage. But my whole life, I worked on the idea that government can be an instrument for social progress. We need that progress. Fairness requires it.” – Former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, who died Monday at 93. 
As always, I remain.Most sincerely,

12/20/20 10:02,This Week on Buddy's Briefing,"THIS WEEK ON BUDDY'S BRIEFING

This week, Congress passed another short-term extension to federal government funding to allow more time to reach an agreement on next year's federal funding bills and a COVID-19 package. Federal funding now expires at midnight tonight. We discuss where we are in negotiations, the first shipment of the COVID-19 vaccine to Georgia, and more in this episode of Buddy's Briefing.

COVID-19 VACCINE

As I have mentioned before, I am participating in a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine trial in Savannah. It’s a double-blind study so I didn’t know if I got the vaccine or a placebo, and the doctors and nurses didn’t know either. 

This week, I learned that I received the vaccine.

Having received the vaccine in the trial, I am absolutely confident that it is safe and effective. I encourage all Americans to get the vaccine when it’s available.

Click here to see when I learned I received the vaccine.

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCXCIII

Monday, December 14, 2020: After a busy weekend that included meetings with Sen. David Perdue (R-GA) and Sen. Kelly Loeffler (R-GA) in Savannah and in Brunswick, as well as a Doctors Caucus conference call on Sunday to discuss last minute negotiations on surprise medical billing (SMB), I’m back at my COVID-19 clinical trial for blood draws to see how my antibodies have been producing. 

Rep. Carter at the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine trial
As I have stated before, these clinical trials are a double-blind study meaning that I don’t know whether I am receiving the actual vaccine or a placebo.  My doctors and nurses assisting me are also unaware of which one I have received and therefore we are all proceeding as if I have received the vaccine.  Because the Pfizer vaccine received an emergency use authorization (EUA) from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) last week, the vaccine will be sent out this week and available for administration.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended that nursing home patients and workers as well as front line health care workers be given the vaccine first.  Because those of us participating in the clinical trials would like to get the vaccine if we didn’t get it during the clinical trials, the codes will be unblinded soon to let us know whether we have gotten the vaccine or not.  Obviously, this is exciting news for all of us.  Afterwards, I head to Glynn County and during the drive, I join in on our daily all-staff conference call as well as an Energy and Commerce (E&C) Committee member conference call where we discuss legislation from the Committee that will likely be included in the budget agreement that is currently being negotiated.  Once in Glynn County, I head to St. Simons Island where I am the guest speaker for the monthly meeting of the Golden Isles Republican Women’s luncheon. 

Rep. Carter speaks to the Golden Isles Republican Women's luncheon
After a delightful visit with this great group, I head to our Brunswick office where I have a podcast interview with the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) where we discuss the Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) recent ruling in Rutledge v. Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA) that federal ERISA laws do not preempt Arkansas law.  Next, I have another podcast interview on the same subject with the American Pharmacists Association (APhA), before meeting with constituents concerning tax issues.  After a visit with the Coastal Regional Commission in Darien to hear about how they are making good use of CARES funds, I head back to Savannah and during the drive I have a phone call with Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr to discuss election issues.  Once back in Savannah, I head to our district office where I host a telephone town hall where I entertain constituent questions and solicit their input on current issues.

Tuesday, December 15, 2020:  I’m up bright and early this morning as I have a live virtual interview at 5:15 a.m. on Fox and Friends where we discuss the COVID-19 vaccine as well as the Georgia Senatorial runoffs.  A link to my interview can be found here. A few hours later, I have a live radio interview with my good friends on the world famous Butch and Bob Show in Jesup as we discuss current events in Washington.  Next, I head to the Georgia Ports Authority (GPA) annex in Garden City where I am honored to speak to the Savannah Maritime Association to bring them up to date on issues in Washington, particularly those impacting our port. 

Rep. Carter joins Governor Kemp as some of the first Georgians receive the COVID-19 vaccine
Later in the afternoon, I join Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Kathleen Toomey for a press conference at the Department of Public Health (DPH) in Savannah where the first shipment of the COVID-19 vaccine in the State of Georgia has arrived and where the first health care workers in the state receive the vaccine.  This is truly a momentous occasion as Operation Warp Speed (OWS) has proven to be a great success and vaccines are now being administered less than a year from the beginning of the pandemic in the U.S. 

Wednesday, December 16, 2020:  After an early morning flight to Washington that includes a delay in Charlotte where we sit on the tarmac for 2 hours due to mechanical problems, I’m back in my office on Capitol Hill.  After a Doctors Caucus conference call with Centers for Medicaid and Medicare Services (CMS) Administrator Seema Verma, where we discuss pending issues that our caucus is working on, I join in on our daily all-staff conference call.  Next, I head to the House Chamber where I pay tribute to WTOC-TV news anchor Dawn Baker, who was one of the first volunteers in Savannah for the COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials.  A link to my tribute can be found here.  Once back in my office, I have a phone interview with the Atlanta Journal Constitution (AJC) to discuss the amicus brief that I signed onto last week concerning a case before the SCOTUS.  Later, I head back to the House Chamber for our first vote series of the week.

Thursday, December 17, 2020:  After our daily all-staff conference call, I join in on a GOP Conference call where leadership brings us up to date on the latest budget and relief package negotiations.  Although it appears an agreement is in place regarding the budget, the relief package is not settled and both sides are hoping to package the two together as one for voting purposes.  Next, I have an E&C member conference call with Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar as he brings us up to date on OWS and shares with us the good news of the vaccine now being available. 

Rep. Carter recognizes Tom McCall on the House floor
Later, I head to the House Chamber where I pay tribute to my good friend and former Georgia State House colleague, Tom McCall from Elbert County.  Tom has recently been elected President of the Georgia Farm Bureau.  A link to my tribute can be found here.  Next, I head over to the Library of Congress Madison Building where I record a Christmas video before heading back to the House Chamber for our first and only vote of the day.  Once back in my office, I participate in an ethics virtual training class that includes a vigorous post-test.

Friday, December 18, 2020:  After our daily all-staff conference call this morning, I spend most of the day in a hurry up and wait mode.  Our schedule is very fluid today as negotiations on the budget and relief package continue with the government scheduled to shut down at midnight tonight unless we extend it with legislative action.  Later, I head to the House Chamber where l pay tribute to Glenn Deibert, President of Coastal Pines Technical College, who will be retiring soon after many years of service.  A link to my tribute can be found here.  Afterwards, we have our first vote series of the day as negotiations on the dual package containing the budget and COVID-19 relief package continues to be negotiated.  Next, I head outside to the western side of the Capitol where I film this week’s edition of Buddy’s Briefing in front of the Capitol Christmas Tree. 

Rep. Carter learns he received the COVID-19 vaccine in the Pfizer trial
Once back in my office, I have a phone call with the nurse director of the clinical trial that I am participating in with the COVID-19 vaccine.  Because the Pfizer vaccine is now available, they have agreed to unblind my study and let me know whether I received the vaccine or a placebo.  A link to the video detailing the call can be found here. Later in the day, we have a vote to extend the current Continuing Resolution (CR) to 11:59 p.m. Sunday night in order to give more time for negotiations on the budget and COVID-19 relief package.

Week in Review


 
DOJ Must Investigative NYS’s Disastrous Nursing Home Policy  
 
New York State’s handling of nursing home deaths represents a massive breach in public trust. Hundreds of families across New York State lost loved ones as a direct result of the State’s disastrous nursing home policy. Reporting now shows the Cuomo Administration deliberately withheld this critical information from federal authorities. The individuals responsible for perpetuating this coverup must be held accountable, which is why I’m calling on the Department of Justice to open an obstruction of justice investigation into Governor Andrew Cuomo and his administration.

Leading Effort to Ensure Vaccines Reach Underserved Communities in CNY
 
The CDC and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announced they will supply select Federally Qualified Health Center Programs (FQHCs) with COVID-19 vaccines. To ensure vaccines reach underserved communities in Central New York, I urged the agencies to include Syracuse Community Health Center, Inc. and East Hill Medical Center in the program. With a combined 28 locations which serve thousands of underserved Central New Yorkers, both of these community health centers are uniquely positioned to rectify the vaccine disparity in our region.

Sounding the Alarm on Biden’s Immigration Plan
 
The Biden immigration bill makes no substantial improvements to border security and fails to close loopholes in our current immigration system. Protecting the sovereignty of our territorial borders should not be controversial, and yet the President has sought politically-expedient solutions. Most of the ‘border security’ provisions in this proposal require the Department of Homeland Security to develop plans and strategies that have already been required by Congress or already exist. Ultimately, this plan falls flat and reveals the Administration’s true intent of a complete shift toward open borders. As the Lead Republican of the Committee on Homeland Security, I welcome an honest policy discussion about the changes Congress needs to make to secure the border.

Pregnant Workers Fairness Act Reintroduced
 
Simply put, no mother or mother-to-be in this country should have to choose between being a parent and keeping their job. Unfortunately, current federal law lacks adequate protections to ensure pregnant workers are able to remain healthy in the workplace. That’s why, I reintroduced the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. This bipartisan effort puts in place a uniform, fair and familiar framework for employers and will enable women to keep working safely and provide for their families throughout pregnancy.

Update on Sustained Lake Ontario Flood Risks
 
I spoke with the International Joint Commission (IJC) to bring attention to the continued threat flooding poses to communities across Lake Ontario and to discuss their flood mitigation plans for 2021. With water levels on Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, and Erie all above historic averages, significant inflows from those lakes has the potential to exacerbate hazardous conditions on Lake Ontario. I’m continuing to urge the IJC to prioritize the needs of coastal communities in their water level management strategies and requesting that they work closely with our Canadian partners to help move necessary coastal resiliency efforts forward. I remain resolute in my belief that Plan 2014 is not working for our shorelines and that water level management procedures must be reformed to prioritize the needs of our riparian communities.

Legislative Update: Three Bills to Expand Access to Treatment for Mental Illness & Substance Use Disorders
 
In Central New York, we’re seeing the ongoing pandemic contribute to rising rates of mental illness and suicide as well as substance use disorders and overdose deaths. Our community is facing a crisis and we must devote the time, resources, and attention to these issues. In Congress, I’m continuing to prioritize increasing access to mental healthcare and substance use disorder support services amid the ongoing pandemic by reintroducing three meaningful pieces of legislation. My bills would work to expand treatment options in our region and ensure Central New Yorkers of all ages have access to the support they need during these difficult times.

Named to Three Subcommittees Critical to Addressing CNY Infrastructure Needs
 
Infrastructure is an area where I know we can find bipartisan compromise, and I was recently named to the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, the Subcommittee on Aviation, and the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment. Importantly, these subcommittees will allow me to continue working on efforts that support the I-81 rebuild, keep our aviation systems safe, and address our vast water infrastructure needs in Central New York.

Strong Opposition to a Renewed Nuclear Deal with Iran 
 
Under no circumstance can we allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. The previous Administration took strong action to hold Iran accountable for its illicit behavior and rightfully withdrew from the Iran Nuclear Deal. By offering to restart nuclear talks with Iran, the Biden Administration is seeking to placate the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism and failing to prioritize American security interests. This is a time for strength, not weakness. Any move by the Biden Administration to provide sanctions relief to Iran would be a historic mistake that repeats failed appeasement attempts of the past. As Iran continues to target our critical infrastructure and seeks to exert foreign influence in our elections, this Committee will stand strong to combat nation state aggression and protect the homeland.

5/14/21 14:13,Click Here to Learn How Eligible Families Can Save on Internet Bills,"Dear Neighbors,
The Emergency Broadband Benefit (EBB) Program opened this week. It’s a groundbreaking new program that will help eligible families afford their monthly Internet bill. From virtual classrooms to telehealth visits, the pandemic has made access to reliable, high-speed internet more important than ever. That’s why I fought to include this program in the omnibus bill that Congress passed late last year. I encourage anyone who may be struggling right now to see if they qualify for this new program, and then sign up by contacting their internet provider. 
You can go to getemergencybroadband.org to see if you qualify. Eligible families may receive:
	•	Up to a $50/month discount on broadband service and associated equipment rentals
	•	A one-time discount of up to $100 for a laptop, tablet, or desktop computer (with a co-payment of more than $10 but less than $50)
Colleges, universities, and students associated with New Jersey’s 6th Congressional District will receive nearly $210 million in emergency funding under the American Rescue Plan. The funding will help local institutions cope with the severe financial fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and continue serving their students safely. The success of our local colleges and universities is critical to the success of our students and to the strength of our community.

The House of Representatives this week passed 13 bills that invest in our country’s mental health infrastructure. The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the pre-existing mental health care crisis in the United States. That’s why I helped lead passage of these bills that improve mental health care, substance use disorder treatment, and suicide prevention. Read more here
I held a hearing this week with the Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra on the Department’s budget for Fiscal Year 2022. This budget makes investments that improve our nation’s public health preparedness, reduce health inequities, reduce maternal mortality and morbidity, improve mental health, and combat the opioid epidemic. The COVID-19 pandemic laid bare the impacts chronic underfunding of public health has had on our surveillance, preparedness, and response efforts. It is my hope to work with the Biden Administration to ensure rebuilding our public health infrastructure is a key component of any jobs and infrastructure plan. Read more here
I held a hearing this week in my Energy and Commerce Committee on Superfund provisions in my CLEAN Future Act. New Jersey has one of the highest rates of Superfund sites in the country, which is why I’m working to strengthen the Superfund program to clean up the most toxic sites across our country. Investments and improvements to the Superfund program can benefit public health and the environment, reduce environmental injustice, and promote job creation. Read more here
The Colonial Pipeline cyberattack and the ripple effects being felt now across the country are sharp reminders of just how deeply we all rely upon our energy infrastructure every day, and just how crucial it is that we invest in modernizing and protecting it. My Energy and Commerce Committee is the best equipped committee to lead bipartisan cybersecurity solutions, especially to protect our nation’s energy infrastructure and pipelines. That’s why I introduced four bipartisan solutions to secure our critical energy infrastructure this week. Read more here

1/20/21 10:23,"Reminder: My Thoughts on Impeachment, Vaccination for Seniors, and Financial Assistance","January 17, 2021
 

Dear Neighbor, 

Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to call or write to me over the past few days to share their feelings on the sensitive topic of impeachment. I understand many of you feel passionately about this issue.  I released this statement to explain my thoughts on the subject. As I explained in my last newsletter, I was appalled by the violence at the Capitol, the senseless loss of life and destruction of public property that ensued. I am also concerned about reports of more planned attacks in Washington and around the country.  Violence is NEVER justified.  

I have not agreed with many things the President has done and said over the past few weeks. However, the Speaker's politically-motivated impeachment will continue to divide Americans. It further alienates millions of Americans who distrust our political processes, have concerns about the direction of our country and feel that their voices are being silenced. It will only fuel the anger and frustration that already exists.  We need to find common ground and focus on the real challenges that families across our nation are experiencing.  

Aside from this being a counterproductive measure as we try to unite our nation, this reckless action sets a very dangerous precedent for our country. The House voting to impeach the President without listening to eyewitness testimony or reviewing a single piece of evidence is a violation of due process and a significant, undemocratic deviation from past procedures.  Removing a duly elected President from office is a very serious proposition. I am genuinely concerned that this action will make it easier for future leaders to circumvent the will of the people and remove a future President without cause. In October of 2019, Speaker Pelosi herself issued a letter “establishing the procedures for impeachment hearings that were open to the American people, authorizing the disclosure of deposition transcripts, outlining the transfer of evidence to respective committees and setting forth due process rights for the President and his counsel.” Yet, as she rushed to make history in impeaching President Trump for a second time she failed to even give the pretense of creating an impartial process. 

The real work of Congress is not wrapped-up in the headline-dominating stories of the hour, but rather is the business of solving the every-day problems Americans are facing. The long-term success of our country is dependent on our willingness to work together as one team for the greater good. That is my focus as we move forward.  

Continue reading for an overview of important developments that have transpired over the past week. 

Vaccinating Seniors

As your federal representative, my role in the vaccination process has been to facilitate the development, approval and production of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. Based on the principle of federalism and in accordance with the law, each state was responsible for developing and implementing a vaccine distribution plan to meet the targeted needs of prioritized population groups. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) provided guidance to states about which groups it felt should be prioritized in tier one of plans (healthcare workers, those in long-term care facilities and seniors over the age of 65) however, each state had the discretion to develop its plan based on the individual needs of its citizenry. 

I know that vaccination roll-out in our state has been challenging for many, and I have worked closely with state and local officials to share the feedback I’ve received from my constituents. I will continue to do so. I can say that Florida’s distribution plan is a work in progress and that the state continues to improve and expand its efforts. As noted in this article, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department announced some recommended changes last week. As long as we ensure that seniors who have already received their first dose have no delays obtaining their second dose, I am cautiously optimistic about these announced changes. I do believe that pharmacies and community health centers can help expand the number of people who are able to get vaccinated, especially in Florida. I know demand is high among seniors and those with pre-existing health conditions, and I will keep working with state and local leaders to expedite and enhance the processes being used. 

As Florida developed its distribution plan, it prioritized seniors-both those in long-term care facilities and in the general population. To date, more than 350,000 seniors in Florida have been vaccinated. While this is a higher percentage of vaccines going to seniors than in other states, we must do more to ensure all seniors have access to a vaccine. I’m continuing to work with state and local leaders to achieve this goal. 
 

New Developments Last Week

Two local hospital chains began to vaccinate seniors who get their primary healthcare through their networks. AdventHealth started with patients who have a primary care physician with AdventHealth Medical Group and are 65 or older. Each of the eligible providers and patients in this group will receive an email from AdventHealth with information on how to register. Vaccines will be administered at three locations in Carrollwood, Clearwater and Zephyrhills, until supply runs out. Appointments are required. There is no out-of-pocket cost for receiving the vaccine. 

Baycare Medical Group (BMG) also began offering the vaccine to patients who receive their primary care through the Baycare Medical System. Due to the limited supply of vaccines, invitations to schedule vaccine appointments are being issued to patients 65 and older on a rolling basis. As capacity is available, BMG will notify patients who meet criteria on a randomized basis via email or text message. Recipients of the invitations will need to schedule an appointment to be seen at a designated location.   Again, I’m continuing to work with state and local leaders to expand opportunities for seniors to get vaccinated through pharmacies and community health centers. I am also advocating for local health departments to receive more doses of the vaccine as quickly as possible. 

The Pasco County Health Department has a new way to pre-register for #COVID19 vaccine. Register so you're ready when new appointment slots open. This is a much more efficient system with the capacity to improve vaccine distribution and alleviate significant frustration for those seeking an appointment.  Also, many people have asked about vaccine availability in East Pasco. The county has just announced a new drive-thru vaccination site at St. Leo University. The county will only be accepting registered patients with an appointment at all vaccine locations, and at this time slots are reserved for seniors over the age of 65.   

Pinellas County will also be using a new registration system for vaccine distribution and expects to receive more doses next week. Click here to learn more. 
 

Fighting for Our Heroes

The K2 Veteran featured in this heartbreaking story is absolutely right-we must hold up our end of the end of the bargain. While I remain hopeful that the draft Executive Order will still be signed, I will never stop fighting for these heroes until they receive the care and benefits they deserve.  
 

Additionally, the delays Veterans have faced in trying to obtain copies of their records are unacceptable. I’m glad to see the VA finally working on an expedited pathway that will allow Veterans to access the benefits they deserve.  
 

Providing Relief to Small Businesses

I know many local small businesses are in desperate need of relief. Last week the Small Business Administration re-opened the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to provide vital assistance to those small businesses who are struggling. Businesses who have never received a first loan may apply and small businesses who suffered significant financial loss during the pandemic may now begin applying for a second PPP loan today. Businesses apply for these largely forgivable loans directly through their lenders. Click here to learn more information about this valuable program. 
 
 

Offering Direct Relief to Americans Impacted by the Pandemic 

The Department of Economic Opportunity (DEO) has provided new federal unemployment benefits ($300.00 per week) for nearly 1 million claimants who had NOT previously exhausted their federal benefits before December 26, 2020. The Department is continuing to work through more claimants who fall into this category. 

However, the DEO is still working to process the new federal unemployment benefits for individuals who exhausted their eligible benefits under the CARES Act prior to December 26th. The Department says it is making the necessary program adjustments to its computer system and hopes to be able to provide these benefits to this group soon (no specific date has been given yet).  The Department advises that all claimants should check their CONNECT portal every 48 hours for updates.  Additionally, the Department of Economic Opportunity is continuing to process requests to backdate effective dates for the original benefits provided under the CARES Act. No anticipated completion date has been announced. 
 
 

The IRS has also issued the vast majority of second stimulus payments to eligible Americans. Many constituents have reached out with concerns that the IRS Get My Payment Tool shows their stimulus check being deposited into an account they don’t recognize. In many cases this has occurred because of a confusion with temporary accounts created by tax preparation companies. In these instances, stimulus checks are now being routed to appropriate accounts. Click here to learn more.  
 
 

Protecting Consumers

It is absolutely unacceptable that Amazon, Google, and others have forced Parler out of competition. This is the very definition of Monopoly power, and it is part of a larger problem. Social media giants and Big Tech should not have the arbitrary power to silence the voices of millions of Americans. I rarely find myself on the same side of an argument as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) but in this instance I couldn’t agree more; censorship by Big Tech is a dangerous precedent that threatens viewpoint equality on the Internet. The need to reform Section 230 has never been more clear. I call on my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee to address this important issue.
 
 

Raising Awareness

Did you know that January is National Bath Safety Month? Each year thousands of people of all ages visit the emergency room because of injuries suffered in the bathroom. Here are some important safety tips to help keep you and your loved ones safe.

 
 
 

Constituent Corner

I recently received this message from a constituent who my staff helped with an unemployment case. 

When the pandemic first hit and I had to file in April 2020, it took so long to get my unemployment. It didn't come through until your hard working crew reached out, got my information and reached out to DEO. Thank you again for those efforts as it helped me so much! I had two kids suddenly out of school and found myself laid off. It was nice that despite what the left thinks of Republicans, one was trying to help me get state benefits desperately needed for my family. Keep it up Gus! Your amazing!

This is just one example of the work we do each day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!

12/17/20 19:02,My Investigation Of Booster Seat Manufacturers and Other Updates,"Dear Neighbors, 
I hope this message finds you safe and well. As always, if you have questions or concerns, please contact my office by calling (847) 413-1959, emailing me at IL08.helpline@mail.house.gov, or sending a message through my website at https://krishnamoorthi.house.gov/contact/email. 
My Investigation Of Booster Seat Manufacturers Regarding Safety Concerns
As Chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy, I released a report alongside Subcommittee Member Katie Porter last week regarding our investigation into the safety of the top booster seats marketed in the United States. My Subcommittee reviewed documents from the nation’s largest booster seat manufacturers: Artsana (seller of Chicco brand), Baby Trend, Britax, Dorel, Evenflo, Graco, and KidsEmbrace.
We discovered that many booster seat manufacturers were misleading consumers about the safety of their booster seats, thus allowing for deadly risks to children. Many manufacturers market their booster seats as safe for children under 30 pounds, despite knowing that no child lighter than 40 pounds should be in a booster seat. I’m proud to report that my investigation caused Evenflo and Graco to stop marketing their booster seats as safe for 30-pound children, and others – such as Artsana – have indicated they may follow suit. Our report also highlighted that manufacturers have created their own side-impact testing conditions with low passing standards for booster seats.  
Our investigation requested that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) improve their regulation of booster seat companies. I put forth an amendment that would make NHTSA require a label on booster seats stating that they’re “for use of children who are over 40 lbs and four years old or older,” a label stating that they “strongly recommended children use this seat only when they reach either the height or weight limit for a child harness car seat as indicated by the manufacturer,” and a label stating that “to prevent possible child injury or death it is important to delay the transition from a 5-point harness seat to a booster seat as long as possible, until the child reaches the harness’ weight or height limits as set by the manufacturer.” My amendment was included in the Moving Forward Act, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives in July. I’m also proud to report that in response to our investigation, NHTSA has proposed a new rule to raise the minimum weight for booster seats to 40 pounds.
I joined CBS News to discuss our investigation and explain the importance of protecting children from these unsafe booster seats.

“Moneyball for Government” All-Stars Award
I’m proud to say that I’ve been named the newest “Moneyball for Government All-Star"" for my work as a lead sponsor of the bipartisan College Transparency Act (CTA). The CTA would amend the existing college reporting system by establishing a privacy-protected postsecondary data system at the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), which would collect and report on student outcomes such as enrollment, completion, and post-college success to help prospective students determine which programs of study efficiently support their career aspirations. This legislation would provide crucial data to families so that they can make informed decisions regarding education investments, and it would ensure that students are prepared to enter the workforce. I’m honored to be recognized by Moneyball for Government for my bipartisan work to improve postsecondary education.
COVID-19 Vaccine
Last Friday, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Pfizer and BioNTech’s coronavirus vaccine for emergency use. This FDA approval came after an extensive review and recommendation by the independent Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC). My main priority has always been the safety and efficacy of the vaccine. That is why I introduced the EVALUATE Act, which would direct the FDA to solicit the recommendations of the VRBPAC prior to a COVID-19 vaccine approval. I’m glad to see that my proposed legislation highlighted the need for VRBPAC in the COVID-19 vaccine approval process, and it helped cause the FDA to incorporate VRBPAC into the approval process in the way we recommended.
Now, we are in the beginning stages of the distribution process of the vaccine. The current estimate is that the United States will have 20 million people vaccinated by the end of December. According to Governor Pritzker, 43,000 doses of the vaccine were delivered to the Illinois Strategic National Stockpile on Monday. Healthcare workers will be inoculated first, and it will take months until we’re able to vaccinate most of the population. I’m grateful that we were able to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, and with patience, I know that we’ll get through the rest of this pandemic together.
COVID-19 Testing Challenges: Survey
Do you have a story about challenges you faced in getting a COVID-19 test in the Chicagoland area? I want to hear about your experiences. Testing is an important part of containing this virus, so I believe that testing needs to be widely available to the public and that healthcare workers need to be given adequate resources to accomplish that. Several of my constituents have faced barriers to COVID-19 testing and have expressed their concerns around the delayed administration of tests. Please fill out this form here to let me know your experience getting a COVID-19 test.
My Office And I Are Here To Help

Dear Neighbor,  As we work to beat the COVID-19 pandemic, the science is clear: the best way to crush this virus is for everyone to get vaccinated. That’s why I wanted to let you know where and how to get vaccinated here in Westchester and Rockland.  All New Yorkers ages 16 and over are now eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and there are vaccination sites across our district, including state-run mass vaccination sites at Rockland Community College in Suffern, which I was proud to help secure, and the Westchester County Center in White Plains. These state-run sites are now accepting walk-in visitors for vaccinations, but you can also make an appointment by clicking here or calling New York State’s vaccination hotline at 1-833-697-4829.
  
Additionally, New York State just announced a pop-up vaccination clinic at the Ossining Metro-North station, which will be open May 12 - May 16 from 3pm-8pm each day. 
 The COVID-19 vaccine is safe, effective, and free of cost. I got my vaccine to protect myself, my loved ones, and my community from a virus that has robbed us of so much. I hope you’ll do the same so that we can beat this virus once and for all.

 Thought of the day: “It’s not about perfect. It’s about effort. And when you bring that effort every single day, that is where transformation happens. That’s how change occurs.” – Jillian Michaels  


For me, Pączki Day has always been important and was one of John’s favorite traditions. The Dingell family immigrated to the United States from Poland, and Pączki Day is a Polish celebration of Fat Tuesday – the last chance to indulge before the fasting days of Lent. Celebrating this heritage on Pączki Day with friends each year is a reminder that our heritage is important. Though our celebration may look different this year, traditions such as this keep us connected and tie generations together.
Coronavirus Update

On Monday, Michigan reported 1,265 new cases of COVID-19 and 8 new deaths, bringing the state’s total cases to 575,489 and deaths to 15,158. Michigan’s COVID numbers continue to trend in a hopeful direction, with a current positivity rate is 4.5%. Governor Whitmer’s science-based actions have been effective in mitigating the spread of COVID. As our health care professionals continue working to vaccinate Michiganders, we have got to stay committed to following the CDC’s guidelines, by wearing a mask (two is better than one, according to the CDC), keeping our physical distance, and washing our hands.  
The UK COVID variant is threatening to potentially reverse the recent declines in case numbers since the state’s peak at the end of November. Yesterday, Michigan reported at least 67 confirmed cases of the more contagious variant, with two-thirds of those in Washtenaw County. As COVID variations spread, we all need to be even more vigilant and careful.
On Monday, Michigan reported 2,294,775 COVID vaccines have been distributed and, of that, 1,634,609 vaccines have been administered. With the Biden Administration expanding vaccine distribution to 41 qualified health centers throughout Michigan, Michiganders now have more options available to receive one of the life-saving vaccines. Michiganders may visit Michigan.gov/COVIDVaccine for the most up-to-date information on vaccine eligibility, safety information, and clinic locations. Residents without or with limited access to the internet, or have difficulty accessing the information online, can call the state’s COVID-19 hotline at 888-535-6136 Monday through Friday, 8 am to 5 pm.
President Biden is working to improve the distribution and volume of vaccines being delivered to states. Much work still needs to be done as many Americans continue to experience difficulties in getting a vaccine, even when eligible, and health centers are forced to cancel appointments due to shortages. 
On Thursday, President Biden will travel to Michigan to meet with workers at Pfizer as the Administration continues work to increase the supply and availability of vaccines. Last week, the Biden Administration secured a deal with Pfizer and Moderna for an additional 100 million doses of each of their vaccines. There’s no time to waste. We must do everything we can to address vaccine shortages and quickly get shots into the arms of as many as possible.
Local pharmacies like Meijer and Rite Aid have launched webpages to provide the most up-to-date information on their vaccination plans, including options for eligible Michiganders to pre-register and schedule appointments for COVID vaccines online or by phone.
Michigan continues to prioritize vaccines for those 65 and older, front-line workers, some state and federal workers, jail and prison staff, Pre-K through 12th-grade teachers, and childcare providers.
To pre-register with a Meijer Pharmacy, visit their online pre-registration form or text “COVID” to 75049 or call your local Meijer Pharmacy. Visit Meijer Pharmacy’s COVID vaccination webpage for more information.
To check your eligibility and schedule a COVID vaccine appointment with Rite Aid, visit their COVID-19 Vaccine Scheduler.  

In the midst of a global health care crisis, having comprehensive health care coverage has never been more important. With this in mind, President Biden has announced An ACA Special Enrollment Period, empowering Americans without adequate health care coverage to shop for a plan that meets their needs at HealthCare.gov.
ACCESS Community Health & Research Center is providing free, independent assistance during the Special Enrollment Period to residents needing help enrolling in the right plan for their needs.
President Biden has also taken action to extend the COVID-19 forbearance and foreclosure protections for homeowners through Jun 30, 2021. The President’s order places a moratorium on federally guaranteed mortgage foreclosures through June 30; extends the mortgage payment forbearance enrollment window for borrowers through June 30; and provides up to six months of additional mortgage payment forbearance, in three-month increments, for borrowers who entered forbearance on or before June 30, 2021.

 Legislative Update
Work continues this week in Congress to speed desperately needed aid to individuals, families, and small businesses, with House committees of jurisdiction continuing to work on President Biden’s American Rescue Plan. The President’s recovery plan includes funds to expand COVID-19 vaccinations, scale up testing, provide support to small businesses, aid schools in safely reopening, expand and improve critical Home- and Community-Based Services, extend assistance for the unemployed, deliver $1,400 survival checks to most Americans, and much more.
The urgency to pass this critical legislation has never been clearer. States are facing budget shortfalls, employment for women has hit a 33-year low, and COVID variants have begun to spread in our communities. We must act with the urgency this moment demands and get this bill signed into law by March.
Last month, along with 77 of our colleagues, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (MI-13) and I introduced a measure that would create a $1.5 billion fund for local communities to assist with paying water bills for low-income residents. This legislation, supported by nearly 100 organizations, would require all cities and counties to reconnect service and impose a shutoff moratorium to receive federal funding. These requirements will not only help residents and local governments in the short term by providing access to water and funding to assist our front-line communities; they will also provide long-term solutions that will ensure everyone permanently has access to clean, affordable water.
This week, Congresswoman Tlaib and I called for immediate action on this legislation to treat access to clean water, especially in the midst of a global health crisis, what it is – a basic human right. Every person deserves the right of access to safe, clean water no matter their financial status.

May 8, 2021 


It has been just over 100 days since President Joe Biden took office and started working hand-in-hand with us to tackle big issues, starting with the response to the pandemic. During this time, we passed the historic American Rescue Plan to ramp up vaccinations, deliver stimulus payments directly to families, and inject vital resources into our economy and communities across the country. While more work remains, these efforts have been critical to Maryland, bringing much-needed relief to folks across our state. The Congress has passed and President Biden has also signed into law measures to expand supports for our small businesses, prevent Medicare payment cuts to health care providers, and ensure our Veterans get vaccinated. Through these efforts – combined with the resilience, kindness, and determination of Marylanders and people throughout the country – we are well on the road to recovery. In addition to these actions, the Senate recently took a stand against increased violence and hate aimed at members of the Asian American and Pacific Islander community by passing the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, which will set up a coordinated response to this insidious discrimination. Additionally, I am pleased that the Senate voted to reverse Trump’s elimination of methane emissions standards that are vital to our efforts to tackle the climate emergency – this move alone will help curb climate change in just a year as we work towards bigger and broader action. We’ve also voted to confirm President Biden’s cabinet at record speed so they can get to work. 

Recently, President Biden spoke to the country before a Joint Session of Congress with confidence and conviction; seriousness and resolve; realism about the challenges we face and optimism about America’s future. As the President explained, our work has only just begun. We cannot simply revert to the pre-pandemic status-quo. We face far too many challenges to be running in place. Through President Biden’s proposed American Families Plan and American Jobs Plan, we have the chance to meet the still untapped potential of America and invest in greater opportunities for all – from our students to our workforce – while tackling challenges like improving our infrastructure and addressing the climate crisis. I was glad to hear President Biden detail these plans in his address to Congress.

In addition to these two major initiatives, there are other challenges we must take on – from protecting the right to vote, to making long-overdue reforms to ensure racial and social justice, to taking meaningful action to stop the gun violence epidemic, to enacting comprehensive immigration reform, and much more.

The best way to tackle these challenges is by working together. President Biden has already extended a hand to all Americans to bridge the divides of this nation, and we must forge ahead. I am committed to working with the President, my colleagues, and the American people to meet the urgent demands of our time.
Fighting for Reform in Law Enforcement
The jury reached a just verdict in the trial of Derek Chauvin, and we’ve just learned that a federal grand jury has indicted Chauvin and three other former Minneapolis police officers on charges that they violated George Floyd’s civil rights. But nothing will bring back George Floyd or all those who should still be alive. We must move with urgency to make changes to prevent these unjust killings. One important step would be the enactment of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to ensure greater transparency and accountability in policing. We must pass that bill, but it is not enough. We must also make structural reforms in the way we respond to many emergency situations, and I am working with colleagues in Congress to take swift action on this issue.  I was proud to join Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott to host a virtual roundtable with community leaders and advocates to discuss the need for reforming the way we respond to certain kinds of crisis situations. Too often, a police response to a non-violent situation escalates, leaving tragedy in its wake. During the discussion, I highlighted my efforts in Congress, alongside Congresswoman Karen Bass, to improve emergency response capabilities by creating alternatives when a police response is not warranted or appropriate. That’s why Congresswoman Bass and I introduced the Community-Based Response Act last session and are working to reintroduce it in the coming weeks. I was pleased to join Mayor Scott again on Friday – alongside first responders, members of law enforcement, and community partners – at the rollout of the Mayor’s new 911 diversion pilot program which will make Baltimore a national model for the very type of community-based response initiative I’m pursuing with colleagues in Congress. Mayor Scott’s new pilot program will ensure Baltimore residents are connected with the appropriate resources in emergency and non-emergency situations – and will allow our police to focus their efforts where they’re actually needed. This approach is a step forward for true public safety. 
Taking Action in the Senate To Meet Challenges at Home and From Abroad
Over the past month, I’ve been working with Senate colleagues to introduce key legislation that will bolster our economy, grow jobs, and advance our country’s interests. First, I teamed up with my colleague Senator Ben Sasse to reintroduce the bipartisan Protecting American Intellectual Property Act – legislation to impose strong economic penalties on firms and individuals involved in stealing American trade secrets, cutting-edge technologies, and intellectual property. Many foreign companies, and especially those based in China, are working overtime, often in coordination with their governments, to steal U.S. technology – damaging our economy, harming U.S. job creation, and threatening our national security in the process. This bill draws a line in the sand – outlining clear repercussions these bad actors will face if they steal vital, cutting-edge American technology.

I was also proud to join Senator Tom Carper and colleagues to introduce legislation that would reconnect and revitalize areas that were harmed by the construction of portions of the Interstate Highway System, including in Maryland. For years, Baltimore’s Highway to Nowhere has scarred the city, dividing Black neighborhoods and serving as a stark example of the long history of inequity in infrastructure. We must end this division by creating infrastructure that unites and connects communities. That’s why I worked to author a pilot program to help tackle this issue and why I’m glad to join Senator Carper in introducing this legislation to broaden our investments so our cities can transform divisive and harmful projects into ones that promote economic opportunity. From Baltimore to cities across America, this is a key infrastructure priority, and we’ll be working to get it done.

Last but not least, I was pleased to reintroduce legislation to eliminate long-term unemployment. Right now our country is facing a crisis that has stranded over 4 million Americans who have actively searched for a job for over six months without success. Millions more have given up entirely and left the workforce. In my view, every American who wants to work hard to support themselves and their family should have the opportunity to do so. This bicameral legislation, the Long-Term Unemployment Elimination Act, would create a subsidized jobs program to ensure that everyone has the chance to get into the workforce. Subsidized jobs programs are a proven way to tackle this crisis, providing opportunities to Americans looking for employment while lifting up our communities and local economies. I was glad to see President Biden include this idea broadly in his American Jobs Plan and will be working to get this vital provision through Congress.
Hearing From You
Throughout the month, I’ve been meeting virtually with Marylanders and community leaders from across our state to discuss the progress we’ve already made this year as well as the challenges ahead. On April 26th, I hosted a Telephone Town Hall to provide an update on the American Rescue Plan and answer questions from folks across Maryland. On the call, I shared the latest in our ongoing battle against COVID-19 and discussed some of the initiatives I’m pursuing in Congress to advance Maryland's priorities, including President Biden’s proposed American Jobs Plan, his American Families Plan, and legislation to tackle climate change, gun safety, school funding, criminal justice reform, and voting rights.   I also had the opportunity to join Vice President Kamala Harris, Dr. Anthony Fauci, and state and local leaders for a visit to the M&T Bank Stadium Mass Vaccination Site in Baltimore. We met with frontline workers and witnessed the tremendous efforts there to help get Marylanders vaccinated. We also discussed our work to secure vital funding through the American Rescue Plan to vaccinate Marylanders and bring economic support directly to workers and families across our state.   It was a good opportunity not only to review the progress we’ve made, but, more importantly, to chart the way ahead. That mission is only possible thanks to your input and partnership. I hope you will continue to stay engaged.

Dear Community Members of NY-14,
 
I am so excited to be back in the district after several weeks in D.C.  My first stop at home was to thank the tireless staff of Jacobi Hospital. Since the start of the pandemic, Jacobi has cared for 25,000 COVID-19 patients - and, with the Bronx facing some of the lowest vaccination rates in the City, sadly, their work is not done.  I encourage all of our constituents to get the vaccine, as I did. City-run vaccine sites are now accepting walk-ins, as are state-run mass vaccination sites. There’s also a new permanent vaccination site at the First Baptist Church of Corona located at 100-10 Astoria Blvd, East Elmhurst, NY 11369. They are accepting walk-ins, but you can also register for an appointment here.
 
Last week, we also held our monthly town hall - if you missed it you can watch it here (or in Spanish here). We discussed the Green New Deal and our FEMA funeral assistance program. To date, New Yorkers have received over $223,000 in reimbursements for burial costs due to COVID-19, through this program. If you haven’t applied for COVID-19 funeral assistance yet, there’s still time - there is no hard deadline and no income cap to qualify. Call 844-684-6333 to apply (more information in multiple languages available here).
 
In other exciting news, this week, I officially requested federal funding for 10 community projects that would serve New York’s 14th Congressional District. Over the past several months, we’ve met with community partners to determine which projects to recommend for federal funding and I’m extremely proud of the fair, inclusive and thorough process that led to these nominations. The proposed projects include the East River Barge removal, foreclosure prevention counseling, youth violence interventions, educational supports, workforce training in green jobs and home healthcare, and equipment for Plaza Del Sol Health Center and Elmhurst Hospital. I’m confident that all of these projects are incredibly worthy of federal support.
 
Please do not hesitate to contact our office if you have any questions or if we can be of any other assistance. You can reach our office by sending a message HERE or by calling 718-662-5970. We also regularly share resources and information on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook @RepAOC.

Green New Deal FAQ
 
Shortly before Earth Day, I stood with Senator Markey and a number of our allies to proudly reintroduced the Green New Deal resolution. Since the resolution’s original introduction in 2019, we’ve made so much progress - inspiring over a dozen bills and 10 regional versions of the resolution; working with then-candidate Joe Biden to advance the federal timeline for decarbonization; and encouraging support for a just transition for front line communities and workers, even among the Coal Workers Union. It’s been an exciting two years and we’ve included an FAQ with more information about the Green New Deal below. 
 
What is the Green New Deal?
Modeled off of FDR’s New Deal, the Green New Deal is a 10-year plan to put millions of Americans to work to build a new economy and reverse climate change. The legislation confronts the climate crisis,  centers  justice and equity, and looks to repair historic oppression of frontline and vulnerable communities. This is the only plan to tackle climate change that is as big as the problem and gives it the urgency it needs.
 
How will the Green New Deal affect energy prices?
The Green New Deal for Public Housing will reduce energy costs by upgrading and improving residential buildings for energy efficiency, starting with low-income households where the biggest energy savings are to be gained due to older, less efficient housing stock.  The Green New Deal for Public Housing specifically will lower energy bills by up to 70 percent annually.  
What progress has been made since the GND was reintroduced two years ago? 
	1.	10 localities adopted regional versions of the Green New Deal
	2.	We repealed the Faircloth Amendment, a federal statute that prohibits the construction of new public housing, in the House last Congress, clearing way for the Green New Deal for Public Housing
	3.	Coal Workers Union announced support for clean energy jobs
	4.	President Biden announced a plan to cut emissions in half by 2030
	5.	60% of voters support the Green New Deal, including more than a third of Republicans!
 
What legislation has the GND inspired?
Here are just a few….
	1.	The BUILD Green Act (Levin, Warren, Markey & Ocasio-Cortez) 
	2.	National Climate Emergency Act (Blumenauer, Sanders)
	3.	Emergency Water is a Human Right Act (Tlaib, Dingell)
	4.	Environmental Justice Mapping and Data Collection Act (Bush, Markey, Duckworth)
	5.	GND for Cities (Bush, Ocasio-Cortez) 
	6.	Climate Smart Ports Act (Barragán, Merkley)
	7.	Energy Resilient Communities Act (Barragán, Clarke)
	8.	Civilian Climate Corps (Ocasio-Cortez, Markey) 
	9.	End Polluter Welfare Act (Omar, Sanders, Merkley, Markey, Barragán)
	10.	Green New Deal for Public Housing (Ocasio-Cortez, Sanders)
	11.	EV Freedom Act (Levin, Ocasio-Cortez)

2/25/21 17:28,February Updates from DC and the District,"Good afternoon. I would like to provide a few updates about recent developments in Congress and share some important information.
Stop CHEATERS Act
I recently introduced the Stop Corporations and Higher Earners from Avoiding Taxes and Enforce Rules Strictly (“Stop CHEATERS Act”) to focus more tax enforcement on the ultra-rich. It is long past time we stop allowing corporations and high-income earners to avoid paying the taxes they owe. They need to pay taxes like ordinary hard-working Americans do.
Without raising taxes on anyone, the Stop CHEATERS Act would raise an estimated $1.2 trillion in revenue over ten years by investing $100 billion in IRS enforcement over the next decade. That money would expand auditing and reporting requirements to prevent tax cheating from the wealthiest corporations and individuals. This bill does not impose new requirements on small business owners, who would continue to prepare and pay their taxes as usual.
The Stop CHEATERS Act will make America’s tax system fairer by giving the IRS the resources it needs to put an end to runaway tax evasion by the ultra-rich and the wealthiest corporations in the U.S.
Chair of the Subcommittee on the Environment
I am pleased to announce that I am the new chair of the House Oversight and Reform Subcommittee on Environment for the 117th Congress. My priorities will be to fight both climate change and climate disinformation, create green jobs and protect communities left behind from the detrimental effects of climate change, and end fossil fuel subsidies.
I envision a nation that works towards 100 percent clean energy, low emissions, and communities with good quality sustainable employment. I will use my new leadership role to do everything I can to make our vision a reality.
Single Dose of COVID-19 Vaccine
I sent a letter to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky and White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeffrey Zients, urging them to consider a one-dose vaccination regimen to rapidly scale up the number of vaccinations administered in the United States. A new study out of the UK found that one dose of the vaccine reduced the risk of infection by 72 percent after three weeks. If clinical data supports an effective one-dose vaccine regimen, it could nearly double our daily vaccination numbers, simplify administration, and reduce COVID-19 deaths in the long run.
District Section
As the Administration works to expand production and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine, our goal is to ensure that every American receives it as soon as possible in order to save lives and bring an end to the pandemic. Please refer to these important links regarding vaccine distribution:
When is my turn?
California Vaccine Dashboard
Santa Clara County Vaccine Dashboard
Alameda County Vaccine Dashboard
Our District Office continues to prioritize constituent services and federal agency casework. We are hopeful that the Biden administration will be more amenable to expediting visa processing wait times and removing various administrative hurdles placed by the Trump administration. Earlier this month, our office resumed expedited requests to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for certain visa types. We are monitoring the situation closely and will continue to press for expedited processing times if delays continue to place burdens on the immigrant visa holders of our district.
Facebook Live Town Halls
Thank you to all who participated in this month’s Facebook Live town hall. In March, I will host a Facebook Live town hall on Monday, March 22nd at noon Pacific. Please be sure to follow me on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram @RepRoKhanna.

5/19/21 15:54,"It's Time, Minnesota","Hi Lindsey, 
I'm writing after another big week, both here in Washington and home in Minnesota. Congress is in session, and I have been busy with votes, committees, constituent meetings, and after-work hockey fandom (go Wild!). Like you, I'm looking forward to more meaningful progress and playoff victories in the days to come. 
Legalize. Expunge. Regulate. Tax.  
Despite broad, bipartisan support for legalization, Minnesota has some of the strictest cannabis policies in the nation. I believe that it's time for us to join other states – both Red and Blue – who have already recognized the benefits of legalizing, regulating, and taxing cannabis. 
With that in mind, last week I sent a letter to Minnesota's legislative leaders endorsing HF 600, House Majority Leader Ryan Winkler's bill to legalize adult use cannabis in Minnesota, which later passed the Minnesota House with bipartisan support. 
What do you think, Lindsey? 
 
Honoring Law Enforcement  
I also took to the House floor last Wednesday to thank Minnesota's law enforcement officers for their service and sacrifices made in the line of duty.  As a Gold Star Son, I salute the 11,000 police officers who put their lives on the line to serve and protect our communities – all too often without the appreciation and support they deserve – and I look forward to working with them to ensure all Minnesotans feel the same sense of safety, security, and trust in law enforcement. 

Watch my speech on the House Floor honoring Minnesota law enforcement


In my remarks, I paid tribute to Major Dawanna Witt, an officer who rose from adversity to a leadership position in the Hennepin County Sheriff's office. Major Witt embodies the character and values that define community policing in MN-03, and I hope you will join me in celebrating Dawanna and all law enforcement professionals who have committed their lives to protecting the most vulnerable among us and ensuring that our justice system is equitable, just, and fair to all.
Building a Foreign Policy for the Middle Class 
Last week I also had the opportunity to participate in a hearing held by the Foreign Affairs Committee with John Kerry, the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate. I asked about President Biden’s vision for a “foreign policy for the middle class” and the link between clean energy and American competitiveness in the global economy. In his response, Special Envoy Kerry highlighted the job growth and opportunities that would accompany the move away from fossil fuels.  
I believe we must ensure that our transition to a clean energy economy lifts up the middle class and inspires a new era of American competitiveness and prosperity. Special Envoy Kerry’s answers showed me that those priorities – and concerns – are shared at the highest levels of government, and I am more optimistic than ever that America’s global leadership on climate will create a brighter future for all. 

Watch my questions for Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry

In Pursuit of Peace  
Finally, I’m troubled by the escalating violence in the Middle East and heartbroken by the loss of life in both Israel and Gaza – particularly precious children. I fiercely support Israel’s right to exist and protect itself from its sworn enemies AND Palestinians’ desire for self-determination. That’s why I joined 11 other Jewish Members of Congress in signing a letter urging President Biden to pursue diplomatic engagement in the ongoing conflict, and it is my hope that both security and opportunity will become the seeds of lasting peace in the region. 
Keep the faith and keep in touch,

President Joe Biden took the oath of office this week during a health crisis and significant political strife.
I commend President Biden for his call for national unity, and his assurance to those who did not support him that he will nevertheless be president for all Americans. I urge the president to follow through on this commitment by working with members of Congress from both sides of the aisle to pursue policies that will lead to peace and prosperity for all Americans. I am praying for President Biden and his success in leading our country forward.


The Natural Treasure of Presque Isle State Park
Presque Isle State Park offers miles of beautiful coastline for over four million visitors annually. As both a natural treasure and an economic driver for northwestern Pennsylvania, it is vitally important to ensure that the beaches of Presque Isle are properly maintained. This week, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' assisted in this effort by allocating $1.5 million towards the Presque Isle State Park beach nourishment project.
I was happy to offer my support for this important project by sending a letter earlier this year to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers urging continued federal assistance to this project.


Bad Economic Policy
This week, President Biden revoked the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. The Keystone XL pipeline was approved by bipartisan majorities in both chambers of Congress in 2015. Revoking the Presidential Permit for the pipeline is bad economic policy, costs American jobs, and, as one of President Biden's first actions, runs counter to his stated goal of building bipartisan consensus early on in his administration.


Update on COVID-19
In the past few weeks, Pennsylvania and the rest of the country have experienced a concerning jump in new COVID-19 cases. While vaccines are now available, the threat of this virus is still very real.
It remains important that people continue to follow CDC recommendations: adhere to social distancing guidelines, wash your hands often, and wear a mask if you are heading out. Remember: my mask protects you and your mask protects me.
According to the Pennsylvania Department of Health, across the state as of Friday, January 22, 2021:
	•	15% of all hospital beds were available
	•	Over 70% of ventilators were available
	•	Over 15% of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds were available 
As of that date, positive cases in Pennsylvania reached 794,172, roughly a 0.7% increase from the prior day, and more than 3,533,700 tests had come back negative. This means almost 82% of Pennsylvanians tested for COVID-19 had a result that came back negative.

For more detailed information about resources available to you, visit the COVID-19 resource page on my website.

Futher Information:

The Centers for Disease Control provides updates on the virus and safety information for the public and healthcare professionals here.

The Pennsylvania Department of Health provides information on the virus and safety precautions here.

I encourage all Pennsylvanians to take this situation very seriously and observe the recommendations developed by the CDC.

My Work on Improving Illinois’ COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution
This week, I sent a letter alongside Rep. Bill Foster (IL-11) to the White House Coordinator of the COVID-19 Response, Jeffrey Zients, asking for an explanation for the unequal distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to different states. Both Congressman Foster and I serve on the Select Subcommittee On The Coronavirus Crisis and are particularly concerned with differences in the per capita quantities of vaccine doses provided to different states. The most troubling aspect of this issue is the fact that Illinois now ranks 42nd in the nation for vaccine distribution per capita. I’m hopeful that the White House will respond to our inquiry quickly and with a proper plan to adequately distribute vaccine doses to our state and across the country.
It is imperative that we continue to drive down the COVID-19 infection rate while increasing the number of vaccine doses we are administering each week. On Tuesday, I was interviewed on Chicago Tonight to discuss updates on COVID-19 and getting more relief to families in Illinois, including vaccine funding.

My Investigation into $70 Million Contract for Faulty Ventilators
Last week, I opened an investigation into the Trump Administration’s $70 million purchase of faulty ventilators for COVID-19 patients. The ventilators purchased in this deal from the company AutoMedx had been the subject of reports indicating their inability to treat COVID-19 patients, even though that was the purpose for which they were purchased. As I told the Washington Post, the federal government’s performance specifications for ventilator products sufficient to treat COVID-19 patients – which were created with input from AutoMedx’s co-founder – were almost identical to the specifications of AutoMedx’s ventilator product. The American public deserves to know whether their tax dollars were spent productively or with ulterior motives in this deal. I am determined to see this investigation through and uncover whether the federal government’s $70 million ventilator contract was waste, negligence, or fraud and abuse.
The Importance of Public Service In My Life
As we continue into the first couple months of a new year, it was nice to take a stroll down memory lane with this Roll Call article on my path toward a career in public service. I remember fondly my time working on former President Obama’s early campaigns in Illinois and how it inspired me to run for office. To all the young people out there, I hope you find a similar passion for your career, and I highly recommend dedicating yourself to public service.

Listening to Floridians
Dear Friends: 
Florida's economy continues to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. While the state's unemployment rate is below the national average at 4.7%, there is a surplus of job openings across the state. To help Floridians find employment, the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity recently announced the ""Return to Work"" initiative. The initiative works with CareerSource Florida to help individuals find employment, learn new job skills, and provide assistance for those seeking new career paths. 
Florida has led the country in safely reopening our economy and opening our schools – both of which are critical to helping Floridians get back to work and sending the message that Florida is open for business.
Standing with Israel
On Thursday, I joined Rep. Carlos Gimenez and others to introduce a resolution condemning the acts of terrorism by Hamas against the State of Israel. We must stand with our ally Israel. 
Hamas, a U.S. State Department designated Foreign Terrorist Organization, has demonstrated a blatant disregard for human life as they launch attacks on residential neighborhoods across Israel in an attempt to murder innocent civilians. Israel on the other hand, provides advance warning to occupants of buildings in Palestine that they have targeted for counterstrikes to disrupt Hamas command and control, tunnels, and weapons facilities. We will not remain silent and tolerate Hamas terrorist attacks which result in the loss of innocent lives, nor will we tolerate lies perpetuated by those who facilitate and apologize for these attacks. The Israeli government is the strongest, longest-lasting democracy in the Middle East and our closest ally in the region. America’s steadfast support for Israel is indispensable to countering the constant threats from organizations and neighboring states determined to terrorize the Israeli people. Inherent in Israel’s most basic rights are the right to defend its borders, defend its freedom from terror and defend the lives of its citizens. Israel has no greater friend than the United States.
This resolution: 
	•	Condemns the acts of terrorism committed by Hamas
	•	Supports Israel’s efforts of self-determination
	•	Reaffirms policies and initiatives combatting anti-Semitic behavior around the world
	•	Reiterates Jerusalem as the capital of Israel
Despite portrayals by some in the media, the conflict in the Middle East dates centuries before Israel’s independence in 1948. We must exercise patience and compassion as we work toward facilitating the peaceful and mutual recognition of Israeli and Palestinian people. While freedom is never more than one generation from extinction, we must defend its existence in every corner of the world.

Federal Response at the Border
Last month, Rep. Sam Graves, my colleague and Ranking Member on the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure and I, wrote to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas regarding the use of Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funds to respond to the migrant surge at our Southwest border. 
We asked Secretary Mayorkas for a thorough response outlining: 
	•	The extent of FEMA’s role at the border and involvement in the management of migrants
	•	The number of offices involved in the direction of these efforts
	•	The number of unaccompanied minors managed under FEMA resources or authorities
	•	A description of the FEMA funding that is being allocated toward these efforts
	•	The FEMA assets implemented in accomplishing these efforts
FEMA’s resources are already overextended as the department prioritizes recovery efforts addressing damage from floods, hurricanes, and wildfires in addition to disaster declarations related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Application of federal funding toward these efforts strictly corresponds with the department’s mission to “reduce the loss of life and property and protect the Nation from all hazards, including natural disasters, acts of terrorism and other man-made disasters…” FEMA does not have jurisdiction or authorization to spend funds on immigration issues, which are the responsibility of other branches of DHS as well as the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services. 
Porous borders pose a grave threat to our national security. We must secure our border using the resources and departments designated with this responsibility, while demonstrating compassion for those who seek to escape danger and poverty to enjoy America’s promise of liberty. 
Investigating the Origins of COVID-19
Identifying the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial to our ability to prevent future pandemics. Despite some taking China’s Communist Party word at face value and quickly dismissing the possibility of COVID leaking from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, recent information and international investigations have recommended a deeper investigation. A thorough, impartial investigation is needed – something the Communist Chinese Party refuses to allow. 
I recently co-sponsored H.R. 3191 to require the Biden Administration to provide Congress declassified intelligence reports regarding the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the origins of COVID-19. 
Expanded Choices for Parents
Last week, Governor DeSantis signed legislation into law that significantly expands school choice in Florida. The bill solidifies the state's commitment that students and parents, not the government, make the best choices for their education. The legislation eliminates barriers to access and allows more children from low-income, foster care, or adopted families to be given priority in receiving individual scholarship ""vouchers"" to enable school choice. Children in foster care, out-of-home care, or whose household income level does not exceed 185% of the federal poverty level receive priority access to the Family Empowerment Scholarship. The bill also expands the use of scholarship funds to cover a student's educational expenses and exempts dependents of a U.S. Armed Forces member from limitations on waitlists or scholarship program enrollment.
Every parent should be empowered to send their child to the school of their choice - public, private, online, or homeschool. During my service in the Florida Legislature, I championed laws to empower parents and students to determine the best educational path to meet their children's specific needs. I applaud Governor DeSantis and the Legislature for passing and signing this important legislation.
COVID-19 Update
Governor DeSantis has lifted all local COVID-19 restrictions and mandates. Thursday, he issued an Executive Order announcing a 60-day reprieve for Floridians arrested, charged or convicted of violating local COVID-19 restrictions. Furthermore, the Governor announced he will propose a full pardon to any individual or business. 
On Wednesday, the CDC announced that Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine has been authorized for use in children 12-17 years of age. For information on where to get the COVID-19 vaccine, please visit my website. 
This morning, the Florida Department of Health reported a state-wide positivity rate of 4.42%. To date, Florida has reported a total of 2,293,980 cases and 36,133 deaths related to COVID-19.
The Florida Department of Health (DOH) reported 15,764,313 vaccine doses have been administered in Florida. 2,012,175 have received the first dose and 7,596,222 have completed their vaccination dosage series. The number of vaccines administered to date in counties in my district as of 12:05 p.m. are: 
	•	63,059 vaccine doses have been administered in Citrus County; 53,230 have completed their vaccination.
	•	71,799 vaccine doses have been administered in Hernando County; 58,628 have completed their vaccination.
	•	174,037 vaccine doses have been administered in Lake County; 144,900 have completed their vaccination.
	•	141,354 vaccine doses have been administered in Marion County; 118,173 have completed their vaccination.
	•	84,981 vaccine doses have been administered in Sumter County; 75,062 have completed their vaccination.

A constituent contacted my office stating that he enrolled in Medicare benefits in December of 2020 and was under the impression that his benefits should have been active. However, they were not. My staff submitted an inquiry on his behalf, and it was determined that a mistake was made when applying for benefits. The constituent was advised to reapply, correcting the error and resulting in the reinstatement of his benefits. 
Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you.

Getting the COVID-19 Vaccine

As a frontline healthcare worker myself, I took the COVID-19 vaccine on Friday to protect my patients as I provide care to them over the holidays. Now over 24 hours later, my arm is minimally sore and I feel just fine. I have been a strong proponent of the methods used by Operation Warp Speed since its inception earlier this year. My 30 years of experience as a surgeon have guided my thinking throughout this process, and I know that it has been a rigorous and scientific one. It’s a great feeling to finally see this miraculous project come to fruition. I encourage everyone to take the vaccine when they get the opportunity to do so. Until then, please continue to wear a mask and practice social distancing as best as you can.
You can watch my latest COVID-19 video update here.

Discussing Eric Swalwell's status on the Intelligence Committee with Fox and Friends

 
Eric Swalwell was compromised by a Chinese agent and Nancy Pelosi knew it. Why is he still serving on the House committee that deals with our nation's most classified intelligence? Click here to watch my interview with Fox and Friends on Wednesday morning.

Introducing the SCHEME Against Congressional Access Act

China will stop at nothing to steal American
 classified intelligence and intellectual property. Now that we know the
 Chinese have successfully infiltrated the halls of Congress, we must do
 the responsible thing and act accordingly. That's why I introduced the
 SCHEME Against Congressional Access Act to help fix this breach in our
 security this week.  If
 passed, the bill would require the House and Senate Sergeant of Arms, the
 Department of National Intelligence, the State Department and the FBI
 to create an interagency background review process that more strictly
 assesses ties to the Chinese Communist Party. All congressional staff
 and paid interns would also be required to go through the background
 process. 

Opposing administrative bloat on college campuses

 
Everyone agrees that the student debt crisis is out of control, but Democrats want to double down on the policies that got us here in the first place. Administrative bloat has gotten so bad that, nationally, non-instructional spending was larger than the GDP of 134 countries in 2017! Instead of asking those who have already paid their fair share to take on more burden, we should be telling universities to cut costs and focus on teaching our kids rather than making it vacationland. Please take some time to read my latest op-ed about the crisis facing the next generation of workers by clicking here.

Defending the integrity of the Intelligence Committee

As many of you know, one of my Democratic House colleagues from California was duped by the Chinese Communist Party, and in so doing, put our country at risk. Speaker Pelosi even KNEW in 2015 that he had been compromised by a Chinese agent, but still decided to reward him with a seat on the all important House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. This committee is briefed on the most sensitive classified issues that our country faces.
If you've been targeted and tricked in the past by Chinese Communist Party spies, you should not have access to our nation's most sensitive secrets. Last week, I joined several of my Republican colleagues in formally calling on Speaker Pelosi to remove him from this committee so our intel isn't compromised by his carelessness. 

Supporting the National Defense Authorization Act

The House of Representatives passed the FY2021 National Defense Authorization Act Conference Report, which funds the military for the next year by a bipartisan vote of 335-78. I voted in favor of the legislation. The NDAA has passed Congress on a bipartisan basis for 59 consecutive years. This year's bill provides American servicemembers a 3% pay raise and authorizes extra pay for troops in combat zones.
Anytime I come across a bill that consists of thousands of pages, there are provisions that I disagree with. Although this is not a perfect piece of legislation, I voted for it because it supports our brave men and women in uniform who sacrifice so much for our country daily. From the first day I was sworn in, I have supported our military, particularly our Marines at Camp Lejeune, New River and Cherry Point. It is critical that we continue to rise above politics in support of the military as Congress has done for the past 59 years.
In addition, Sec. 519 of the NDAA was introduced earlier this year as the FLIGHT Act, which I was an original co-sponsor on in the House of Representatives. Sec. 519 requires the Secretary of Defense to create pilot programs that support Senior Reserve Officers’ Training Corps units at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and minority institutions, to include creating partnerships between military bases and institutions and providing financial assistance for pilot training.
Elizabeth City State University in our district is one of the schools that will be positively affected as a result. Sec. 519 of the FY2021 NDAA will create opportunities for African American students to pursue their dreams of becoming pilots. Elizabeth City State does a tremendous job in its mission in getting more minorities involved in aerospace science. I am very pleased the NDAA will aid them in that mission. 

Discussing the COVID-19 vaccine rollout with Maria Bartiromo

 
Joined Fox Business on Monday to discuss the latest news on COVID-19, when we can expect to achieve herd immunity, and Democrats radical ideas to cancel student debt. You can watch mt interview by clicking here.

Next year's legislative calendar

Nancy Pelosi and her Democrats recently released the House calendar for the upcoming legislative session. Since they are in the majority, they control the calendar. The vast majority of work done by Congress is in Committee. It is simply dereliction of duty that the House will be in DC for less than half of the entire year. One hundred and one days to be exact. I came to Washington to work on behalf of the American people, not twiddle my thumbs. She has done this to consolidate her power by limiting committee work where bipartisan work can be accomplished.
That is where we do the hard work of studying the issues and crafting legislation - in committee. She wants to do it all on her own and force everyone to vote up or down without having any input. That's not how legislating is supposed to work. Make no mistake, my Republican House colleagues and I will do all we can to have an impact on the legislative agenda while everyone else just sits around doing nothing. After all, close to a third of the Democrats have not shown up to work since March because she pushed 'Voting by Proxy’. Regardless, when I am not in DC I will be working hard, as I have since day one of my congressional tenure, to travel around our wonderful district, meet with as many constituents as possible, and be a force for the people of eastern NC. 

District Work
Telephone town hall on Monday, December 21, 2020

On Monday at 7pm, I will be hosting a telephone town hall about the COVID-19 vaccine, where I will be answering YOUR questions. You can participate by dialing 833-390-0715 during the event.
As a practicing surgeon
 and frontline healthcare worker, I took the COVID-19 vaccine yesterday
 to protect my patients while I provide care to them over the
 holidays. While some are questioning the safety of the vaccine, I wanted to
 provide an update, answer constituents’ questions, and reassure
 the public that this is a safe and effective vaccine. I hope many of you
 will join for the discussion!
Supporting common sense COVID protections, opposing more lockdowns

The seemingly never ending pandemic continues to take its toll on the health and livelihood of North Carolinians. We are undergoing another surge as we have done already twice this year. If this virus has shown us anything, it is that it is persistently infectious and prevalent. As a surgeon, I am not for doing something just to be doing something. Governor Cooper’s recent increased restrictions seem to be just that. They will, in my opinion, have little, if any, effect on people becoming infected or sick. They will on the other hand cause many businesses, who are holding on by a thread because of the pandemic, to be pushed over the edge into failure and bankruptcy. I cannot support baseless business closures that hurt North Carolinians’ lives more than they help. We need to continue to wear masks and socially space as best as we can and then get vaccinated as soon as it becomes available.

Marshalling the Trent Woods Christmas Parade

It brought me lots of Christmas joy to be the Grand Marshal of the Trent Woods Christmas parade. This year has been so difficult on everyone, so events like this are a great way for people to safely get out of their homes, particularly during the holiday season, and spread some Christmas cheer. So many happy smiles! It's always nice to meet new people and visit different areas throughout our wonderful district.

WEEK IN REVIEW 
Dear Friend –    As we approach the end of the year, there are a number of important initiatives Congress needs to get done – from passing the annual defense bill to providing additional COVID relief to the American people. 

Click here or on the image above to watch my remarks.
The National Defense Authorization Act of 2020 includes some really important priorities of mine, like making sure our female servicemembers have proper-fitting equipment and body armor.    I’ve also long been calling for an additional round of COVID relief for Iowans, and I’m continuing to urge my colleagues to come together and provide this critical support to folks across our state and the nation.    Iowans expect Congress to complete our work, and we need to do just that. Here’s a recap of what else I’ve been working on this week: 

Welcoming Back Iowa’s Senior Senator 
 
No matter if he’s in his office in Washington D.C., his farm in Iowa, or teleworking because of the virus, Senator Chuck Grassley never stops working for Iowans. I’m so proud to serve Iowans alongside my good friend and partner in the Senate, and it was great to welcome him back this week. 

Addressing Vulnerabilities in Our Supply Chain  
The United States has become far too dependent on other countries – including the Communist Party of China – for critical medical supplies. That’s why I’ve introduced the Mobilize AMERICA Act to help address these vulnerabilities in our medical supply chain and ensure we are prepared for future public health emergencies. 
  
Specifically, my bill would establish a grant program to allow manufacturers to expand domestic production of drugs, vaccines, personal protective equipment, and other medical supplies that are critical during a public health emergency.    In case you missed it, the Globe Gazette reported on Iowans’ support for my bill, writing, “'As a leading provider of personal protective equipment and medical solutions for medical professionals, workers, and the public – and with 3M Forest City serving as a major distribution center for many of these products – 3M supports efforts to provide robust economic incentives for the manufacturing of healthcare supplies in the United States,’ said John Geraci, 3M Forest City Distribution Center Manager in the release. ‘Accordingly, 3M strongly supports the Mobilize America Act and appreciates Senator Ernst’s development and introduction of this important and timely legislation.'""   In the Senate, I’ll continue fighting to reduce our dependency on foreign countries, like Communist China, and bring our manufacturing back home.

Fighting for Iowa Businesses  
Iowa is proudly home to incredible craft distillers, brewers, wineries, cideries, and meaderies. If Congress fails to take legislative action before the end of the year, these folks will face a significant increase in federal excise taxes on January 1, 2021.   That’s why I’m urging Senate leaders to pass the bipartisan Craft Beverage Modernization and Tax Reform Act that would make the current excise tax rate for beverage alcohol producers permanent.    
 
Click here or on the image above to read more.
COVID-19 has created significant challenges for these producers, and it’s critical that we pass this important economic lifeline for businesses across Iowa and the country.  

BONUS READ 
Operation Warp Speed has demonstrated the best of American innovation. We’ve allowed for the private and public sectors to work hand-in-hand and to utilize our nation’s full capabilities – including the brilliant American scientists and researchers who have worked so hard these past few months – to get the job done.

Dear friend,   Don’t forget, you can sign up for all my issue-specific newsletters, in addition to my weekly update, here. Also, please remember to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube for regular updates on how I am serving the people of South Carolina here in Washington. 
Pfizer Vaccine   Good news this past weekend! We now have an FDA-authorized vaccine, with the first doses set to be administered in the U.S. today. Through the President’s “Operation Warp Speed,” the federal government has secured a $1.95 billion contract for at least 100 million doses of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine, with the option of acquiring an additional 500 million doses. Large-scale clinical trials involving tens of thousands of participants showed the vaccine to be 95% effective. I see this vaccine, along with the other promising candidates currently working their way through the development and review pipelines, as an answer to the prayers of those of us who have lost loved ones and friends due to COVID-19.    If you missed my interview with FDA Commissioner Hahn a few weeks ago, you can watch that here!    Also, I have a healthcare newsletter that is coming out this week! If you are not signed up yet, you can sign up here.    Two Bills Headed to the White House!   On Friday, the Senate passed the Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Propelling Agency Relationships Towards a New Era of Results for Students ACT (or HBCU PARTNERS Act), which I authored and introduced with Senator Coons last year.  The bill is now headed to the President’s desk. Once signed, it will help strengthen relationships between federal agencies and HBCUs through annual reports on HBCU-related plans and activities, along with the codification of the President’s Board of Advisors on HBCUs. By promoting public-private partnerships and increasing transparency on initiatives and strategies regarding HBCUs, this bipartisan legislation will expand and better publicize opportunities and offerings, such as through pilot programs and grants, for HBCU students and leaders.    Friday was a busy day for legislation, as my Provide Accurate Information Directly (PAID) Act also passed the Senate that day. This bipartisan bill, which I wrote and introduced with Senator Cardin last year, will save taxpayers tens of millions of dollars through updates to the Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) statute. There are holes in the Medicare system that have harmed seniors, job creators, and the American taxpayer, and this law takes an important step towards modernizing the MSP system.      Kicking off Year in Review Video Series   This week I am putting out a special series of my Two with Tim videos; entitled 12 days of Christmas: A Year in Review.  In my first video, I chat with one of my staff members about PPP and how important this legislation was for small businesses during these uncertain times. Stay tuned this week for more!     Sincerely,

Hello,  Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them. 
  
Time in Southeast Kansas 
Celebrating CHC-SEK’s John U. Parolo Education Center Groundbreaking  On Monday, I was in Pittsburg to celebrate the groundbreaking of the John U. Parolo Education Center on the Community Health Center of Southeast Kansas’ (CHC-SEK) campus. This new, 16,000-square-foot facility will be home to learning laboratories, classrooms and conference rooms designed to support medical and dental residents, a rural medicine training program for physicians and physician assistants and post-graduate clinical training for pharmacists, social workers and psychologists, among others. The center is set to be completed in May 2022, and this facility will be another resource for SEK as the region continues to grow and train the next generation of medical professionals.  Thank you to CHC-SEK CEO Krista Postai for inviting me to attend and to County Commissioners Bruce Blair and Jeremy Johnson, City Commissioners Patrick O’Bryan, Larry Fields and Dawn McNay, as well as Mayor Chuck Munsell for joining me at the groundbreaking ceremony. 
 
 
  
Visiting Cytocheck Laboratory  Following the groundbreaking ceremony, I visited Cytocheck Laboratory in Parsons, which has now been in operation for 30 years. During the pandemic, I assisted them in acquiring the necessary authorizations to process COVID-19 tests for local health care providers. Since then, they have serviced over 225,000 COVID-19 tests, providing a critical service to southeast Kansas during the pandemic.  Thank you to Marketing Director Jason Dantic for the tour, as well as City Manager Debbie Lamb, Economic Development Director Jim Zaleski and Chamber of Commerce Director Melissa Johnston for attending. 
 Jake’s Fireworks  In Pittsburg, I also stopped by Jake's Fireworks to speak with CEO Mick Marietta and General Manager Greg McCanless. Preparations are underway for Independence Day and Jake’s is looking forward to everyone celebrating the holiday. The Marietta family has a long history in southeast Kansas as they continue to serve their community as a family business, and I thank them for their time meeting with me this week. 
  
Meeting with K-Coe Isom Leadership in Wichita 
While I was in Wichita this week, I met with leaders from K-Coe Isom’s Wichita branch, one of the nation’s leading food and agriculture consulting and accounting firms, with a forward-thinking and innovative approach to their client services. We talked about a range of issues currently impacting the agriculture and production sector, including COVID-19 induced labor shortages and supply chain issues, as well as energy policies and ongoing infrastructure proposals. I appreciated the opportunity to hear from K-Coe leadership, and thank Dave Burger for arraigning the visit. 
  
 
  
Celebrating Mother's Day 
To all the moms in our lives, I hope you had a happy Mother’s Day. I’d also like to wish a very happy Mother’s Day to my wife, Robba, and to my daughters, Kelsey and Alex. 
 
 
  
Bolstering Rural Veterans’ Access to Mental Health Care 
This week, I unveiled the Sgt. Ketchum Rural Veterans Mental Health Act of 2021 with my counterpart on the Senate VA Committee, Senator Tester. Rural veterans deserve access to high quality health care, including important mental health care and services. Access to these mental health and suicide prevention services for America’s veterans continues to be one of my top priorities as the lead Republican of the Senate VA Committee. While Congress recently enacted comprehensive reforms to bolster the VA’s mental health care programs, research initiatives and community suicide prevention services through the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act, gaps still exist.

Federal Grant Creates Improvements for Johnson County Executive Airport 
I visited the Johnson County Executive Airport to tour the facilities with Airport Director Aaron Otto. Under Aaron’s leadership, the airport has seen many changes in recent years, including updates to its primary runway, rebuilt T-hangars and a taxiway currently under construction. The taxiway construction is possible due to a $5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation Airport Improvement Program, and I was pleased to hear the positive impact federal grants had on helping them accomplish these projects. I also appreciated hearing his future plans, including for their current, 50-year-old hangar. I will continue to work with Aaron and his team to help secure federal support. Thank you to Aaron for the tour and to Commissioner Shirley Allenbrand, Budget Director Scott Neufield and Deputy Airport Director Larry Peet for joining us. 
  
 
  
Attending the Kansas Chamber’s Annual Dinner 
This week, I attended the Kansas Chamber’s annual dinner and joined President Alan Cobb in recognizing members and business leaders from across our state. The Kansas Chamber plays an important role in our state's economic future, and I'm grateful for the work they do on behalf of Kansans. Read more here. 
  
Wichita State University Appoints a New President 
On Thursday, the Kansas Board of Regents appointed Dr. Richard Muma as the 15th president of Wichita State University. President Muma is a Wichita native and brings years of experience to Wichita State University. Through Robba’s work on the Kansas Board of Regents, I have had the opportunity to get to know Dr. Muma and am confident he understands the innovative mission of WSU. He recognizes that it is more than just a school – it is part of the community, and a place to foster innovation, growth and development. I look forward to working with President Muma to continue building on WSU’s success and to bring new opportunities and talent to the university. Click here to learn more about President Muma. 
 
Touring General Dynamics 
This week, I visited General Dynamics, an aerospace and defense corporation and the fifth-largest defense contractor in the United States. General Dynamics’ communication links have been on every deep space probe and aboard every Mars rover and lander and are a long-time partner to NASA, the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy and commercial customers around the world. Due to their communications equipment, General Dynamics provided the only communication link the Apollo 11 astronauts had to NASA’s mission control and is the reason we were able to hear and see Neil Armstrong’s iconic first words and footsteps on the moon.   As the lead Republican on the Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Subcommittee with jurisdiction over NASA, it was great to see the work they do firsthand and the role they continue to play in our nation’s future in the space realm. I also enjoyed learning more about the company’s communications systems, radars and weapons systems research, and the technological innovations that will support American military operations. While this visit took place in Arizona, it was useful in my role as an appropriator for NASA and the Department of Defense, and it allowed me the opportunity to continue to promote Kansas and its research and manufacturing capabilities.  Thank you GD Mission Systems President Chris Brady, VP for Marketing Mike McDermott, Government Relations Vice President Betsy Schmid and Government Relations Directors Erica Striebel and David Gillies for speaking with me about your work and General Dynamics’ projects. 
 
 
  
Stopping by Fort Hays State University 
While I was in Hays this week, I stopped by Fort Hays State ahead of the university’s Spring Commencement ceremony. It was great to be on campus as students prepare for the end of the school year. I appreciated the opportunity to walk through the Dole Sisters Lobby, talk to Andrew Cutright in Hammond Hall and visit with others while on campus. Thanks to everyone who took time out of their day to speak with me, and congrats to the class of 2021! 
  
 
  
Thank You, Nurses 
Thursday was National Nurses Day. For all that nurses have endured, sacrificed and achieved during the COVID-19 pandemic, please join me in recognizing them. Thank you for the compassion and care you give your patients each and every day. 
  
 
  
Honoring Our Military Spouses 
On Friday, we honored the men and women who sacrifice so much so their spouses can serve. Military service is family service, and on Military Spouse Appreciation Day, we recognize their support and resilience. 
  
 
  
Honored to Serve You in Washington  It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C.

Working Across the Aisle
 
  
Lindsey,
 
I ran for Congress to get things done and make Northeastern Pennsylvanians' lives better. And I knew that in order to do that, I'd have to find common ground with others who often have many views different than my own.
 
There is certainly lots of food fighting going on in Washington, but I have not stopped working to find shared interests with members of the other party -- and the numbers show it.
 
A new report released this week ranked me in the top five percent of House Democrats for working across the aisle with Republicans in the 116th Congress. This latest report comes as I continue to build on my record of introducing more bipartisan bills than any other House Democrat since I was elected in 2013.
 
It's always been my goal to be an effective advocate for our district, and I pride myself in finding common ground with others to work for the people I'm so honored to represent.
 
I am grateful to be recognized for my work across the aisle, and will continue to find ways to collaborate with my colleagues to make people's lives better.

IMPORTANT Information for Working Families: Make Sure You Claim Your Child Tax Credit
 
  
All Northeastern Pennsylvania kids deserve a safe and secure upbringing. That's why, after more than a year of parents grappling with childcare, education and food security challenges made worse by the pandemic, I was proud to help pass an expansion of the Child Tax Credit through the American Rescue Plan. I'm optimistic that it will be a lifeline for many parents who are working hard to provide for their families. 
 
To claim this expanded credit, parents need to do so on their 2020 tax filing, and the tax filing deadline is Monday, May 17.
 
Please take a moment to complete this survey to let me know how the expanded Child Tax Credit affects you:

Ensuring We Make Things in America -- and NEPA -- Again
 
  
Many of us can remember that at this time last year, our hospitals and health centers were scrambling for personal protective equipment (PPE) as they fought COVID-19, and our nurses and doctors were crying out for help.
 
The main problem is that these critical supplies, like so many more products, are manufactured outside of the U.S. This includes high-tech, high-value goods like solar panels and semiconductors, which were invented in America!
 
It's time we restore America's status -- and Northeastern Pennsylvania's status, while we're at it -- as a major manufacturing power again. We can do it.
 
On the House Appropriations subcommittee I lead, this week I spoke with Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo directly about these issues. Restoring American manufacturing is a top goal for her as it is for me.
 
I'm ready to get to work with Secretary Raimondo to make progress on this goal, and I'm looking forward to her eventual visit to Northeastern Pennsylvania to learn more about our economy and our great potential for growth.

BROADBAND 
Take a Speed Test Here. 
The sad fact is that many places in West Virginia simply do not have access to reliable broadband and the lack of access affects West Virginians every day. Back in 2015, the FCC released a coverage map that stated 99.9% of Americans had wireless coverage. I knew then what I know now: That is just plain wrong.

From the Hill to the Mountains
JANUARY 22, 2021: MANCHIN, CAPITO, ROMNEY REINTRODUCE RESOLUTION REQUESTING STATE FUNERAL FOR LAST SURVIVING WWII MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) and Mitt Romney (R-UT) reintroduced a resolution requesting a state funeral and authorizing the use of the Capitol rotunda for the last surviving World War II Medal of Honor recipient. There are only two living Medal of Honor recipients remaining from WWII, including West Virginia native and Iwo Jima veteran, Woody Williams. This state funeral would not only recognize their individual service and sacrifice, but would act as a final salute to the Greatest Generation and those who wore the uniform from 1941 to 1945.  ""Americans like Woody Williams who answered the call to service during WWII fought to ensure our democracy prevailed. Their sacrifices allowed the rest of us to enjoy the freedoms we hold sacred and helped make the United States the best country in the world,"" Senator Manchin said. ""Bestowing this great honor on the last surviving WWII Medal of Honor recipient would be the perfect way to come together as a nation to salute the Greatest Generation. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in our efforts to honor these brave Veterans and call on President Biden to grant our request."" 
JANUARY 22, 2021: MANCHIN VOTES TO CONFIRM SECRETARY OF DEFENSE AUSTIN  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, voted to confirm Retired General Lloyd Austin as the United States Secretary of Defense.  ""Today I voted to confirm Lloyd Austin as Secretary of Defense. His confirmation is the beginning of a long journey to reestablish American leadership around the globe and rebuild trust in our federal government. After meeting with Secretary Austin and questioning him during his nomination hearing, I truly believe he is the right person to lead the Department of Defense. His more than 40 year career of serving in a subordinate nature to civilian authority provides a unique background to reinforce the example of civilian leadership of our military, and that example is desperately needed as we return to a sense of normalcy. I look forward to working with Secretary Austin as we restore America’s role in upholding democratic ideals at home and across the world."" 
JANUARY 22, 2021: MANCHIN VISITS WEST VIRGINIA NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS DEPLOYED TO WASHINGTON  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, visited with West Virginia National Guard troops deployed to Washington, DC.  ""This morning I met with West Virginia National Guard troops deployed to Washington, DC following the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6th to personally thank them for protecting our Capitol with honor and continuing to show what it truly means to be a West Virginian. I am incredibly proud of these West Virginia sons and daughters and I encourage my fellow West Virginians to thank our troops for representing the Mountain State here in Washington during these difficult times and wish them a safe return home.""  To view pictures of Senator Manchin and the National Guard troops, please click here.

I extend my most sincere congratulations to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on their inauguration. Every American should want our President to succeed because if our President does well, our nation and state do well. I will do everything in my power to work with President Biden to help heal our county and to govern in the most bipartisan way because it should be about our country, democracy, the rule of law and saving our republic. We must come together to heal this political divide. God bless America.""

JANUARY 19, 2021: MANCHIN, CAPITO ANNOUNCE $975,000 FOR AEROSPACE MECHANIC TRAINING SCHOOL AT MARSHALL UNIVERSITY  Washington, DC - U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $975,000 from the Economic Development Administration (EDA) to support the launch of the Aerospace Mechanic Technician (AMT) Training School at Marshall University. This program will assist with supplying needed jobs to the aerospace industry and will help create new job opportunities and attract private investment to Cabell County.  ""The Marshall Aerospace Mechanic Training School at Huntington Tri-State provides West Virginians with high quality training to ensure they are prepared for future opportunities across West Virginia. I am pleased the EDA is investing in this great program and as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee I will continue to fight for funding that supports educating West Virginians to fill jobs right here in the Mountain State,"" said Senator Manchin.

WV STRONG
I was always taught that if you can count your blessings, you can share your blessings. I’ve been seeing so many great WV Strong and Better Angels stories. During these unprecedented times, it’s important to focus on all the wonderful things that are still happening every day in our beautiful state. 
Nominated as today’s Better Angels are the staff and volunteers at Christian Help in Kermit, which recently celebrated its 25th anniversary. During the holiday season, this group creates an annual Christmas Distribution event to help families celebrate by supplying gifts and food. This year, their plans were altered due to the pandemic, but it did not stop them from finding a safe way to help their fellow West Virginians have a happy and healthy Christmas. They organized a drive-through event with minimal contact between the families and volunteers and it was a wonderful start to the Christmas season. Thank you all for organizing this annual event and representing your special community so well. 
Please continue sharing your stories of hope, joy, and volunteerism by emailing your nomination and a photo to WVSTRONG@manchin.senate.gov . 

(Photo credit: Mingo Messenger photos by Terry L. May. Christian Help staff and volunteers load boxes of food and other items into vehicles as they drive through this year’s Christmas Distribution. The 25th anniversary installment of the program was modified from its traditional format into a COVID-safe event in efforts to continue serving deserving Mingo County families.)   
WORKING FOR YOU
JANUARY 21, 2021: MANCHIN RECEIVES VACCINE UPDATE FROM COO OF OPERATION WARP SPEED  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) received an update from General Gus Perna, Chief Operating Officer of Operation Warp Speed on COVID-19 vaccine procurement and distribution.  ""Our state needs vaccines, plain and simple. Today I spoke with General Gus Perna, Chief Operating Officer of Operation Warp Speed, to discuss the procurement and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. Until the Biden Administration’s plan kicks in, General Perna assured me West Virginia should continue receiving no less than the doses it is currently receiving. Unfortunately, the press reports are accurate and there is no federal stockpile of vaccine doses. However, as the Biden Administration ramps up manufacturing, they expect to see an increase in the number of doses distributed to each state beginning in early February. As soon as vaccine doses come off the production line, the Biden Administration intends to ship them directly to states, in a transparent manner. They believe doses will steadily increase over the coming months ensuring more Americans and West Virginians can receive this vital vaccine. I will continue to advocate for more vaccine doses until West Virginia receives enough to vaccinate every patient that wants one."" 
JANUARY 20, 2021: MANCHIN WORKING WITH BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ON VACCINE DISTRIBUTION IN WEST VIRGINIA  Washington, DC - Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) issued the following statement about COVID-19 vaccine distribution in West Virginia.   ""I am aware of the scarcity of the COVID-19 vaccine throughout West Virginia and remain disappointed by the Trump Administration’s failure to get these vaccines to the people that need them. Congress has provided significant funding to make more vaccines available to more people, including nearly $9 billion in the most recent COVID-19 relief package. I am working with the incoming Biden Administration to get more vaccines to West Virginia, so that state and local leaders can plan for the appropriate vaccines they should have had all along. While it may take some time to right the ship, help is on the way.”

12/10/20 19:50,Update on COVID-19 and the Stay Home Order,"Dear Friend, 
I hope that you and your loved ones are staying healthy and safe during this difficult time. I would like to provide some recent updates about the COVID-19 pandemic and explain the new Regional Stay Home Order in place for our communities.    Situation Update   As of Thursday, December 10th, there have been over 1.4 million positive cases of COVID-19 in California, over 475,000 of which have been in Los Angeles County. This deadly virus has taken the lives of over 285,000 Americans and over 20,000 of our fellow Californians, and we still do not have it under control. During this holiday season, COVID-19 cases have skyrocketed across the country, far exceeding the case numbers in the spring. As hospitalizations continue to rise, the amount of space and staff in Intensive Care Units (ICU), which provide care to those with life threatening illnesses, have been pushed to the brink. There is currently under 8% availability in ICUs across the entire Southern California Region. And on Sunday, December 6th, there were only three available ICU beds in the entire San Gabriel Valley.
Stay Home Order 
We need to get control of this virus. That is why, on December 3rd, California health officials set forth new guidelines that require regions to follow a minimum three week Stay Home Order if their ICU capacity drops below 15%. As of Sunday, December 6th, this Stay Home Order has applied to the Southern California Region, including all of Los Angeles County and San Bernardino County. As a result of this order, many businesses in our region are required to be closed, including hair salons, barbershops, personal care services, museums, zoos, aquariums, movie theaters, wineries, bars, breweries, distilleries, family entertainment centers, cardrooms, live audience sports, and amusement parks.
The following sectors will have additional modifications in addition to 100% masking and physical distancing: 
	•	Restaurants can operate only for take-out or delivery.
	•	Outdoor recreational facilities are open only for the purpose of facilitating physically distanced personal health and wellness. However, overnight stays at campgrounds will not be permitted.
	•	Retail is allowed indoor operation at 20% capacity, and 35% of capacity for standalone grocery stores, with entrance metering and no eating or drinking in the stores. 
	•	Shopping centers are allowed indoor access at 20% capacity with entrance metering and no eating or drinking in the stores.
	•	Hotels and lodging are open for COVID-19 mitigation and containment measures, treatment measures, providing accommodation for essential workers, or providing housing solutions, including measures to protect homeless populations.
	•	Offices should work remotely only except for critical infrastructure sectors where remote working is not possible. 
	•	Places of worship and political expression are allowed outdoor activities only.
	•	Entertainment production, such as establishments that provide content for professional broadcast, can operate without live audiences.
Under the order, critical infrastructure where remote options are not possible, schools, non-urgent medical and dental care, and child care and pre-K are all allowed to remain open with safety precautions.
Exposure Notifications                        The California state government has rolled out CA Notify, an exposure notification application on smartphones that allows participants to receive notifications if they have been exposed to a person who has tested positive for COVID-19. This voluntary system requires participants to opt-in, does not share any personal data, and does not track anyone’s location. This program will help keep families safe and control the spread of COVID-19 through our communities. To learn more about this program and instructions on how to opt-in, please go to Canotify.ca.gov. 
Vaccine Update   Pending the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) approval of a safe and effective vaccine, California is planning to distribute and administer vaccines as quickly as possible. The state government successfully requested an initial 327,000 first doses and expects to administer 2.16 million doses by the end of December. The state government is working with localities and health care providers to implement an equitable distribution of vaccines that prioritize the most at-risk populations. The first vaccines will go to the most high-risk health care workers, and then vulnerable populations will be prioritized as more vaccines become available. 
Holiday Travel    This pandemic has upended our lives, and for many families, has not allowed us to visit or spend time with our loved ones this year. However, as people traveled for Thanksgiving, and as many Americans plan to travel for the upcoming holidays, public health experts expect to see an even greater amount of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that the safest way to celebrate the winter holidays is to celebrate at home with the people in your household. For information on the safest ways to celebrate these holidays, please visit HERE.

2/9/21 10:19,Weekly Update:  COVID Relief Legislation Should Be Bipartisan,"Weekly Update | February 6, 2021


COVID Relief Legislation Should Be Bipartisan

President Biden campaigned on bipartisanship and pledged to lead the country in a unifying way. This latest round of discussions on additional COVID-19 relief will be the president’s first major opportunity to show the American people if he was telling the truth about how he would lead and govern. I know we will have policy disagreements on how to get the country through this pandemic, but as a conservative committed to governing, I believe both parties have an obligation to our constituents to work together and find common ground.

That is why I, and a group of Republican colleagues in the House, sent a letter to President Biden this week urging him to reject efforts to pass a Democrat-only COVID-19 relief plan, and pursue a bipartisan agreement. 

Part of our letter stated, “Bipartisanship is not only essential to delivering an effective response to the pandemic, but to demonstrating our shared commitment to unifying the American people and forging the pathway forward together. With this in mind, we urge your Administration to work with leaders and Members of both parties to advance a bipartisan COVID-19 relief package comprised of consensus-driven policies.” 

Since March, Congress has enacted five bipartisan COVID-19 relief packages developed with bipartisan, bicameral cooperation. Despite strong support now on both sides of the aisle for an additional pandemic relief package that includes funds to strengthen national vaccination and testing programs, immediate assistance to individuals and families, and expanded support for struggling businesses, Democratic Leaders in Congress have signaled they intend to forgo meaningful bipartisan negotiations, resorting instead to the partisan budget reconciliation process. This tool allows spending legislation, such as COVID-19 relief, to be enacted without bipartisan support. 

You can read the full letter here.

Meeting with National Guard Leaders


Pictured above: Rodney greets members of the National Guard from Illinois

This week, I met with leaders of the National Guard providing support to the U.S. Capitol Police, including Major General William Walker, Commanding General for the District Columbia of National Guard, Brigadier General John Driscoll, Task Force Capitol Grounds Commander, and other members of the National Guard.

As last month's events remain fresh on the minds of members, staff, and the American people, we are so grateful to have members of the National Guard assisting the United States Capitol Police continue to secure the Capitol complex. We know the National Guard was ready to immediately assist as rioters approached the Capitol on January 6th, but there was a clear breakdown in the approval process. This failure is just one of the reasons I've called for immediate public hearings to address security operations and for Congress to establish a 9/11-style commission to prevent this from ever happening again. We must understand where the breakdown happened, take steps so this never happens again, and hold anyone responsible for this delay accountable.


Pictured above: Rodney discusses the National Guard security posture on Capitol Hill with Major General Walker and Brigadier General John Driscoll.



Expanding Registered Apprenticeship Programs

This week, I voted in support of the National Apprenticeship Act, which seeks to create nearly 1 million additional apprenticeship opportunities over the next five years.

Registered Apprenticeships are a successful, proven federal workforce training program that creates new, good-paying jobs. That is why I proudly voted in support of this bill. This bipartisan legislation will create nearly 1 million new apprenticeships over the coming years and will offer out-of-work Americans new job opportunities in this struggling economy. We should be doing everything we can to get our economy going again, and that starts by building on what works and enacting job-creating policies.

You can learn more about this legislation here. 


Grant Awarded to Heritage Behavior Health Center in Decatur

This week, our office announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded a $4,000,000 Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) Expansion Grant to Heritage Behavior Health Center in Decatur. The grant will enable them to become a federally designated CCBHC allowing them to expand their services to integrate primary care alongside critical behavioral health services.

I congratulate Heritage Behavior Health Center on receiving this multi-million dollar federal grant that will allow them to expand their already wide-array of services to the community. It will ensure that those who need access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment will be able to receive it alongside primary health care services. This is a great example of the kind of investments the federal government is making to improve access to care and I’m proud to support it. I've visited Heritage multiple times during my time in Congress and know that they'll put the funding to good use for Decatur and the surrounding communities.

You can learn more about this grant here. 


Remembering the Life of Rosemarie Long


I was saddened to learn of the passing of my good friend Rosemarie Long, leader of the Sangamon County Republicans, this week. Rose was a mentor to me and so many others in Sangamon County. She cared deeply about her community and will be sorely missed. I cannot believe she is gone. May God continue to bless her family at this sorrowful time.

I spoke on the House floor to remember the life of Rose. You can watch my full remarks here.

Dear Friend,

Serving the good folks of the Third District of Georgia is my number one priority, and I want you to know that I am listening. In 2021, I will be working to expand broadband in rural areas, help small businesses recover from the pandemic, create jobs in our communities, keep taxes low, increase opportunities for families and students, increase access to quality healthcare, address mental health issues, and more.
2020 was challenging for so many, but we as Americans are resilient. In 2021, I will continue to work tirelessly for you in Congress and am even more invigorated to help lead us forward down the road to recovery. By working with my colleagues in Congress, federal agencies, and localities to ensure that your voices and priorities are heard, I am committed to getting real results for the people of the Third District.  Click here to read more about my priorities this Congress.

Committee Action
Last Thursday, the Ways and Means Committee held an Oversight Subcommittee hearing on free tax preparation services for timely returns. Since many rural communities don’t have the same resources as those in urban areas, we must ensure that accurate information and assistance are available - even in less populated areas. Since everyone is entitled to a timely tax return, we must find the best targeted approach to ensure the process runs smoothly. Click here to watch my full remarks.




RIP Rush Limbaugh
On Wednesday, I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Rush Limbaugh, a conservative icon and giant of the radio industry. For decades, Rush spoke directly to millions of Americans every day and revolutionized the way folks consumed the news. Without question, his voice will sorely be missed. My thoughts and prayers are with his family, loved ones, and fans as we mourn this devastating loss.

Vaccine Registration
Last week, Governor Brian Kemp announced the rollout of a new website where Georgians can pre-register for the COVID-19 vaccine. Folks that are not currently in the priority groups can still visit the webpage and pre-register for the vaccine on a voluntary basis. If you feel the vaccine is the right choice for you and your family, you can register through the website here.

Friend,

Last week was National Police Week. I recently stopped by the Hastings Police Department to pay my respects to our local heroes in person. We simply cannot thank these men and women enough. To all members of the West Michigan law enforcement community, thank you for your service and bravery. May we all continue to remember those who lost their lives in the line of duty. Thanks for reading this week's Monday Message!

HONORING WEST MICHIGAN LAW ENFORCEMENT


Michigan has more than 17,000 brave men and women currently serving in uniform. We owe these dedicated public servants our deepest gratitude for their efforts to protect our families and keep our communities safe. Michigan has lost more than 600 law enforcement officers in the line of duty, including 15 from Grand Rapids Police Department, six from Battle Creek Police Department, and five between Montcalm, Barry, and Kent Counties. I will always advocate for policies that support the law enforcement community. We should do everything we can to help these men and women, rather than adding additional challenges to their essential work. I thank our law enforcement and remember all who gave their lives in service to our communities. Read more here. 

INCREASING FUNDING FOR THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION


Last week the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology Subcommittee on Research and Technology approved the National Science Foundation (NSF) for the Future Act, a bill I cosponsored that increases NSF research funding. My amendment was adopted unanimously to ensure that students interested in degrees related to cybersecurity are eligible applicants for scholarships and fellowships under NSF's Graduate Research Fellowship Program. Increased funding for NSF will support ongoing efforts led by Michigan’s University Research Corridor, one of the nation’s top academic research clusters made up of Michigan State University, the University of Michigan, and Wayne State University. NSF funding will ensure Michigan’s top research institutions remain global leaders in innovation. Read more here. 

COMBATING TEACHER SHORTAGES IN WEST MICHIGAN

Last week I joined Representatives Rodney Davis (R-IL), Jason Crow (D-CO), and Jahana Hayes (D-CT) in introducing the Teacher, Principal, and Leader Residency Access Act. This bill would give teachers in training more flexibility with federal work-study funds, enabling them to take advantage of a wider variety of residency and preparation opportunities. During this challenging time when schools are strained and facing serious teacher shortages, we must utilize every resource available to ensure all individuals who aspire to become teachers have access to the training and hands-on classroom experience they need to succeed. I'm proud to cosponsor this important legislation that will benefit educational institutions and students across Michigan. Read more here.

Since our last update, the 3rd District experienced 2,714 new cases of COVID-19 and sadly 33 more of our fellow constituents and community members lost their lives to the virus. Currently, the counties in our Congressional District have a total of 173,890 confirmed cases and an average COVID-19 positivity rate of 2.0%. Fortunately, we are seeing an average decrease in positivity rates over the last 7 days of -0.3%.

Colusa, Glenn, Lake, Sutter, and Yolo Counties are in to the Moderate tier, which allows for many businesses to re-open with modifications. Many can open indoor services at 50% capacity, while some can open at 25% capacity. 
Sacramento, Solano, and Yuba Counties are in the Substantial tier, which permits some non-essential indoor businesses to re-open. 
For more information regarding what specific services might be returning you can visit the California Department of Public Health’s webpage for its Blueprint for a Safer Economy. For more information on the tiers and what they mean for restrictions in your community you can visit the California Department of Public Health’s website here. 
County COVID-19 Vaccination Snapshot
All Californians 16 years and older are now eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. California has administered a total of 32,851,089 vaccine doses. Counties in the 3rd District have administered a total of 1,839,835. The State Government is responsible for distributing the vaccine and setting eligibility standards.

Dear Lindsey  , 
I have exciting news to share with you. Starting tomorrow, Saturday, May 1st thru Saturday, May 8th, I’m spearheading Michigan’s 14th Congressional District’s Mass Vaccination Week. I’ve collaborated with local vaccine clinics, organizations, churches, local governments, and the Detroit Lions, among others, to get more Michiganders vaccinated. We’re working together to GOTV—Get Out The Vaccine.  There will be walk-up vaccine clinics spread throughout the 14th District. No appointment needed. The vaccine is safe, effective, and free. It’s the ultimate tool to keep yourself, your family, and your communities safe.  We’re doing it the week leading up Mother’s Day because since you love your mother, and your mother loves you, give the gift of vaccination.   You can find more information on my website HERE. Please note the times and days of when these vaccine clinics operate. 

I also want to share the work I’ve been doing in DC and the district over the past month: 
	•	Over $9.3 million in coronavirus relief is coming back for MI-14 health centers from the American Rescue Plan
	•	I voted to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act and help close the gender and racial wage gaps
	•	I reintroduced legislation to boost financial aid to students
	•	I led a bipartisan letter urging the Biden Administration to prioritize funding from the American Rescue Plan for minority-owned small businesses
	•	I reintroduced legislation to improve maternal health outcomes for pregnant veterans
	•	I introduced a bill to strengthen and invest in our environmental health workforce

BE AWARE OF COVID-19 SCAMS 
Dear Friend,

2020 has been an unprecedented and challenging year for us all – but we have made it this far by sticking together and looking out for one another. Sadly, there are predators out there who seek to take advantage of Americans struggling with the pandemic’s devastating economic impact and may attempt to lure you into scams. That’s why I’m reaching out today to make you aware of some common scams in hopes of preventing you and your loved ones from becoming victims. Below are some examples of schemes that have been identified during the public health emergency and tips on how you can protect yourself. 

Fake COVID-19 treatments and cures 
	•	Avoid online offers for devices and medicine that claim to cure COVID-19. As of December 4, 2020, there are no approved treatments, cures or vaccines for COVID-19. However, several vaccines are currently in development and show promising results. Please note that major medical breakthroughs will be reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and trusted news outlets.
Robocalls 
	•	If you receive a robocall, hang up. Do not press any buttons or provide any personal information. Some robocall operators may claim to be from the IRS, but the IRS will never call you to demand immediate payment via debit card or wire transfer, nor will they threaten you. Typically, the IRS will first mail a bill to anyone who owes taxes.
Phishing scams 
	•	Avoid clicking links or opening attachments from recipients you don’t know. Phishing scams aim to collect personal information from you online, over the phone or in a text message. Often, these communications appear to be from a real organization or government agency.
Fake charities 
	•	Before donating, please consider researching the charity using one of the organizations listed here. The number of fake charities has increased significantly since the start of the pandemic. These fraudulent organizations will solicit donations but not use them for the purpose you were given.
I know that this year has been full of uncertainty and change nationwide. I want to assure you that one thing that is rock solid is my commitment to serving 9th District residents. If you or a family member needs help or may be a victim of a scam, my team and I are here to help. 
I hope you stay informed and continue to stay in contact with me by visiting my congressional website at https://andylevin.house.gov/. You can also connect with me on Facebook (Congressman Andy Levin) or follow me on Twitter (@RepAndyLevin).   Sincerely,

12/22/20 17:28,Details on the COVID Disaster Relief Package Approved Yesterday,"Dear Neighbor,
From education to employment, the pandemic has had a devastating effect on all aspects of society. It is the role of the federal government to respond to a national emergency, and while imperfect, a new COVID-19 disaster relief bill passed and signed into law this week addresses several of the urgent needs facing communities, businesses and families.
Providing Another Round of Direct Relief Payments
While the COVID-19 pandemic continues to diminish the ability of many families to have a reliable, steady income, this new package will provide up to $600 each to eligible adults and dependent minors through direct payments. Additional details on the distribution of direct payments will be released by the U.S. Treasury and we will be sure to share information with you as it becomes available.
Supporting Schools
Schools, teachers, districts and families have invested a great deal of time and money into adapting the learning environment in response to COVID-19. This new bill will provide $54.3 billion for public schools (K-12) as well as an additional $4.05 billion in education funding to states to help keep children learning and safe.

Helping Small Businesses 
Small businesses in Western New York are fundamental to our healthy economy. Ensuring they have the resources necessary to protect their workers and their future is a primary focus. This package includes $284 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), with expanded eligibility to include nonprofits and independent restaurants. It also includes $20 billion toward Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) grants for businesses in low-income communities, provides a tax credit to support employers offering paid sick leave, extends and improves the Employee Retention Tax Credit to keep workers on the job, and adds provisions included in the Save our Stages bill.

Delivering for our USPS
When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, postal workers and letter carriers continued to deliver, even amidst several attempts by the Postmaster to sabotage their efficiency. This legislative package converts the $10 billion loan provided to the Postal Service in the CARES Act into direct funding, it guarantees 6-day delivery, and bans the closing of smaller post offices, preserving the mail delivery services Americans rely on.

Fighting the Spread of COVID-19
A healthy economy won’t be possible without a healthy community. The COVID disaster relief package includes close to $20 billion for vaccines and therapeutics, $8.75 billion for distribution of vaccines, and $22 billion for testing and the tracing of COVID cases. 
Federal departments will be issuing additional guidance on the release of COVID disaster relief in the days to come. We will be providing regular updates as information is released. Stay updated by visiting our website, signing up for email, or by following us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact us if my office can be of any assistance. Stay safe and be well.

5/27/21 16:06,Update from Congresswoman Dean,"News from Representative Dean 








  
May 27, 2021 
Dear Friend, 
I hope this e-newsletter finds you well and happy Memorial Day. On Memorial Day, we honor and remember those who gave the last full measure of devotion and have died in service to our country in all conflicts, including both World Wars, wars in Korea, Vietnam, Persian Gulf, Iraq, and Afghanistan.  Our military men and women choose to do their jobs each day, despite the known risks.  They choose to put our safety above their own. The patriotism, selflessness, and pursuit of freedom expressed by our fallen soldiers inspires us today and every day.   We are making real progress thanks to the American Rescue Plan and will continue to push for more relief for families. The Montgomery County Office of Public Health announced that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is now available for people aged 12-15 at its County-run vaccine clinics. Anyone under the age of 18 attending a Montgomery County Office of Public Health COVID-19 vaccination clinic must be accompanied by a parent or guardian.    Where can you get vaccinated?  To find the vaccine provider closest to you, click here or register online with Montgomery County.  For general COVID-19 questions or to pre-register for the vaccine by phone, call the Montgomery County COVID-19 hotline at (833) 875-3967. Pre-registration by phone is available to seniors and people without internet access. The hotline is open six days a week, Monday through Saturday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Please note the hotline cannot provide updates or timelines on vaccine pre-registration, please refer to the instructions received in your confirmation email. General questions can be emailed to covid19@montcopa.org.  In the Community  This week, I spent a day touring some of our local infrastructure needs with a great group of local advocates and officials. I’ll keep fighting for the American Jobs Plan to address, invest, and upgrade this District’s public transportation, roads, and water and energy sources.  I also visited Marshall Lee Towers in Conshohocken to meet with staff and tour the towers — while examining the urgent funding needs. The Marshall Lee Towers holds 80 units, and is in need of some upgrades that I will be fighting for in Washington. 

 Legislative Update  Last week I introduced H.Res. 410 to recognize the 50th anniversary of the ratification of Pennsylvania’s environmental amendment and acknowledge the importance of conserving the environment for the success of our nation.  Last week the House passed a bill I authored, H.R. 1629 – the Fairness in Orphan Drug Exclusivity Act 402-23. This bill would close a loophole in the Orphan Drug Act to ensure companies have to prove continued inability to recover costs if they “update” or “tweak” a former drug that had been granted exclusionary status. To address the nation’s crippling opioid crisis, this bill ensures new treatments come to market and increases competition for more affordable prices.  I also joined the 23rd Annual Women in Military Service Wreath Laying Ceremony at the  Arlington National Cemetery Women in Military Service for America Memorial. Each year the Bipartisan Women’s Caucus partners with the Women in Military Service For America to host a ceremony to honor our nation’s service women and women veterans for their courage and achievements.  IRS Update  
Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)   Workers experiencing homelessness may qualify for Earned income Tax Credit (EITC). Federal law requires that a worker live in the U.S. for more than half of the year. This means living in a home in any of the 50 states or the District of Columbia, including those who reside at one or more homeless shelters, can meet that requirement.   Workers experiencing homelessness may still qualify for the credit even if they earned too little income during 2020 to owe tax. Filing a 2020 tax return, even if people don’t have to, could put money in their pocket. Because the EITC is a refundable credit, those who qualify and claim credit could pay less federal tax, pay no tax, or even get a tax refund. The EITC could refund up to $6,660 to workers depending upon their income, filing status and other factors.   To find out if they are eligible, people can use the EITC assistant on IRS.gov.   The IRS encourages anyone experiencing homelessness who has a smartphone or access to a computer to take advantage of the Free File system on IRS.gov.   Child Tax Credit (CTC)   The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury announced recently that the first monthly payment of the expanded Child Tax Credit (CTC) from the American Rescue Plan will be made on July 15. CTC payments will be made on the 15th of each month (unless the 15th falls on a weekend or a holiday) and will be credited via direct deposit. Eligible families will receive a payment of up to $300 per month for each child under the age of 6 and up to $250 per month for each child age 6 and above. All U.S. citizens age 17 and under, from eligible families, with valid SSNs are entitled to expanded CTC payments regardless of residence.   The Treasury is committed to maximizing the use of direct deposit to ensure fast and secure delivery; however, payments may be made through paper check or debit cards. While most taxpayers will not be required to take any action to receive their CTC payments, the IRS will continue outreach efforts with partner organizations over the coming months to make more families aware of their eligibility. There is nothing those who qualify need to do at this point other than file a 2020 tax return.   You can visit irs.gov for more clarification of any of the above topics.   The IRS will continue to make Economic Impact Payments on a weekly basis. Ongoing payments will be sent to eligible individuals for whom the IRS has information, for individuals the IRS previously did not have information to issue a payment but who recently filed a tax return, as well to people who qualify for “plus-up” payments, which are supplemental payments for people who earlier this year received payments based on their 2019 tax returns but are eligible for a new or larger payment based on their recently processed 2020 tax returns.  SBA Update  There is still time for some small businesses to apply through the U.S. Small Business Administration, in consultation with the U.S. Treasury Department, for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). PPP applications are still being accepted by Community Financial Institutions since they still have set-aside funding available--traditional banking institution funds are exhausted in PPP.   This SBA program is designed to efficiently and effectively implement the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act and to ensure increased access to the PPP for minority-, underserved-, veteran- and women-owned small business concerns. Eligible borrowers in underserved and disadvantaged communities can access this program exclusively through Community Financial Institutions (CFIs) that typically serve these concerns. The deadline to apply is May 31, 2021. Here is an organization accepting applications:  - PIDC – Accepting PPP for customers and non-customers   For more information click here.   The SBA also  launched the Community Navigator Pilot Program, a $100 million grant program enacted through the American Rescue Plan Act, which will provide counseling, networking and the assistance needed during this time of economic recovery to the nation’s smallest businesses. The program will target small businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals, as well as women and veterans. For more information click here.   Resources  Find food assistance resources near you. 
Mental health and substance use disorder help is available.   See the latest COVID-19 guidance and resources for Pennsylvanians.   Download the COVID Alert PA mobile app for exposure notifications.   Staying Healthy  Thank you for your continued efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19! Let’s continue taking proper precautions -- practicing social distancing, wearing masks, and remaining vigilant.   Montgomery County residents can get tested for COVID-19 by registering online here. For Berks County residents, please visit the Berks County Website or click here for information about testing options near you.  Stay Safe and Healthy,

5/12/21 14:37,"Reminder: Rep. Blake Moore's Weekly Newsletter: Visit to Mount Ogden Junior High, Davis County tour, meetings with local business and industry leaders, and more!","May 10, 2021



Dear Fellow Utahn,
 
We had a week full of productive meetings with local businesses and exciting constituent events. It was a great way to round out this district work period, and I am looking forward to returning to Washington to work on your behalf.

Visit to Mount Ogden Junior High School





My week started with a visit to Mount Ogden Junior High School, where I attended middle school years ago. I spoke to students in the advanced debate program, and I was blown away by their questions. My big takeaway from the visit is that our future is bright! Go Rams!  


Davis County Tour




On Tuesday, I spent the morning in Davis County meeting with local commissioners and touring facilities. The day began with a business tour of Udo, a start-up company striving to streamline communication between patients and healthcare providers. I then visited Lifetime Products, which produces and distributes durable and reliable outdoor home products nationwide, and they are headquartered in Clearfield. They are a true northern Utah success story! 
 
I spoke to the Davis Chamber of Commerce Business Alliance and met with their President and CEO, Angie Osguthorpe. The Chamber does great work advocating for local businesses operating in Davis County’s 15 cities. Especially as we seek to recover from the impacts of COVID-19, the Chamber is instrumental in helping businesses secure the resources they need to rebound stronger than ever. 


Avelo Airlines Ribbon Cutting Event




Also on Tuesday, I joined Avelo Airlines for their ribbon cutting event at the Ogden-Hinckley Airport. As we revive our tourism industry, we are grateful to have Avelo as an affordable and accessible option for travelers. I spoke with KSL News Radio’s Dave and Dujanovic about the positive impact this will have on our community. You can listen to the interview here and view photos of the event here. 


Welcoming the First Lady to Utah




On Thursday, I had the honor to greet and welcome Dr. Jill Biden to the greatest state in the Union! I thank the First Lady for visiting the Beehive State, and I hope her time here was productive.

Northern Utah Business Visits

Throughout the week, I had the privilege of meeting with several members of Utah’s business community, including representatives from Lifetime Products, Staker Parson Materials & Construction, TTM Technologies, GMRE, and the Davis Chamber of Commerce Business Alliance. While these companies and organizations offer a diverse range of products and services, their greatest concern was mainly the same: there are not enough workers to fill their job vacancies. The jobs are there, but enhanced federal unemployment benefits are paying people an additional $300 per week on top of regular unemployment benefits to stay out of the workforce. These checks will continue through August despite Utah’s surging workforce opportunities. 
 
In Utah, our children are back in school, vaccines are widely available, and our businesses have opened their doors. We need to get Utahns back into the local workforce so our businesses can fully recover from the devastating impacts of COVID-19. I am committed to advocating for the First District’s interests and will continue to vocalize my concern for excessive federal spending that is stalling Utah’s economic rebound and growing our national debt.



Virtual Meetings

I met with several organizations this week, and a highlight was my meeting with the George W. Bush Institute to discuss immigration reform. I have been vocal about my support for their recently released immigration reform framework, as I believe their approach aligns with the aspirational, pro-growth, and inclusive immigration policies our country needs. Immigrants make up approximately 9% of Utah’s population, and they are vital to our workforce. I thank the George W. Bush Institute for meeting with me, and I look forward to continuing this important conversation with my colleagues in Washington. 
 
I also met with Chad Hudson, the Acting Forest Supervisor for the Uinta-Wasatch Cache National Forest. The Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest encompasses 2.1 million acres in northern Utah and offers diverse recreational opportunities to over 13 million visitors each year. The land also protects critical watersheds that deliver culinary, irrigation, and municipal water to its surrounding communities. Chad and I had a productive conversation about the forest’s maintenance backlog, upcoming projects, grazing and timber outlooks for the year, and his legislative priorities. We also talked about how my recently introduced Forest TECH Improvement Act could integrate innovative technologies into the area’s reforestation efforts.  
 
I also met with Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, an organization that engages conservatives in solutions to our nation’s growing need for renewable and reliable energy sources. We talked about ways to increase Utah’s renewable energy production while protecting jobs within our large energy sector. 
 
Please reach out to my Ogden office at (801) 625-0107 if you need help scheduling a meeting or have issues with a federal program or agency, including the IRS, Social Security, VA, or Medicare. It is an honor to serve you.

U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell’s eNewsletter -- May 7, 2021 
 
U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) penned the following column recently encouraging every eligible Kentuckian to sign up for the COVID-19 vaccine: 
Vaccine Doses Filled With Hope And Optimism  By U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell  April 14, 2021  
We’ve witnessed a modern, medical miracle over the last twelve months. Multiple safe and highly-effective COVID-19 vaccines are helping Kentuckians put the pain and worry of the past year behind us. These doses are filled with hope and optimism, and I urge every eligible Kentuckian to get their shot as soon as possible.  During a recent two-week break in the Senate’s session, I traveled the Bluegrass to discuss these lifesaving vaccines. I visited clinics in nearly every corner of our Commonwealth, thanking hardworking Kentuckians from Pike County to the Purchase. Some facilities are small and serve their local community. Others are massive, like the University of Kentucky’s Kroger Field operation that vaccinates up to 3,000 Kentuckians in a single day.  I was proud the Senate stepped up to help more than 1.5 million Kentuckians receive their shot so far. Last year, we overcame political differences and passed five historic and totally bipartisan rescue packages. We propped up the economy, supported small businesses and workers and fueled Operation Warp Speed with $48 billion to develop vaccinations and treatments in record time.  According to the medical professionals I spoke with, our goal is herd immunity—when 75% of us are vaccinated. Unfortunately, a recent national survey showed hesitance to receive the vaccine among some segments of the population. I took the vaccine just as soon as my turn came, and I encourage you to get your shot too. At this point, Kentuckians 16 and over are eligible to sign-up. Everyone should take the opportunity as quickly as they can. It’s the best way to finish this fight and help our economy come roaring back.  Kentuckians aren’t only helping beat this virus in our own communities. We’re also at the center of the national vaccination effort.  At McKesson in Bullitt County, I saw a distribution facility the size of 20 football fields. Kentucky workers move in and out of massive storage freezers that keep the vaccines at extreme temperatures. From there, doses head to the UPS Worldport logistics hub at the Louisville airport, which has distributed over 110 million doses across the country.  In the last bipartisan rescue package I negotiated in December, the Senate dedicated $8.75 billion for these vaccine distribution efforts. So far, Kentucky has received $87 million from last year’s bills to send shots to all 120 counties.  Our progress toward herd immunity has nothing to do with Washington Democrats’ nearly $2 trillion spending spree passed only weeks ago. Not a single Republican supported their liberal wish list that only spent 1% on vaccines and less than 9% on the entire healthcare fight. They denied the reality of where we are now in fighting this pandemic. Instead, their bill irresponsibly borrowed from future generations and failed to meet the current moment.  During my visits, I also had the opportunity to discuss additional concerns at the top of Kentuckians’ minds. I met with leaders from over a dozen counties still recovering from recent severe ice storms and devastating flooding. Along with my Kentucky Congressional colleagues, I wrote letters to President Biden urging him to quickly approve the Governor’s requests for federal emergency assistance to help our communities get back on their feet.  After stopping by St. Elizabeth Healthcare’s vaccine center in Northern Kentucky, I also got an update on Life Learning Center’s inspirational work to address homelessness and the substance abuse epidemic. While the pandemic has put their services into higher demand, dedicated treatment professionals and career counselors are helping those in need get a second chance. While in Owensboro, I spoke with local officials about their ongoing efforts to keep their streets safe from illicit drugs. Leaders across the Bluegrass are tackling this scourge head-on, and I am proud to continue supporting their work.  As the Senate begins another work period, I’ll take what I heard in Kentucky back with me. Washington Democrats are proposing one bad idea after another to force the whims of New York and California on Middle America. Along with my Republican colleagues, I’m ready to keep defending Kentucky’s values and delivering for our communities.

View Email in Browser 
 

Dear Friend,
The most important part of my job in Congress is hearing from Arkansans about the issues that matter to them.
On Tuesday night, I hosted a conference call to take your questions and discuss your concerns about the issues facing you and your family.
If you were unable to tune in, watch the full event by clicking HERE or on the image below.  

 Here are some of the questions from last night: 
Where can I get the COVID-19 vaccine, and what about the new strains? 
As of January 18th, Arkansas is in Phase 1-B of COVID-19 vaccine distribution.  This includes seniors ages 70 and older, those who work in education, and those in Phase 1-A who have not received their vaccinations.  Click HERE for the full COVID-19 Vaccination Plan from the Arkansas Department of Health. 
I hope that all Arkansans will get the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to you.  
In the meantime, please protect yourself and your family by practice social distancing, wearing a mask, and washing your hands frequently. 
Will there be another COVID-19 relief package?
The president is calling for another $1.9 billion, but I believe we should not rush into another bill before the $900 billion relief bill passed in December has been rolled out and had the chance to help Americans.  That includes additional vaccines to get more Americans vaccinated.  It also includes an extension of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which I fully support for how it was able to help Arkansas businesses last year.
Any further relief should be targeted by industry and to those who need it the most. 
Should the United States rejoin the World Health Organization (WHO)? 
The United States withdrew from the WHO last year because it appeared that the WHO helped China cover up its role in the spread of COVID-19 and to call attention to the lack of accountability and independence at the WHO and its initial response to the pandemic. It was not meant to undermine the good work that the organization does for public health.
I am calling on President Biden to call attention to China’s manipulation of the WHO and hold the Chinese Communist Party and those at the WHO accountable for the delayed response to the pandemic.  Should President Biden increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour?
I do not support increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour because labor markets are a local concern and should not be federally mandated.  Additionally, increased minimum wages have been shown to lead to higher prices, job losses and reduced hours, lower overall wages.  Finally, Arkansas voters spoke and Arkansas is phasing in a new minimum wage – decision that was made at the local level with input from local businesses and citizens.
Are our elections secure? 
Americans deserve to have full confidence in the integrity and security of our elections. Due to the pandemic, our election system was under unprecedented strain. I share Arkansans’ concerns about the hasty adoption of mail-in ballot systems and lack of adherence to voter ID laws.  
I support creating a bipartisan commission to review the November election results, assess procedures, identify irregularities, and make recommendations to the states for reform. I disagree with those who would give the federal government more control over our election system. The Framers specifically gave that power to the states in our Constitution, and I pledged an oath to the Constitution.

It is an honor to serve as your voice in Congress. If you have any additional questions or need assistance with a matter before the federal government, please contact my office at Hill.House.Gov or call my Little Rock office at (501) 324-5941.

Sincerely,

Dear Friends, 
Last week, President Biden made his first joint address to Congress and to the nation. Because of President Biden and our Democratic Congress, America is on the move again. Building upon the landmark and transformational American Rescue Plan, President Biden laid out his American Jobs and American Families Plans before the American people. Now, Congress is hard at work to enact these plans into law—and continues to invest in people to recover from the pandemic. 
In just 100 days, we have delivered on promises and laid the foundation for transformational change. After helping to put over 220 million vaccines in arms and money in pockets, President Biden has crafted a vision for our country to overcome the pandemic, create opportunity, and construct an architecture for a prosperous and equitable future.
From fixing our crumbling roads and bridges, revitalizing transit systems, ensuring access to clean drinking water, and bringing high-speed broadband to every corner of our country, the American Jobs Plan will move our country’s economy into the 21st century and create good, union jobs that cannot be outsourced. The COVID-19 pandemic has proven that we cannot simply return to normal. We must meet the moment by building the architecture for our nation’s future. 
President Biden’s American Families Plan recognizes that our country is hurting, and bold federal action is needed to get the United States back on its feet. Combined with the American Rescue Plan and the American Jobs Plan, this proposal has the potential to transform tens of millions of lives. It includes a five-year extension of the expanded and improved Child Tax Credit—a provision I have championed for nearly two decades—in an important first step in the fight to quickly make this expansion permanent, extend a lifeline to poor, working and middle class families, and cut child poverty. 
The American Families Plan will make critical investments in child care, pre-school, and higher education. We have long known that safe, high-quality child care and pre-school changes a child’s trajectory and bolsters working parents, but it remains out of reach for too many families. This investment will help reopen our economy, support children and families, and improve racial equity. 
Additionally, it will allow kids and families to access nutritious foods by expanding the Summer EBT program to all 29 million eligible children and by expanding the successful school meals program, which is now the healthiest source of food consumed in the country. 
The Plan includes national paid family and medical leave provisions. For nearly a decade I have introduced the FAMILY Act, which would create a comprehensive national program that helps meet the needs of new mothers and fathers and people with serious personal or family health issues. And, yet, despite the years that have passed, the United States is the only industrialized nation with no paid family leave. It is encouraging to have willing partners that will work towards making paid family and medical leave provisions a reality for American workers. The President also urged Congress to pass the Healthy Families Act, my legislation to establish a national paid sick days policy. 
The Biden administration is laying the groundwork to reshape the economy by directly investing in our people, our schools, and our communities. To pay for these sweeping investments, President Biden is rightly reversing tax giveaways and requiring millionaires and billionaires to play by the same rules as everyone. 
Congress has the opportunity to move these plans forward, and the ability to make them even stronger. Now is the moment to make the expanded and improved Child Tax Credit permanent to lift generations of children out of poverty and help working and middle-class families who are more hard-pressed than ever. It was 86 years ago that President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act so that our oldest citizens in retirement would have the promise of security and a bulwark against poverty. We owe our youngest the same promise and protection. Just as President Roosevelt faced a moment ripe for bold action and big change, so do we.
As we continue to write legislation in Congress to carry out President Biden’s bold vision, please know that I will keep you informed on how you and your families can access the critical lifelines included in the plans. Together, we can lift up the American people so that every person, no matter their background, has the opportunity to contribute and succeed.
In the meantime, please do not hesitate to reach out to my office if you have any questions or concerns about this news or any other matter. 


Stay safe and be well, 


Rosa DeLauro

December 10, 2020 
@MyKitchenTable: Thursday, December 10, 2020
Dear Friend: 
Billy Sunday once said, “Stopping at third adds no more to the score than striking out. It doesn't matter how well you start if you fail to finish.   We need to finish this year strong, getting another COVID deal done and a plan to fund the government.   Today was an important day in the fight to end the COVID-19 pandemic. An advisory FDA panel voted to recommend granting Emergency Use Authorization for Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine. The panel reviewed the safety data and examined the evidence that Pfizer presented and deemed it was safe and effective enough to be cleared for emergency use.   The 21st Century Cures Act – Rep. Diana DeGette’s (D-CO) and my historic, bipartisan legislation that became law almost four years ago to the day – accelerated the development and discovery of medical cures and devices, helping to bring treatments, cures, and vaccines to market faster and more efficiently. Because of 21st Century Cures, we have a COVID-19 vaccine faster than ever thought to be possible. The U.S. will soon begin shipping millions of doses of the Pfizer vaccine, possibly as soon as tonight.  And remember, the vaccine will be shipped from Pfizer’s location here in southwest Michigan. Boxes with 1,000 doses each will be packed up with 50 pounds of dry ice and delivered across the nation. CBS reported 25M doses being sent before the end of the year. Southwest Michigan is literally helping to save the world, and we take tremendous pride in all of those Michiganders who have been and will continue to serve such a critical role in distributing this life-saving vaccine around the country and throughout the world. You can read more about Pfizer’s vaccine and the role SW MI is playing to distribute it HERE.  Michigan’s state health department reported today that within two weeks of the vaccine being shipped to Michigan, all hospitals and health departments will get a shipment.   In the meantime, the coronavirus continues to surge across the country. More than 289K Americans have died, and we set a single day record on Wednesday of more than 3,000 deaths. It’s tragic, and we need to be mindful to wear our masks, wash our hands, and keep our distance not only for ourselves, but for the doctors, nurses, and hospital workers who are under tremendous stress and working under burdensome conditions.  The FDA did issue authorization on the first direct-to-consumer COVID-19 test. LabCorp’s Pixel COVID-19 Test Home Collection Kit allows individuals to self-collect a nasal swab sample at home and then send that sample to get tested at LabCorp. You can purchase the test online or in a store without a prescription. You can read more HERE.  On Capitol Hill, our efforts to pass a bipartisan COVID-19 relief deal continue. I’m hopeful we can get something done but there are still a number of differences left to sort out. You’ll remember last week our bipartisan House Problem Solver's Caucus (PSC) released a plan that had the support of both House members and Senators, and this week we released an outline with more detail that you can see HERE. I participated in a Zoom call with the broader bipartisan, bicameral group as we discussed next steps. One of the major developments is that the White House signaled support for a deal that would provide $600 stimulus checks for all Americans in exchange for removing the unemployment benefits from the package, which you can read HERE.  The rubber hits the road next week. We hope to get a final COVID-19 relief deal done along with a longer-term package to fund the government (we passed a one-week extension of government funding yesterday). We should NOT be adjourning for the holidays without getting a deal done. Aid for small businesses (PPP), broadband, health care providers, educators, state/local funding (no money to bail out pension funds or past deficits...only itemized losses of tax revenue—sales and gas taxes—would qualify), and liability protections remain central components of the bipartisan package we are discussing.   One of the sticking points is over the liability protections, which will protect small businesses from coronavirus-related lawsuits, which you can read in Roll Call HERE. I would note that without liability protections, insurance will not provide for attorneys to defend cases for small businesses. This needs to be part of the package or it would become a massive burden on small businesses that are already struggling to stay afloat. Education groups have joined those in the business community in support of this provision.  I’d also mention that the Detroit Chamber of Commerce sent a letter late Tuesday night urging the Congressional delegation to adopt another COVID-19 relief package. The chamber’s President and my friend, Sandy Baruah, wrote: “The situation is urgent and can’t wait until the new Congress and administration are seated in 2021” as businesses in Michigan and across the country suffer while COVID cases spike. You can read that story HERE.  I’ve heard from many families and small businesses across my district that they are going to need help – Congress has to deliver. Let’s get it done. 

Lastly, our photo of the day is from the Berrien County Sheriff’s Department, where their K9’s Blek, Maxx, and Mika received donations of bullet and stab protective vests from the non-profit, Vested Interest in K9s, Inc. We’re grateful for their service!  All the best, 
   Fred Upton

1/24/21 15:25,Dave's Weekly Wrap,"Friends,

As someone who considers it an honor and a privilege to witness the peaceful transition of power - a pillar of our democracy - I attended the inauguration ceremony on Wednesday. I have now proudly attended five presidential inaugurations, regardless of whether or not I voted for who was elected. 


While I did not vote for President Biden and Vice President Harris, I wish them the best because the fact of the matter is that their success is the American people’s success. We will not always agree on how to achieve that success, but I will always be willing to reach across the aisle with the respect and civility necessary for us to work together so that we can effectively tackle the challenges facing our country.

Thanking the Ohio Soldiers Who Helped Secure Our Nation's Capital


On Thursday, I got the chance to spend some time with several Ohio National Guard soldiers who helped support civilian law enforcement secure the U.S. Capitol and surrounding areas leading up to and during the inauguration. 

These brave men and women left their jobs and families during our time of need, and while it is deeply troubling that the support of our National Guardsmen and women was necessary to preserve and uphold the rule of law in our nation’s capital, I am thankful that their efforts helped ensure a peaceful transition of power. 

They have selflessly stepped up in so many ways this year, by facilitating vaccine distribution to our seniors and helping Ohioans in need at local food banks. I couldn't be prouder of their unwavering professionalism and dedication to their community and their country.


Of course, we had to get in a loud and proud OH-IO! before they headed back home to the Buckeye State (click here or on the photo above to hear it). 

Securing Critical Projects for Northeast Ohio in New Army Corps Work Plan

I'm pleased to report that several projects critical to Northeast Ohio and the Great Lakes have been incorporated in the fiscal year 2021 (FY21) U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Work Plan, including the preconstruction of the Asian carp barrier at Brandon Road Lock and Dam, and the removal of dredged material in the Conneaut, Ashtabula, Fairport and Cleveland Harbors. 

Any threat to the Great Lakes is a threat to our regional economy, the jobs of thousands of hardworking Buckeyes, the drinking water supply for millions, and the ecosystem of more than 3,500 plants and animals. That’s why I have tirelessly advocated for these projects and fought to provide them with the funding they need as a member of the House Appropriations Committee.

Specifically, the FY21 USACE Work Plan includes $3.8 million for the Brandon Road Lock and Dam Project, which is a key choke point intended to block Asian carp’s access to the Great Lakes ecosystem. Combined with state level funding, the resources provided by the Work Plan will allow for the continuation of preconstruction, engineering and design work. It also includes funding to support Operations and Maintenance activities such as dredging in Northeast Ohio harbors including:
	•	$23.941 million for Cleveland Harbor
	•	$911,000 for the Conneaut Harbor
	•	$1.42 million for Fairport Harbor
	•	$2.29 million for Ashtabula Harbor

By providing the funding needed to further the Brandon Road Lock and Dam Project and remove dredged material in our harbors, we will help mitigate the threat invasive Asian carp pose to Lake Erie and help ensure our harbors can continue operating at full capacity and making significant contributions to our regional economy. I applaud the Army Corps of Engineers for prioritizing these projects in their latest Work Plan and look forward to seeing the benefits they’ll provide to our communities.

Reaffirming My Dedication to Bipartisanship, Commonsense Lawmaking

On Friday, the Problem Solvers Caucus announced its members for the 117th Congress. I am proud to say that I remain an active member of this bipartisan group. 

For those who haven't heard of it before, the Problem Solvers Caucus is an independent group in Congress comprised of representatives from across the country – equally divided between Democrats and Republicans – committed to finding common ground on many of the key issues facing the nation.  

Those of us in the caucus are united in the idea that there are commonsense solutions to many of our country's toughest challenges, but they can be found only when we work together as Americans to successfully break through the gridlock of today’s politics. 


Now more than ever, Americans deserve a good-faith effort from their elected officials to drop the toxic blue team versus red team mentality and work together to solve the challenges facing our nation.

As I've said before, fairly evaluating ideas outside of our own ideology doesn’t require us to stray from our principles or force us to adopt views we’re fundamentally opposed to. All it takes is for us to give each other the chance to be seen not as a member of a political party, but as men and women with values, families and loved ones, and experiences that have shaped who we are and what we stand for. By doing so, we not only encourage effective lawmaking, we also ensure that when we do disagree, we can do so respectfully. 

I am proud to be a member of the Problem Solvers Caucus and look forward to working across the aisle to prioritize the needs of OH-14.

God bless and stay well,

Dave

1/15/21 15:56,This week’s impeachment vote and COVID-19 updates,"Dear Neighbors,
I voted to impeach President Trump this week because he made it clear on January 6, 2021 that he is unfit to serve as President of the United States. The President called on domestic terrorists to come to Washington and encouraged them to attack the Capitol. As a result, five people are dead, including a Capitol Police officer from New Jersey. President Trump’s willful incitement of insurrection poses a clear and imminent threat to our country’s democracy. We will not tolerate anyone who seeks to use elected office to willfully support the overthrow of a government for the people and by the people. Read more here
I went to the Visiting Nurse Association of Central Jersey’s (VNACJ) Community Health Center in Asbury Park this week to provide an update on the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic. Community health centers like the one in Asbury Park are on the front line of the coronavirus pandemic and are working around the clock to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are effectively and efficiently distributed to our health care workers and vulnerable members of our community. Read more here
I also toured the new mega vaccination site at the New Jersey Convention and Exposition Center with Governor Phil Murphy in Edison. The site is one of six mega-sites in New Jersey designed to help accelerate COVID-19 vaccinations around the state. I’ll work with the incoming Biden Administration to ensure that New Jersey has the funding and support it needs to continue expanding vaccination efforts. Read more here

The Non Covid Relief Covid Bill
It’s not “Covid relief” if more than $1 trillion of it isn’t for Covid relief.

In reality, more than half of the money in this bill will be spent to bail out blue states, expand progressive programs, and fund pet projects for Democrat Members of Congress.

The Biden Administration Has Created the New Border Crisis

The Democrats' Endless Hypocrisy
The Left's hypocrisy is truly endless.

So, Trump put children in ""cages"" while Biden's putting them in ""shelters for migrant children""? They're the same facilities...

The ""Equality"" Act Will Not Lead to Equality

What to Cut?
Biden's wondering what he can cut from the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 ""relief"" bill?

Why is this even an argument? If a 9/11 style commission is created to look into the events of Jan. 6, why would it NOT be equally bipartisan?

Findings need to be made based on facts and evidence, not political bias and pressure from Speaker Pelosi.

Biden’s DHS Is Making a Grave Mistake
It’s shocking that Biden’s DHS would rather frantically “prepare for another border crisis” than actually work to STOP the border crisis.

Strong border security = a safer and more humane immigration system.

Another Democrat Double Standard 
Democrats continue to ignore Rep. Eric Swalwell's relationship with a known Chinese spy and happily let him keep his seat on the House Intelligence Committee. A ridiculous double standard.

Babin Hosts SBA COVID-19 Relief Virtual Townhall

Remembering William B. Travis' ""Victory or Death"" Letter
Wednesday marked the 185th anniversary of the “Victory or Death” letter that William Barret Travis composed at the beginning of the 13-day siege during, what would soon be known as, the Battle of the Alamo.

As a former board member of the Texas Historical Commission, and lifelong student of history, I believe that William B. Travis, Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie, and the many other Alamo defenders remain some of the finest Texans and Americans to have ever walked this planet.

Supporting Our Law Enforcement
 It was great to visit with two of Newton County’s finest – Constables James Mitchell and Sonny White – while doing their duty as security at the basketball playoff game in Woodville earlier this week!

Fighting for Texans
Earlier this week, my colleagues and I asked President Biden to immediately approve all 254 counties in Texas for FEMA Individual Assistance.

Current storm damage estimates are more than $62 million – and that number is only increasing. Texans need relief now, and I will continue working to ensure they receive it.

ABOUT SCOTT  |   SERVING YOU  |   NEWSROOM  |   ISSUES & LEGISLATION  |   10TH DISTRICT  |   CONTACT 

December 16, 2020
 
Friends, 
 
I’m tremendously honored to serve and represent the constituents of Pennsylvania’s 10th Congressional District. As our communities continue to face the challenges of COVID-19, please remember that my offices are open and ready to assist. 
 
Our Cumberland, Dauphin and York County offices may accept in-person meetings by appointment only, and also stand ready to help via phone, email, and in some cases, video conferencing. If you have questions or concerns on any issue or need help with a federal agency, please contact our offices anytime.
 

 
This Week in Washington
 
This week, Congress is expected to address two critical end-of-year items:  government funding set to expire on Friday, December 18; and delivering COVID-19 assistance to small businesses and restaurants. 
 
American families and small businesses continue to suffer under the weight of this pandemic and government-ordered shutdowns. Since March, roughly 1 in 5 small businesses and  110,000 restaurants have closed permanently, with an additional 10,000 more expected to close in the next three months. Our small businesses, restaurants, and employees cannot afford to wait for relief any longer. 
 
Sadly, helping the American People has been low on Speaker Pelosi’s political agenda. For over four months, the Speaker has held up $138 billion in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) funding for small businesses, despite a bipartisan group of over 190 Members of Congress calling on her to reopen the program. Republicans in Washington support and fight for American small businesses and families every day, and we’ve tried over 40 times to reopen this critical lifeline. I’ll continue to fight this week to deliver targeted relief for American families and businesses impacted by the pandemic. 
 
Congress could also consider legislation to fund the federal government, with current funding set to expire on Friday, December 18 at midnight. To be frank, the delay by Congressional Leadership in negotiating and passing the federal budget is reprehensible; constitutionally it should be done by September 30th of each year. These “must pass” funding packages are drafted behind closed doors by a few people – most of them unelected – and then provided to rank-and-file Members only a few hours before we’re expected to vote (no amendments or debate allowed, mind you). This is not “legislating,” and shows just how far Congress has strayed from “regular order” and fiscal responsibility. 
 
As a result of the Congress’ negligence, I’ve again supported a “No Budget, No Pay” provision that would withhold Members’ pay if Congress fails to a pass a budget and fund the federal government. Hardworking Americans know that if they don’t show up and do the work they were hired to do, they won’t get paid. Congress should be held to the same standard – always.   
 

 
COVID Vaccine Update 
 
On Monday, America’s first COVID-19 vaccines were administered to frontline health care workers. The development and delivery of a vaccine in less than one year is a truly historic achievement and will help us defeat COVID-19. The Phizer/BioNtech vaccine received Food and Drug Administration (FDA) emergency use authorization late last Friday, and America is set to receive at least 100 million doses.
 

 
In more good news, the independent FDA advisory panel is set to meet tomorrow to vote to approve a second vaccine, produced by Moderna, with the Agency expected to authorize its emergency use on Friday. Between the Pfizer and Moderna shots, U.S. officials announced that there will be enough doses available for 20 million Americans in December. 
 
This tremendous accomplishment wouldn’t have been possible without Operation Warp Speed and the public-private partnerships forged by President Trump. Operation Warp Speed helped to deliver a COVID vaccine five times faster than the fastest vaccine development in history, and now we’re on the brink of beating COVID-19. 
 

 
ICYMI – I joined Face the State on CBS 21 
 
On Sunday, I joined CBS 21’s “Face the State” to discuss how I’m supporting our small businesses and restaurants during the pandemic and fighting to ensure the integrity of our elections. If you missed the interview, you can click here or on the video below. 
 

 

As always, if you have questions or concerns on any issue or need help with a federal agency, please contact our offices anytime. Please note that the e-mail address associated with this message is unattended. If you would like to email me, please visit: https://perry.house.gov/.

WEEKLY COVID-19 NEWSLETTER
DATA COMPILED ON April 7, 2021 
County COVID-19 Cases Snapshot
Since our last update on March 25, the 3rd District experienced 5,399 new cases of COVID-19, and sadly 157 more of our fellow constituents and community members lost their lives to the virus. With 166,130 confirmed cases, the counties in our district have an average COVID-19 positivity rate of 2.8%. Additionally, we are now seeing an average increase in positivity rates over the last 7 days of 0.1%. 

Yolo and Colusa County are in to the Moderate tier, which allows for many businesses to re-open with modifications. Many can open indoor services at 50% capacity, while some can open at 25% capacity.
Glenn, Lake, Sacramento, Solano, Sutter, and Yuba Counties are in the Substantial tier, which permits some non-essential indoor businesses to re-open. 
For more information regarding what specific services might be returning you can visit the California Department of Public Health’s webpage for its Blueprint for a Safer Economy. For more information on the tiers and what they mean for restrictions in your community you can visit the California Department of Public Health’s website here. 
County COVID-19 Vaccination Snapshot
California has administered a total of 20,641,692 vaccine doses. Counties in the 3rd District have administered a total of 1,180,117 vaccine doses. All Californians 50 years and older are now eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccination and on April 15, Californians 16 years and older will be made eligible as well. The State Government is responsible for distributing the vaccine and setting eligibility standards. 

I have compiled a list of resources below, which you can use to learn more about the status of the pandemic in your county and understand how the vaccine is being distributed in your community.

Talking Infrastructure with Maria Bartiromo
The Left has ZERO interest in the GOP's input on infrastructure or any other issue.

They're willing to bend or change whatever rules stand in the way of their radical agenda.

Meanwhile, you and I are forced to foot the multi-trillion-dollar bill.

CBP Apprehended More Than 178,000 Illegal Aliens in April
CBP apprehended more than 178,000 illegal aliens last month – a 944% increase when compared to April 2020.

The Biden Border Crisis is raging on because this administration refuses to act. They'd rather give away millions of your tax dollars than work to secure our border.

This Is Not How You ""Build Back Better""
 There were 8.1 million job openings at the end of March – a record number.

Yet, only 266,000 Americans got a job.

This is not how you ""build back better,"" Joe Biden.

 The Biden Administration Is Exploiting Innocent Children
The Biden Administration is using children, even babies, for their own political gain. The Democrats are not unaware of the border crisis, they KNOW the truth and are exploiting innocent children anyway. Is that why Biden, Harris, and Pelosi refuse to visit the border?

Democrats who do visit or live on the border know the truth. It is plain as day. It is as plain as five little girls, one too young to walk, starving and abandoned to die. It is heartbreaking to see these children being exploited and sickening to see the Democrats continuing to ignore them.

We Are a Nation of Law and Order
Keeping you and your family safe should be the top priority of every elected official.

Last year, we watched as cities across America were ravaged by violence and crime because their leaders abandoned law enforcement and bent the knee to the radical Left. We are a nation of law and order, and we should be giving police departments more support, not less.

City officials who willingly ignore the rule of law, defund the police, and let chaos reign supreme, should not receive federal funds – plain and simple.

H.R. 1/S. 1 Is the Most Dangerous Bill in Congress
H.R. 1/S. 1 is the most dangerous bill in Congress.

This bill will not only force Americans to pay for political campaigns and throw out voter I.D. laws, it will centralize power into the hands of DC Democrats looking to ensure the game is always rigged in their favor.

Biden Jeopardizes America's Energy Independence
Under Trump, we achieved energy independence for the first time in 50 years.

If Biden implements his Green New Deal agenda, we will be right back at the mercy of our Middle Eastern adversaries – a vulnerable and costly position that threatens our national security.

We Deserve to Know the Truth
We deserve to know the truth behind the origins of COVID-19.

If Communist China is responsible for leaking this virus – that's killed more than 3 million people worldwide – they should be held accountable.

Biden should declassify the intelligence related to this leak NOW!

Climate Change Should NEVER Supersede Beijing's Atrocities 
""Not my lane” should never come out of the mouth of a U.S. official to excuse the slavery, torture, and genocide being committed by Communist China.

CBP Agents Are Being Pulled Off the Frontlines

 Celebrating National Police Week
This week is National Police Week – a time to honor the heroes in blue who serve our communities and pay tribute to those who have given their life keeping us safe. In Southeast Texas, we are blessed with some of the finest law enforcement officers in the nation. From our County Sheriffs to our Game Wardens, I personally couldn’t be more thankful and proud of the men and women who protect our communities.

To all the men and women in uniform – past and present – we thank you. God Bless you, your families, and the entire law enforcement community.

 Biden's Given the Cartels Total Control Over Our Border
 Cartels are purposefully choosing open, wall-less areas to smuggle migrants across – exhausting CBP personnel/resources and leaving us vulnerable.

Because of his inaction, Biden's given the cartels total control over our border.

5/9/21 8:32,Happy Mother’s Day!,"Dear Friend,
 
When we celebrated Mother’s Day last year, it was under trying circumstances, and my thoughts and prayers are with every family coming together today – virtually or in person – with an empty chair at the table because of this virus.
 
We’ve come a long way since last May, and thanks to your efforts and that of so many in our community, we’re getting closer to the light at the end of the tunnel.
 
My family is incredibly fortunate. My mom and dad were vaccinated shortly after they became eligible, and my husband and I were able to do the same. That means we’ll be celebrating together in person today, and let me tell you, I couldn’t be more excited!
 

 Now, in the spirit of Mother’s Day, I wouldn’t be doing my job as a mom if I didn’t remind you that if you or someone you know hasn’t gotten their shot yet, we need that to change. Vaccines are available at facilities across the Commonwealth, including walkup appointments available at mass vaccination sites starting tomorrow and in CVS Pharmacies in most cities and towns.
 
Please go get your shot and encourage your family, friends and neighbors to do the same. These vaccines are our most effective tool in defeating COVID-19 and shortening our road to recovery.
 
In the meantime, I hope you’ll join me in wishing the moms in your life a happy and healthy Mother’s Day.
 
Warm regards,

An Update From Your Congresswoman

Dear Neighbor,

I hope that you had a safe Thanksgiving, even if this year's holiday didn't look like previous years. As we move through the holiday season, it has never been more important for all of us to continue protecting each other by wearing masks, physically distancing, and limiting our travel and exposure. It is my urgent wish that all of us, and our loved ones, will be able to remain healthy as we look forward to next year and a vaccine. I continue to urge you to follow the CDC guidelines, which can be found here.

If you or a loved one is struggling financially this holiday season due to the economic crisis caused by covid-19, please know that help is available. There is information later in this newsletter regarding resources that may be available to you. A full list of resources and frequently asked questions can be found here. If you need help, please call my office at 321-388-9808.

If you do not currently have health care, or want to make sure you have the most cost-effective plan, remember that we are currently in the signup period for coverage under the Affordable Care Act. You can sign up for health care until December 15th at www.healthcare.gov.



I am deeply honored that last month I was re-elected to serve as your congresswoman. I am eager to continue the work of fighting for you and our community. It is also my pleasure to congratulate President-Elect Biden and Vice President-Elect Harris. There is much important work to do.

I continue to believe that Congress' #1 priority must be to pass additional covid relief before the end of the year. We in the House have passed multiple pieces of legislation to provide financial assistance to American individuals and small businesses. It is outrageous that these bills have been held up in the Senate, but it is not too late for the Senate to pass real relief.

However, while we work towards this critical relief, I am also continuing to work on other important legislative priorities, as well as our work to keep families whole and in their homes here in the district.

My job is to serve you. If there is anything with which I or my staff can assist, please contact my office. Remember to see the bottom of this email for local resources if you are struggling financially.

Stay strong, stay safe, and be well.

Sincerely,

U.S. Rep. Val Demings

Voting and the Ocoee Massacre

As we went to the polls last month to exercise our sacred right to vote, we also remembered the 100th anniversary of the Ocoee Massacre, in which hundreds of Black people in Ocoee were killed or driven from their homes after a mob formed to stop these Americans from voting. One man, Julius ""July"" Perry, was known in the community for helping his neighbors register to vote. He was lynched. Local playwright Glenn Barbour researched July Perry's story, and you can hear it here.



It is important that we know and understand our history and I want to thank the Orlando Sentinel and Orange County Regional History Center for the countless hours of research and interviews on the Ocoee Massacre. The exhibit at the History Center was powerful and unforgettable.

As we look back on this tragic event, we must recognize that voter suppression is still ongoing today. In honor of those who have died, as well as those who put their lives on the line to expand these rights to all of us, I have cosponsored the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to protect these rights for every American, and I continue to call on the Senate to allow a vote on this critical legislation.

Honoring Veterans Day

President John F. Kennedy said, ""Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.""

We honor and thank our veterans for their service.



Thank you to all who have served.

Our Work in Congress

While we continue to fight for meaningful COVID-19 relief for you and for our community, I have also worked on other initiatives, including legislation to:
	•	Fund programs to help Americans recover from opioid addiction
	•	Ensure excellent and equal care for Native veterans
	•	Enable the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to collect important data to protect from storms and other weather events
	•	Fund environmental science education programs on ocean and lake management
	•	Update and fix the Veterans Affairs websites and ensure that they are accessible to veterans with disabilities.
	•	Update labeling rules for generic medication
	•	Prevent drug companies from restricting the availability of medication for rare conditions
	•	Authorize funding for hospitals to help patients suffering from domestic violence
	•	Stop scammers from targeting older individuals
	•	Report on the impact of covid-19 on the tourism industry
	•	Expand access to housing disaster aid
	•	Expand childcare availability as part of economic development plans
	•	Create a National Children's Museum in Washington, D.C.
	•	Condemn acts by China to trample human rights and democracy in Hong Kong
	•	Partner with international bodies on vaccine development
	•	Expand democratic governance, free elections, and stability in Libya through non-military means
	•	Support efforts in Haiti to strengthen freedom of the press, anti-corruption, civil liberties, human rights, development, and disaster recovery
	•	Condemn Russia's poisoning of anticorruption activist and political opposition leader Alexei Navalny 
	•	Reduce and prevent plastic waste in our oceans

REMINDER: Open Enrollment for 2021 Ends TODAY
Dear Friend, 
Today marks the end of HealthCare.gov’s open enrollment period for 2021. Once you sign up, you will get coverage that starts on January 1, 2021. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has altered many aspects of our lives, and cost over 300,000 Americans their lives. Unfortunately, we are in the middle of the largest wave of infections we have seen since this pandemic began. Health insurance can protect you and your family from astronomical costs when a serious accident or illness occurs.  
While a vaccine for COVID-19 has just been approved for emergency use, it will still be a few months before the vaccine can be widely distributed. We must do all we can to protect ourselves and limit the spread of COVID-19 until then, including wearing masks, observing social distancing, and washing our hands regularly. Getting covered and having comprehensive health insurance is another smart choice. Be careful though, official Obamacare policies are only available at HealthCare.gov. Policies found elsewhere may not provide the full benefits and protections of the Affordable Care Act. 
Take the time to learn about your options, and if you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact my District Office at 757-380-1000. 
Very truly yours,    ROBERT C. ""BOBBY"" SCOTT Member of Congress

2,556 doses of COVID-19 vaccine were administered in the Marianas this week, bringing the total to 15,527. That’s 363 shots on Rota, 401 on Tinian, and 14,763 on Saipan. Presently, our Man Amko’ (age 65+), homebound healthcare patients, and Individuals working in high risk healthcare and first responder settings are eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine on all islands. In Saipan, individuals who are 55-years-old and workers critical to the Marianas infrastructure across the public and private sector are also eligible. Please visit VaccinateCNMI.com to determine when you are eligible and for the most up-to-date information on the COVID-19 vaccination effort in the Marianas. 
 

Vaccine for Kagman Health Center

Kagman Community Health Center is one of 250 Federally Qualified Health Centers nationwide selected to participate in the Ensuring Equity in COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution program, the Health Resources and Services Administration announced on Tuesday. After verifying participation and capability, Kagman Community Health Center will be able to receive and administer COVID-19 vaccines. These will be in addition to the doses already being sent to the Marianas each month. That means more of us will be vaccinated more quickly. The doses provided will be separate from vaccines already being allocated to the Marianas each month and should mean more of us will be vaccinated more quickly. Congratulations, Kagman Health Center! 
 
 

USDA: $62m expected for NAP. The Marianas Nutrition Assistance Program should have $62,222,036 available going forward, according to data provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (above). I met with the new Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, Stacy Dean, on Thursday to get a commitment from the Biden administration that we would work on including the Marianas in SNAP, the national food aid program, during this Congress; and she shared this accounting of the funds available to complete the transition. Ms. Dean and I both worked on the 2014 Farm Bill, which provided $30.5 million for the Marianas SNAP pilot program and resulted in more households being eligible and higher benefits, including differentials for Rota and Tinian to account for higher food costs there. 
 

$10.3m for NMTI training facility

The new Biden administration continued to clear the backlog of Marianas disaster recovery aid applications with a $10.3 million award to the Northern Marianas Technical Institute on Thursday. NMTI applied for the money to build a new training facility in September 2019, just a few months after we made the money available in U.S. Public Law 116-20; but the Economic Development Administration took no action, until now. The typhoon-proofed, new building will house classrooms and offices to support the NMTI trades program, which is especially needed as we continue the multi-year task of rebuilding from Super Typhoon Yutu. 410 jobs are forecast to be created as a result of this investment in training. Together with the recently announced grants to Northern Marianas College, EDA is confirming my long-held belief that investing in education is key to our economic future and one of the best ways for us to build back better. 
 

$5.8m for Marianas airports

The Commonwealth Ports Authority will get $5,823,963 from the relief package we passed in December, the Federal Aviation Administration announced this week. The Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act provided this financial aid to U.S. airports and eligible concessionaires to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The FAA is distributing the funds to airports based on the number of annual boardings. The $5,823,963 allocated to CPA is further distributed, as follows:  
	•	Francisco C Ada/Saipan International – $3,785,813
	•	Tinian International – $1,022,851
	•	Benjamin Taisacan Manglona International – $1,006,299
	•	Pagan Airstrip – $9,000

Congratulations, CPA!
 
 

Rescue Plan: $515m for NMI government

Final allocations for insular areas governments from the American Rescue Plan were released this week by the Committee on Oversight and Reform. The Commonwealth government should receive $483,000,000 to replace operational funds lost because of the pandemic and address other negative economic impacts. And the Rota, Tinian, Saipan, and Northern Islands municipalities will share $32,000,000 for a total of $515,000,000. The funds may be transferred to private nonprofit organizations, public benefit corporations involved in transportation, and special-purpose units of government. Oversight and Reform is just one of many committees, which have submitted their spending plans to the House Budget Committee for compilation this week into the American Rescue Plan. That legislation goes to the House for a vote next week. At the same time, and in coordination with the House and the White House, Senate staff have been working with their Parliamentarian to make sure the compiled text meets the specific requirements that apply to a reconciliation measure in the Senate, and can be passed by a simple majority vote there. 
 
 

Renewing old friendships. Alejandro Mayorkas was sworn in as Secretary of Homeland Security earlier this month by Vice President Kamala Harris; and he reached out to renew the relationship he and I built when he led the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Obama administration. In our conversation on Wednesday I reminded him of his phone calls to me on two separate Thanksgiving Days to let me know he was extending humanitarian parole to people in the Marianas caught in the immigration transition. I look forward to working with the new Secretary on the Biden administration’s U.S. Citizenship Act. 
 
 

Marianas in U.S. Citizenship Act

Rep. Linda Sanchez and Sen. Robert Menendez introduced yesterday President Biden’s vision for modernizing immigration, the U.S. Citizenship Act, which includes special provisions for the Marianas I helped draft with the Biden transition team last year. The Act incorporates elements of my bill, H.R. 560, that grant permanent status to certain CW workers and foreign investors in the Marianas. The Act, also, makes certain noncitizens, including many in the Marianas, eligible for a new “Law Prospective Immigrant” status. LPI status provides lawful presence and work authorization, is valid for six years, and may be extended for an additional six years. After a minimum of five years in LPI status, an individual may be eligible for U.S. lawful permanent residence. Other provisions address backlogs in the immigrant visa system by recapturing unused visas, and adjusting certain per-country limits and create an exemption from worldwide visa limits for children of certain Filipino veterans. I am an original co-sponsor of the U.S. Citizenship Act. 
 

CNMI permanent resident update

In preparation for my meeting with Secretary Mayorkas the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services provided an update on applications for the CNMI Permanent Resident status that I created in U.S. Public Law 116-24. It has been over a year and half since the law was enacted. Of the 2,898 applications submitted, eight have been denied and 29 approved. That leaves 2,861 people still waiting. USCIS is trying to reduce that backlog, including by distributing the workload to more field offices. But, the agency says, it is facing numerous challenges due to COVID-19, including the closure of the Saipan Application Service Center, where biometric data is collected, and a high rate of Requests for Evidence to demonstrate eligibility for the new permanent resident status. The agency’s current COVID flexibilities do allow an additional 60 days beyond the normal 12-week response requirement for applicants to respond to RFEs. 
 

VA extends debt collection pause

On Thursday, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced the continuing suspension of collection on all veteran benefit overpayments and medical co-payment debts incurred after April 1, 2020 as part of its ongoing effort to provide veterans relief during the COVID-19 pandemic. The extension ends September 30, 2021. Veterans will receive notification of their current debt and expansive relief options which include extending repayment plans, waivers, compromises, and temporary hardship suspensions. For information about benefit overpayments, veterans and beneficiaries can view the Frequently Asked Questions, submit an online request, or call 1-800-827-0648. Veterans with questions about health care co-payment debts should contact the Health Resource Center at 1-866-400-1238. 
 
 

Returning as Vice Chair. Democratic Members of the Natural Resources Committee held a virtual organizing meeting Wednesday to select vice chairs and subcommittee chairs for the 117th Congress. I was chosen once again to serve as Vice Chair for Insular Affairs, a position I held last Congress when it was first created. I want to thank Chair Raúl Grijalva for recognizing the importance of giving the insular areas this voice on the Committee. Many of the issues we face are shared with other areas of our nation – climate change, for instance. Often, however, these problems are accentuated by geography, culture, or our unequal political representation. As Vice Chair in the last Congress, I was able to hold a hearing on the Medicaid funding crisis the islands faced; and the crisis was averted. I hope to use this position as effectively in the 117th Congress. I will also serve on the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands which could prove pivotal in this Congress as we expect to receive official recommendation on the suitability of a Rota National Historical Park from the Secretary of the Interior. 
 
 

Congressional Award Info Sessions. I encourage young people between the ages of 13 ½ and 24 to take part in the Congressional Award program. The Congressional Award is the highest award that Congress bestows on young people. It is not a competition, but rather something every individual can earn by meeting goals in personal development, physical fitness, public service, and exploration. Your congressional office will be hosting two virtual info sessions for new and current Marianas participants. You can RSVP for the February 25 session for current participants here. To RSVP for the March 4 session for new participants, please click here.

5/21/21 18:45,Housing Resource Fair and Helpful Programs,"Dear Friend,
In an effort to make sure my constituents are aware of special programs, events, grants, and other opportunities, I have compiled this resource newsletter. I hope you find it useful and informative.    In particular, I'd like to draw your attention to the virtual housing resource fair I will be hosting next week. This is a chance to learn about new housing and rental assistance programs — including many made possible by the American Rescue Plan — and get individual assistance with a wide range of housing issues. 
It's an honor to serve as your Congressman. As always, don't hesitate to reach out to my office if we can assist you. You can call my Chicago office between 9AM and 6PM, Monday through Friday, at (773) 779-2400.
Sincerely, 
  Bobby L. Rush Member of Congress 

Housing Resources 
Are you a homeowner or renter who wants to take advantage of new COVID-19 assistance programs? Are you interested in purchasing a home? I am hosting a weeklong virtual housing resource fair with workshops with local housing agencies, banks, and other experts.   Tune in for our kickoff event Monday, May 24th at 5PM via Zoom or Facebook. Visit Rush.House.Gov/HousingFair for the full list of programming, and keep reading for other housing, rental, and utility assistance resources.  The Help for Illinois Families Initiative is a program offered through the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (IDCEO). Click HERE for assistance paying for rent, utilities, food, and more.    If you are a landlord with a tenant who is behind on rental payments or a tenant who is behind on rental payments, the new Illinois Rental Payment Program can provide up to $25,000 in emergency rental assistance which includes three months of future rent payments. Landlords must initiate the application. More information is HERE.   Small Accessible Repairs for Seniors (SARFS): This program from the City of Chicago provides improvements including grab bars, lever faucets, door repairs, carbon monoxide detectors, smoke detectors, and wheelchair ramps to help senior citizens remain in their homes. Seniors aged 60+  who reside in 1-4 unit structures may be eligible. Learn more HERE and find the delegate agency in your ward, who can assist with the application process, HERE.   The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) helps eligible low-income households pay for home energy services. Click HERE for more information or call the Illinois LIHEAP Hotline at 1-877-411-9276.   The Utility Billing Relief Program provides low-income City of Chicago residents with a reduced rate on their water, sewer, and water-sewer tax as well as debt relief for those who demonstrate they can manage the reduced rate bills for one year.   Cook County residents can also apply for utility assistance through the Community and Economic Development Association of Cook County, Inc. (CEDA). More information is HERE.  

I was glad to have the opportunity to attend the groundbreaking ceremony for Bronzeville Winery, a new Black-owned business on the South Side.
Community Bulletin
Monthly payments from the newly-expanded Child Tax Credit (CTC) in the American Rescue Plan, will begin on July 15th.   More than 88% of children in the First Congressional District will benefit from the Child Tax Credit, which I proudly voted for in Congress. After the first payment on July 15th, subsequent CTC payments will be made on the 15th of each month, or the next weekday following the 15th if the 15th is on a weekend or holiday. Eligible families will receive a monthly payment of up to $300 for each child under age 6 and up to $250 per month for each child ages 6-17.
Scholarship Programs   The CEDA Scholarship Program offers up to $3,000 in financial aid for income-eligible Suburban Cook County residents who demonstrate academic achievement, career potential, and motivation. Learn more and apply HERE.   The Next Generation of Black and Hispanic Farmers Scholarship (NGBHF) Program application deadline for the upcoming academic year is June 15, 2021. New this year, the NGBHF Scholarship Program will award up to 25 scholarships to Black and Hispanic graduating high school seniors who plan to enroll, or are enrolled, in an agriculture program of study at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln with a commitment to engage in the family farm operation after graduation.   Remember, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, no payments are required on federal student loans owned by the U.S. Department of Education, and interest rates on those loans are zero percent, until September 30, 2021. More information for students, schools, and families HERE. 
Grant Opportunities 
Eligible organizations can now submit grant applications for the Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) and Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) programs through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Organizations can apply online at Grants.gov through June 4, 2021.  In 2021, the IRS awarded 31 TCE grantees $11 million and 297 VITA grantees $25 million. The two programs prepare millions of tax returns each year. 
COVID-19 Funeral Assistance 
The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)'s COVID-19 Funeral Assistance Program can provide financial assistance for COVID-19 related funeral expenses incurred after January 20, 2020. You can apply for funeral assistance by calling 844-684-6333 between 8AM and 8PM CT, Monday through Friday.

Art Competition 

The deadline for my annual Congressional Art Competition has been extended to June 11!

If you are a high school student in the First District, don't miss this chance to have your winning piece of artwork displayed in the U.S. House of Representatives. The top ten pieces will be displayed for a two-week exhibit at the Connect Gallery in Hyde Park, with a reception for the artists and their families and an awards ceremony.

The artwork you submit does not have to be specifically created for this competition — any piece done during the school year can be submitted. A student release form must accompany each submission, and submissions must be delivered to my Chicago office by 5PM on June 11. More information is HERE.

I recently toured the mass vaccination site at Chicago State University and was proud to see the incredible work being done there to get our community vaccinated!
Vaccination Information 

Every Illinois resident age 12+ is eligible for a free COVID-19 vaccine. You can text your zip code to GETVAX (438829) to find the COVID-19 vaccination location nearest you. 

You can also visit my website at Rush.House.Gov/Vaccine for information on vaccination and COVID-19 testing sites in the First District.

Need help getting to a vaccination site?

Uber is providing up to $40 in free ride credits after you book a vaccine appointment at the United Center mass vaccination site at Zocdoc.com/Vaccine. 

Beware of Vaccine-Related Fraud!  

Once you get your COVID-19 vaccine, make sure you keep your vaccination card safe. Do not share a photo of your COVID-19 vaccination card online or on social media. Scammers may try to steal your personal information, including date of birth or health care details, from the content you post. 

You should get a COVID-19 vaccination card at your first vaccine appointment. If you didn't, contact the provider site where you got vaccinated or your state health department to get a card. 

If someone contacts you trying to buy or sell a vaccination card, it's a scam. If you suspect COVID-19-related fraud, report it online or call 800-HHS-TIPS (800-447-8477).

In other health care news, you may be eligible for more savings and lower costs on health insurance through HealthCare.Gov because of expanded subsidies included in the American Rescue Plan. 

The American Rescue Plan also extended the special enrollment period for health insurance coverage. You now have through August 15, 2021 to enroll.

In the News: Fed leaders more optimistic on jobs, GDP growth at final 2020 policy meeting
 
 
Washington Post: 

""Federal Reserve leaders are more optimistic about jobs and growth than at any point in the pandemic, yet critical holes in the recovery remain, and filling them may hinge on a stimulus deal and the rollout of a coronavirus vaccine.

""At a news conference after the Fed's final policy meeting of 2020, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank was not out of tools to support the recovery, and could expand its asset purchases. But for sectors that are far from healed - such as restaurants and hotels that rely on person-to-person contact - 'those are not being held back by financial conditions, but rather by the spread of the virus,' Powell said.""

Associated Press: 

""As COVID-19 vaccinations roll out to more and more people, health authorities are keeping close watch for any unexpected side effects.

On Tuesday, a health worker in Alaska suffered a severe allergic reaction after receiving the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She is in the hospital for another night under observation while another worker, vaccinated Wednesday, has recovered. Doctors already knew to be on the lookout after Britain reported two similar cases last week.""

NEW VIDEO: Reflections on 40 years of 99 county meetings

For 40 years, I’ve crisscrossed Iowa, holding Q&As in every county, every year. My 99 county meetings keep me in touch with Iowans so I can bring their ideas to the policy-making tables in Washington.  
Q&A: Counterfeit Vaccines and Pandemic Fraud

Q: What are you doing to protect taxpayer dollars included in the pandemic relief laws? 
Q: Do you have pandemic fraud on your radar that Iowans ought to be watching out for? 
Quick Links
While this past year has been challenging for us all, serving the people of Iowa is my first priority and it’s an honor that I take seriously. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and through my extensive oversight efforts, my work focuses on making the government more transparent, efficient and accountable to Iowans and all Americans.

Weekly Wrap-Up with 
Congressman Byron Donalds
February 8, 2021
 
 
Last week, I witnessed firsthand why Congress has a terrible approval rating and why our body is labeled a ""do-nothing Congress."" During a pandemic, when millions of Americans are out of work and struggling to make ends meet, Democrat leadership spent most of the week engaging in partisan games non of which were aimed at benefiting the American people. While we were actually working, Speaker Pelosi brought a multi-trillion-dollar budget to the floor through the partisan process of reconciliation. Politicians in Washington can not continue to operate as if America's treasury dollar grows off trees. 
 
Navigating throughout Congress in the minority party will not be easy, but I did not come to Washington to sit on my hands. Every day I serve as your Congressman, I will not take for granted. While in session, I joined my fellow members on the Oversight and Reform and Small Business committees for our first committee meetings of the 177th Congress where we worked to find common-sense solutions to the problems facing the small business owners and the efficiency of our government. Also, I took part in my first speech on the House floor, where I called on members across the aisle to object to the budget reconciliation process that subverts half of America's voices. I also sent a letter to the United States Department of Homeland Security calling on Secretary Mayorkas and the Biden Administration to halt any plans to vaccinate illegal immigrants. Florida's 19th Congressional District is taking center stage in our nation's capital, and I am proud to represent all of you.
 

 
 
""Black History is America's History""
 
In honor of Black History Month, and in a call for unity, I penned an Op-Ed on the significance of Black History in America. The Op-Ed was featured in the Washington Examiner. You can read the Op-Ed in its entirety below:
 
""February marks the beginning of a historic time that recognizes black Americans' contributions to our nation's great story. While we dedicate this month as Black History Month, the black community's impact on America is appreciated and recognized endlessly.
 
As one of three black Republicans in Congress and the first black American to represent my district, my rise from inner-city Brooklyn to the halls of Congress is living proof of our great nation's promise. Although the founding of our constitutional republic did not live up to the words of our founding documents, we have progressed as a nation to honor these sacred words: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.""
 
America's storied history is woven together by the significant contributions of the black community. From the western shores of Africa to the shores of America, through the atrocity of slavery and the continued suppression during segregation and Jim Crow, our history, while at times very dark and tumultuous, represents the grit and resilience embodied by generations of black Americans.
 
We can celebrate Black History Month today because of the fortitude and fearless conviction of patriots such as Sojourner Truth, who risked her life to recruit black troops for the Union Army, and through the powerful words of W.E.B Du Bois. As black Americans continued to fight for their rights, it was the teachings and leadership of the ""First Lady of the Struggle,"" Mary McLeod Bethune, that educated and empowered countless black Americans.
 
While black athletes fought to play on a level playing field in professional sports, it was the perseverance of Jackie Robinson that made it a reality. When blacks faced unequal justice under the law for decades, it took the will of Associate Justice Clarence Thomas, a descendant of slaves, to rise and become only the second black man ever to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.
 
As a nation, we have come so far, but that does not mean our work is finished. As an elected official, I continue to strive to enhance and empower my community with policies that end generational poverty and bring forth actions that enable, spur, and encourage a pathway to the American Dream.
 
By prioritizing access to capital initiatives, criminal justice reform, school choice, standing up for life, encouraging fathers in the home, and economic freedom, the black community can and will reach its highest potential. During Black History Month, we pay homage to those who dedicated their lives to advancing the lives of black Americans and reaffirm our commitment to remaining the land of the free and the home of the brave.""
 
Byron Donalds represents Florida's 19th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives.

 
 
Speech on the House Floor
 
 
On Wednesday, February 3rd, Congress convened to debate the COVID-19 budget resolution proposed by President Biden and Senate and House Democrat leaders. I was honored to give a speech on the floor of the United States House of Representatives for the first time. 
 
“This budget resolution is not about economics, and it’s not about COVID-19, it’s not about helping our schools reopen. This budget resolution is pure politics. It is an opportunity to push through an agenda through budget reconciliation,” Mr. Donalds criticized the fiscally irresponsible $2.1 trillion budget proposal, “If you want to help state and local governments take care of their revenue problems, they should open up.”
 
Watch the speech in its entirety below: 
 
 
 

 
 

 
 
""Black GOP Lawmakers Call on National Museum of African American History to Honor 
Justice Clarence Thomas""
 
 
Being only one of three African-American Republicans currently serving in Congress, I was honored to join Senator Tim Scott and Congressman Burgess Owens in a letter to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History to properly honor the life and legacy of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. 
 
""As a Black man who has a profound respect for the contributions Justice Thomas has propitiated for generations to come, this museum must encapsulate his life as it does for hundreds of other monumental Black figures,"" I wrote, stating that, the museum ""falls short"" of representing Justice Thomas' ""achievements and life compared to his counterpart, the Honorable Justice Thurgood Marshall.""
 
I would like to thank Kay C. James, Paris Dennard, Bruce Levell, Dr. Alveda King, and Marc Little in supporting this letter in this effort.

In the Media
 
On February 4th, I joined Fox News' America Reports with John Roberts and Sandra Smith to discuss the fiscally irresponsible COVID-19 budget package proposed by President Biden and Democrat leaders on Capitol Hill.

Legislative Updates
 
 
The Biden Administration has set a troubling standard as to who receives a COVID-19 vaccine. In the first few weeks of the Biden presidency, we have continuously seen the American people be put last. Because of this, last week I sent a letter to Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas calling on the Department any effort to prioritize vaccinating illegal migrant populations over the American people.

Congressman Donalds Pens Letter to Secretary of Homeland Security
 
 

 
As a new member of the House Committee on Government Oversight and Reform, am excited to join the Civil Rights and Civil Liberties & Economic and Consumer Policy subcommittees. A good government requires a commitment to expose waste, fraud, and abuse, and I will ensure Washington is working for you.
 

 
This global pandemic  has devastated countless families, along with our economy. The fiscally irresponsible budget measure of this magnitude proposed by the Biden Administration is detrimental to the nation's fiscal welfare & national security. 
 
On February 2nd, I sent a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.

	•	Lee County ($2,820,983) – harden several roofing systems, and secure the HVAC systems of Lee County’s Waste to Energy facility.

 
 
Serving the hardworking men and women of Florida's 19th Congressional District is my distinct honor and privilege. It's time Washington works for our community's values, and every day I will always strive to ensure your government is working for you. 
 
Sincerely,

Dear Friend,  Congratulations to the Marshall University men's soccer team on winning the national championship this week! West Virginia is so proud. Go Herd!
 
I am happy to announce that legislation I sponsored to improve veteran safety at VA hospitals passed in the House of Representatives this week. The Veterans' Camera Reporting Act was introduced by Reps. David McKinley, Alex Mooney and myself. It will require the United States Department of Veterans Affairs to complete and submit a report to Congress regarding the use of cameras in VA medical facilities and how they can be better utilized to provide high quality health care to America’s heroes. This is a huge step forward in ensuring our nation's veterans receive the best health care possible, and that the tragic events we saw at the Clarksburg and Beckley VA hospitals never happen again.
 
Additionally this week, I took action against Biden's absurd tax hikes. First, I introduced the Saving Gig Economy Taxpayers Act to help our gig economy workers by repealing the unnecessary tax hikes hidden in the Biden Administration's COVID-19 relief package.
 
I also participated in a Ways and Means Committee hearing about President Biden's proposed tax increases in his partisan infrastructure package. This legislation will cut jobs, decrease private investment, kneecap innovation, and ship American jobs overseas. Watch my full remarks here.
 
Our nation is in need of effective COVID-19 relief as well as an infrastructure overhaul, but raising taxes on hardworking Americans is not the way to accomplish either.

The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Services has a dashboard for all COVID-19 concerns.

Opposing Undermining of Private Property Rights 
This week, I expressed my strong opposition to U.S. Department of Interior Secretary Deb Haaland regarding any plan that would undermine private property rights under the Biden administration’s 30 by 30 initiative to conserve at least 30 percent of U.S. lands and 30 percent of U.S. waters by 2030. I called on Secretary Haaland to consider how this initiative could impact Kansans as recommendations are developed, and urged the Biden administration to provide Congress with additional details on how it plans to pursue the 30 by 30 initiative.  Kansans are rightfully alarmed about possible implications for private property owners of any federal mandate to set aside vast swaths of land in response to this executive order. In addition to being troubled about diminishing private property rights, I am concerned that taking farm and ranch land out of production will damage local and regional economies across Kansas. Agricultural and energy production is the most common use of private lands in Kansas, driving the state’s economy and providing jobs and economic opportunities in rural communities. It is critical for the Biden administration to uphold the integrity of private property rights and recognize the important economic contributions of agricultural and energy production on our lands. Since over 98 percent of land in Kansas is privately owned, private property rights are critical for our state and will continue to be a significant priority of mine in Congress. 
  
Improving Local and Regional Airports  
Hearing from Airport Leaders Regarding the Ongoing Impacts Caused by COVID-19  This week, I visited Hays Regional Airport to hear from Airport Manager Jamie Salter regarding the impact the pandemic has had on their operation and view the structures they have remodeled recently to protect their staff from COVID-19. I recently announced a $1 million FAA grant for this airport supported by the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations (CRRSA) Act, which I voted for and was signed into law in December 2020. Airports across the nation have struggled as travel was limited during the pandemic, but I was pleased to hear additional flights returned to service in Hays at the beginning of the year. 
 Hays Regional airport is utilized by many local businesses for general aviation, and the airport is important for their continued success. I appreciated hearing from Alan Moore, Marty Patterson and Jason Staab with local businesses about how important general aviation is to the region and from Fix Based Operator Chris Springer.  It was also helpful to hear from Mayor Sandy Jacobs, Vice Mayor Mason Ruder, City Manager Toby Dougherty, Assistant City Manager Collin Bielser and City Commissioner Shaun Musil about the impact the airport has on the area and the initiatives they are focusing on in Hays. Thank you to each of them for sharing their experiences and thoughts with me.  Read more about my visit here in the Hays Daily News. 
  
Visiting Garden City Regional Airport  I also visited Garden City Regional Airport (GCK) where I met with Director of Aviation Rachelle Powell to discuss how COVID-19 has affected their operations, flight schedules and passenger levels. Regional economies across Kansas rely on the aviation industry and airports like Garden City in order to connect Kansas communities across the state and nation.  Earlier this month, I introduced legislation to allow retired FAA controllers to work at federal contract towers without facing a financial penalty, and Garden City is among eight contract towers in Kansas this legislation would affect. Thank you to Airport Advisory Board members and frequent flyers Charlie Robinson and Aaron Anderson, Director of Public Utilities Mike Muirhead, Garden City Chamber of Commerce President Myca Bunch, County Commissioners Larry Jones, Lon Pishny, Manny Ortiz, Shannon Dick, local leaders Janene Radke and Cecelia Douglass, and Garden City Chief of Police Courtney Prewitt for joining me. Read more here from KSN.

This week, I announced over $17 million in U.S. Department of Transportation grants for 28 Kansas regional airports for repairs and upgrades.

Meeting with Law Enforcement Officials 
Announcing the Results of Operation Frontier Justice  I was in Topeka on Monday for a press conference to discuss the success of Operation Frontier Justice – a national initiative focused on reducing violent crime. Together, law enforcement helped address the rise in violent crimes that were occurring in the Topeka area, including more than 100 felony arrests and seizures of illegal narcotics. The operation was carried out in close collaboration with numerous government agencies including the United States Marshal Service, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the Drug Enforcement Administration, Topeka Police Department, Shawnee County Sheriff’s Office, Shawnee County District Attorney, Kansas Highway Patrol and the United States Attorney’s Office.  I want to especially thank U.S. Marshal Ron Miller, Shawnee County Sheriff Brian Hill and Topeka Police Chief Bryan Wheeles for their work in making this operation a success. I will continue to support law enforcement at the federal and local level to make certain they have the resources they need to keep our communities safe.

Meeting with New Police Chiefs Across Kansas  I was pleased to meet three new police chiefs across the state this week. I want to thank Great Bend Police Chief Steve Haulmark, Garden City Police Chief Courtney Prewitt and Olathe Police Chief Mike Butaud for taking the time to meet with me to discuss public safety within each of their communities. Each individual brings a diverse and important perspective to the communities they serve. As the lead Republican on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Department of Justice, I have made it my priority to make certain that local police departments across Kansas have the resources they need to protect our communities. I look forward to continuing to meet with law enforcement officers across the state. I thank them for their service to their communities and all they do to keep their fellow Kansans safe. 
  
 
  
Amtrak’s Southwest Chief Reinstates Full, Seven-Day Service 
This week, I met with City Manager Matt Allen and city, county and economic development officials at the depot in Garden City to discuss passenger ridership and Amtrak’s move to reinstate full service to its Southwest Chief passenger line, which is anticipated for May 31. I have long been an advocate of the Southwest Chief and supporter of long-distance passenger rail. Since the onset of the pandemic, I have been in contact with Amtrak leaders regarding the company’s plan to ultimately restore daily long-distance passenger services knowing how valuable the Southwest Chief is to Kansans and will remain in contact with Amtrak as they move toward the May 31 date. 
 Our conversation provided a useful reminder of how essential long-distance passenger service routes like the Chief are for connecting rural Kansas communities to major cities and economic opportunities. Thank you to Matt Allen, Garden City officials, Finney County officials and the Garden City Chamber for the discussion. Read more about my visit to Garden City here in the Garden City Telegram. 
  
Protecting Veterans from Disruptions to Telehealth Services 
This week, I joined U.S. Representative Mike Bost, as ranking members of the Senate and House Veterans’ Affairs Committees, in urging Secretary of Veterans Affairs Denis McDonough to find a solution that will ensure veterans in California are not negatively impacted by California’s new law, the Internet Consumer Protection and Net Neutrality Act of 2018. Currently, mobile carriers have agreements with the VA to provide VA Video Connect services to veterans at a reduced cost. These telehealth services provide care for veterans who are unable to receive VA health care in person. Under California’s new law, these sort of agreements between mobile careers and the VA could be prohibited, disrupting service to veterans.  Due to the complexities involved with a service that is not limited to state boundaries, this provision in California’s law has the potential to negatively impact the ability of mobile carriers to continue providing VA Video Connect services to veterans not only in that state but across the country. Click here to read the full letter. 
  
Vaccine Production in Kansas 
Visiting Pfizer’s McPherson Manufacturing Site  While in McPherson this week, I visited the Pfizer manufacturing site to tour the facility and meet with local leadership.  It is great to see the incredible work Kansans are doing to produce the COVID-19 vaccine for our country and the world. Thank you to Pfizer McPherson Site Leader Ian MacKellar for the tour and update, as well as McPherson Mayor Tom Brown for joining us. 
  
 
  
Local Pharmacies Facilitate the Vaccination Process and Returning to Normal
Following my visit to Pfizer, I stopped by the local Walgreens in McPherson where the pharmacy was hosting a Health Equity COVID-19 clinic vaccinating Kansans with the Pfizer vaccine. It was great to speak with Walgreens Health Care Supervisor Brad Seiler and Store Manager Larry Showalter about their extended hours, increasing accessibility to the vaccine for local residents, as well as their rapid testing program. As we continue to focus on getting more shots in more arms, familiar and convenient access points like local pharmacies play a key role in helping us return to normal. 
  
 
  
Meeting with Western Plains Medical in Dodge City 
This week, I also visited Western Plains Medical Complex in Dodge City where hospital administrators updated me on their COVID-19 vaccination process at the hospital and across rural southwest Kansas. The facility was among the first to receive early Pfizer vaccine shipments in December 2020, and I was able to see how the facility has since set up its clinic to vaccinate Ford County residents. We also discussed my recent bill to vaccinate veterans and their spouses and the importance of accessible rural health care, especially as communities across Kansas continue their vaccine rollout.  Thank you to Assistant Administrator Jeremy Rabe, as well as Chamber President Anna Bjerken, Ford County Economic Development Director Joann Knight and Western Plains CFO Mark Murray for taking time to visit with me as they continue to work to get Kansans vaccinated. 
  
 
  
Meeting with The University of Kansas Health System Leaders in Topeka 
I met with leadership at The University of Kansas Health System St. Francis Campus in Topeka and toured their new Cancer Center and Emergency Department. Both the Cancer Center and Emergency Department were very impressive, especially the new Linear Accelerator which will be operational this spring. It was also great to see how they have adapted their emergency room so they can continue to safely see patients during the pandemic.  We also discussed the importance of telehealth, vaccine distribution and NIH research, and I’m pleased they are able to recruit some of the best doctors in the country to The University of Kansas Health System. Through their efficient vaccine program, they are working diligently to get shots administered while also taking the necessary precautions to keep the hospital safe for patients seeking routine care.  Thank you to Steve Anderson for the tour and to all the doctors and nurses who continue to go above and beyond to care for Kansans during the pandemic. 
  

  
Salina’s Ashby House Aids and Empowers Homeless Individuals and Families 
I visited the Ashby House in Salina this week, a non-profit founded in 1992 that assists homeless families and helps individuals get back on their feet. Ashby House is Salina’s only full time emergency shelter for women and families and accepts anyone in search of safe housing at any time of the day or night. Ashby House also offers onsite education courses, works with residents to reach personal goals and connects its residents to employment opportunities. In addition to the housing services the emergency shelter provides, Ashby House runs a sober living program to offer care to women addicted to drugs and alcohol and provides a stable living environment during their treatment.  Thank you to Ashby House Executive Director Andy Houltberg, Mayor of Salina Melissa Hodges and President Jessica Martin of Salina Greater Community Foundation for joining me to learn more about this organization’s work to empower those in need of shelter and treatment. Read more about my visit and the Ashby House’s programs here in the Salina Journal. 
  
 
 
Discussing the Importance of Accessible Community College Education 
While I was in Garden City this week, I visited with Garden City Community College (GCCC) President Dr. Ryan Ruda. We talked about the importance of an accessible community college education, and we also discussed Federal Pell Grants’ eligibility extension. I am impressed by the leadership Dr. Ruda provides to GCCC, especially as he has guided the college throughout the uncertainty of this last year, which has been difficult for all higher education institutions. GCCC is dedicated to providing an engaging learning experience for all of its students, and I thank Dr. Ruda for his commitment to GCCC and for speaking with me while I was in town. 
  
Speaking with Sublette Rotary Club 
I spent the afternoon in Sublette on Wednesday to speak with the local Rotary Club and members of the public about the issues important to southwest Kansas. I always find it helpful to hear about what is happening in local communities firsthand and these forums create productive discussion. I also provided an update on federal topics like H.R. 1, H.R. 5, gun control legislation, the filibuster, infrastructure and discussed the importance of veteran community care options.  Thank you to Janie Welsh for the invitation and Bob Moore for the kind introduction. 
  

  
Honoring the Women of the Six-Triple-Eight 
After returning home from WWII, members of the Six-Triple-Eight—the only all-African American, all-female battalion to serve overseas during WWII—went decades without recognition.  These brave women—including Elizabeth Barker Johnson (1920-2020), Indiana Hunt-Martin (1922-2020), Maybelle Rutland Campbell (1921-2021) and Deloris L. Ruddock (1921-2021)—should be awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, legislation I introduced last month. Click here or below to listen to their story. I also encourage you to share this video with your friends and family so more people know their story and we can honor their service. 
  
 
  
Remembering America’s Vietnam Veterans 
On March 29, 1973, the U.S. Military Assistance Command in Vietnam disestablished, marking what is now Vietnam War Veterans Day. Join me in recognizing the service of the nine million men and women, more than six million of whom are living today, who served in active duty during the Vietnam War. I thank them and their families for their service and sacrifice. 
  
 
  
Honored to Serve You in Washington  It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.

12/23/20 19:13,Senator Murphy COVID-19 Weekly Update: December 23rd,"Friend – 
We hope this message finds you well ahead of the holidays. Below please find the Murphy office update on COVID-19. 
As always, if you need assistance, please don’t hesitate to contact our Hartford or Washington, D.C. offices. 
Here’s what you need to know this week: 
	•	On Monday, Congress passed a COVID-19 relief package that includes direct cash payments to qualified individuals, extends the enhanced unemployment benefits, increases SNAP benefits and eligibility, a new round of the Personal Protection Program (PPP) loans, additional funding for schools, and state funding to support vaccine distribution. While Senator Murphy acknowledged the bill does not go far enough and fought for larger cash payments and additional funding for states and cities, this bill will provide critical relief to people in Connecticut who are in desperate need of help. While Congress has done its job to help the American people fight COVID-19 and boost our economy, President Trump threatened to veto this critical legislation and lifeline for millions of Americans in need. We ultimately believe this bill will still become law despite the president’s threats.
	◦	On Tuesday, Senator Murphy and Senator Blumenthal held a press conference in Hartford to tout this critical legislation and acknowledged that more work needs to be done.
	◦	For more information on what is in the bill and how it will impact people in Connecticut, please visit murphy.senate.gov/coronavirus for up to date answers to frequently asked questions.
	•	In addition to COVID-19 relief, Congress also passed a major omnibus funding bill, which includes key funding priorities and legislation Murphy authored to help Connecticut. Specifically, the legislation repeals the mandate to sell Plum Island and includes $18.9 million to clean up the island, provides $700 million for Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor and an additional $1 billion in COVID relief funding to Amtrak, provides $30.4 million in funding for the Long Island Sound Geographic Program, and includes $135.5 million for construction of a new courthouse in Hartford. The bill also includes the Mental Health Parity Compliance Act, legislation Murphy introduced with U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy (R-La.) that will provide federal and state health insurance regulators with additional tools to monitor and assure compliance with mental health parity laws.
	•	At the advice of the attending physician of the U.S. Congress and the continuity of government, Senator Murphy received his first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine this week.
	•	Senator Murphy visited UConn Health to tour their facility and see how their vaccine distribution program operates. During his visit, Murphy thanked health care workers and staff, encouraged people to get vaccinated when the vaccine becomes available to them, and reminded people to continue to get tested for COVID-19 and follow public health guidance.
	•	Senator Murphy congratulated Connecticut Education Commissioner Miguel Cardona on his nomination to become the next U.S. Secretary of Education. His role will be essential in helping our schools operate safely as we navigate out of the pandemic.
	•	Governor Lamont announced that Connecticut has extended its eviction moratorium through February 9, 2021.
	•	PURA has extended the enrollment period for programs to prevent heat source shut-offs for both residential and non-residential customers through at least February 9, 2021. Further, the Winter Protection Program, which protects eligible households during the winter months, is also in effect from November 1, 2020 through May 1, 2021. If you are experiencing difficulty paying your utility bill, you can contact your utility company and ask if you are eligible to be “coded hardship” and enrolled in the Winter Protection Program. If you are ineligible for hardship status or a non-residential customer, ask to enroll in a COVID-19 Payment Plan. Additional information regarding these programs and other assistance can be found here.
	•	As we approach the Christmas holiday, please take a moment to review guidance on how to safely prepare for holiday gatherings. The best thing you can do to protect yourself, friends, and family during the holidays is to only celebrate in-person with members of your immediate household. The best way for us to keep cases down in the state is to stay home and away from others, and celebrate with those outside of our household virtually.
For information on federal coronavirus relief, including help for small businesses, direct cash payments and more, visit murphy.senate.gov/coronavirus. This page provides answers to frequently asked questions and gives a summary of available programs and funding. 
For the latest information about keeping you or your family safe go to cdc.gov/coronavirus. For resources and information about Connecticut’s response visit ct.gov/coronavirus. 
I hope you found this letter helpful. You can get the latest updates on Senator Murphy’s work in the Senate by following him on Facebook and Instagram. If you have questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to our offices in Hartford or in Washington, DC.

Honoring the Life of Congressman-Elect Luke Letlow
 
This week, I joined my colleagues in the Louisiana Delegation during a Special Order on the House Floor in honor of the late Congressman-Elect Luke Letlow. Luke lived an extraordinary life and I was honored to call him a friend. He had a servant’s heart and unwavering dedication to his family, faith, and service to others. Click here or on the image below to view my remarks honoring Luke Letlow.
 

 
 
Follow the Science: Reopen Schools for In-Person Learning Now
 
Louisiana parents and teachers have worked hard to get many students back in the classroom. Unfortunately, thousands of students and parents across the country are still struggling as teachers' unions refuse to reopen schools and Washington Democrats pursue legislation that fails to provide accountability or immediate relief to safely reopen schools for in-person learning.
 
While over $1 trillion remains unspent from previous COVID relief bills, Washington Democrats have rushed to pursue their partisan, wasteful spending package that has no focus on getting children back in school as soon as possible. Less than 10% of this nearly $2 trillion package goes to combatting COVID-19 through public health. Additionally, 95% of the money for schools won’t be spent until after 2021 – slowing down getting kids back in school.
 
The Biden Administration must stop following the teachers’ unions and start following the science. The CDC has made it clear that schools can safely reopen for in-person learning. Dr. Fauci has said the benefits outweigh the risks. Students simply can’t be forced to wait any longer to get back in classrooms. Their mental health and futures depend on it. 
 
Extremism Should be Condemned on Both Sides of the Political Aisle
 
This week, I participated in an Energy and Commerce Subcommittee hearing regarding the spread of disinformation and extremism. Instead of addressing these serious issues, Washington Democrats focused on government censorship and silencing of political views. 
 
I emphasized the danger of disinformation and extremism in the media by highlighting my personal experience from the baseball shooting where the shooter was motivated by prominent politicians and media personalities. Now more than ever, it’s imperative that leaders and media figures from both parties must unequivocally condemn political violence of all kinds.

Dear Friend, 
This month, Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month, our nation and the AAPI community pay tribute to the generations of Asian American and Pacific Islanders who have enriched American history and are instrumental in its ongoing success.   Earlier this week, I joined my colleagues, Representatives Sara Jacobs, Scott Peters, and AAPI community leaders at a press conference urging Acting Secretary of the Navy, Thomas Harker, to name a US Navy ship after US Navy Fireman Second Class Telesforo Trinidad. Trinidad rescued two sailors after a series of explosions on the USS San Diego in 1915 and is a Medal of Honor recipient.    I also joined Rep. Sara Jacobs, who led a letter to the Acting Navy Secretary, requesting him to honor Officer Telesforo Trinidad for serving our nation and risking his life to save the lives of others.    Given the increased violence against the AAPI community, the House worked to pass the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, a bipartisan bill set to combat the rising epidemic of anti-AAPI crimes.    As we close this special month, let us pledge to always stand with our AAPI friends, family, and neighbors and continue fighting to fulfill our founding promise as a nation of immigrants.       Sincerely, 
   JUAN VARGAS   Member of Congress

Dear Friend, 
  
This week, our team reintroduced Eric’s Law with Senator Pat Toomey, a bill named in honor of slain USP Canaan correctional officer Eric Williams which aims to bring justice to crime victims and their families.
  
Reintroducing Eric’s Law 
  

  
In 2013, 34-year old Eric Williams was working as a correctional officer at USP Canaan when he was savagely beaten and stabbed more than 200 times by an inmate who was already serving a life sentence. A jury later found the inmate guilty of Eric’s murder, but because one out of 12 jurors voted against the death penalty, he faced no additional penalty for this heinous crime. Such a miscarriage of justice is intolerable in our legal system.
  
That’s why we’re leading the charge to ensure victims and their families have every opportunity to pursue the justice they deserve. 
  

(Click to watch) 
 
I also had the opportunity to speak on the House Floor to highlight Eric’s Law. Learn more about our legislation here. 
  
Honoring our fallen heroes 
  

  
In honor of National Police Week, I visited the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial to honor our fallen heroes. Service to our nation comes in many forms, but none are more foundational to upholding our laws and protecting our communities than the service of America’s men and women in blue.
  

(Click to watch) 
  
Every officer who puts on the uniform does so at great risk to themselves. They run toward dangerous situations and, by their courage, ensure the protection of those whom they serve. We are grateful for all that you do.
  
Standing by our friend Israel 
  
I co-sponsored a resolution introduced by Congressman Carlos Giménez (FL-26)—officially titled “Condemning the acts of terrorism committed by Hamas against the people of the State of Israel”—that denounces the acts of terrorism committed by Hamas and reaffirms support for Israel, America’s strongest ally in the Middle East.
  
I unequivocally condemn Hamas’ barrage of attacks on Israel—a nation that has long been a key strategic partner and ally of ours in the Middle East. Israel not only has the right, but the duty, to defend its people and sovereignty from these indiscriminate attacks. I will continue to stand by our friend Israel and work to support policies that strengthen its security and combat anti-Semitic behavior around the world.
  
Speaking with Juniata High School students 
  

  
Thank you to Juniata High School and Ms. Renninger for allowing me to speak with students about my work in Congress. I was very impressed with the students’ questions and eagerness to learn about the political process.

VA offering walk-in COVID-19 vaccinations nationwide 
 
All Department of Veterans Affairs facilities and clinics that administer COVID-19 vaccines are accepting walk-ins for eligible Veterans, spouses and caregivers. 
  
“VA encourages those who wish to get their COVID-19 vaccine without an appointment to check the walk-in hours and requirements at their local facility,” said Acting VA Under Secretary for Health Richard Stone, M.D. “ Individuals taking advantage of walk-in vaccinations may need to wait for the vaccine to be prepared and will be screened when entering the facility.” For more information about COVID-19 vaccinations at VA, click here. 
  
Tax Day for individuals extended to May 17: Treasury, IRS extend filing and payment deadline 
  
The Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service announced that the federal income tax filing due date for individuals for the 2020 tax year will be automatically extended from April 15, 2021, to May 17, 2021. 
  
Even with the new deadline, IRS urges taxpayers to consider filing as soon as possible, especially those who are owed refunds. Filing electronically with direct deposit is the quickest way to get refunds. Individual taxpayers do not need to file any forms or call the IRS to qualify for this automatic federal tax filing and payment relief.
  
Targeted advance reevaluation 
  
Those that have been denied for a Targeted EIDL Advance should follow these instructions when requesting a reevaluation:
  
	•	Send email to TargetedAdvanceReevaluation@sba.gov
	•	Use subject line “Reevaluation Request for [insert your 10-digit application number]”
	•	Be sure to include in the body of the email identifying information for the application including application number, business name, business address, business owner name(s), and phone number.
	•	Important: Please also include an explanation and any documentation that addresses the reason for the decline, if available. SBA will contact applicants if additional documentation is required to complete our review.
 
Tax Credits available to small employers to provide paid leave to employees receiving COVID-19 vaccines 
  
The Internal Revenue Service and the Treasury Department have announced further details of tax credits available under the American Rescue Plan to help small businesses, including providing paid leave for employees receiving COVID-19 vaccinations. 
  
The additional details, provided in a fact sheet, spell out some basic facts about the employers eligible for the tax credits. It also provides information on how these employers may claim the credit for leave paid to employees related to COVID-19 vaccinations. 
  
IRS guidance for employers claiming the employee retention credit for first two quarters of 2021 
  
Earlier this month, the IRS issued guidance for employers claiming the Employee Retention Credit under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) modified by the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2020 (Relief Act).
  
General information is in IRS News Release 2021-74, more detailed information is in IRS Notice 2021-23 which explains the changes to the Employee Retention Credit for the first two calendar quarters of 2021, including: 
  
	•	the increase in the maximum credit amount,
	•	the expansion of the category of employers that may be eligible to claim the credit,  modifications to the gross receipts test,
	•	revisions to the definition of qualified wages, and
	•	new restrictions on the ability of eligible employers to request an advance payment of the credit.

Under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, enacted March 11, 2021, the Employee Retention Credit is available to eligible employers for wages paid during the third and fourth quarters of 2021. The Department of the Treasury and the IRS will provide further guidance on the Employee Retention Credit available under the ARPA. 

  
IRS to recalculate taxes on unemployment benefits – refunds to start in May 
  
Already filed and included 2020 unemployment benefits:
  
	•	To help taxpayers, the IRS will take steps to automatically refund money this spring and summer to people who filed their tax return reporting unemployment compensation before the recent changes made by the American Rescue Plan.
	•	Because the change occurred after some people filed their taxes, the IRS will take steps in the spring and summer to make the appropriate change to their return, which may result in a refund. The first refunds are expected to be made in May and will continue into the summer.
	•	For those taxpayers who already have filed and figured their tax based on the full amount of unemployment compensation, the IRS will determine the correct taxable amount of unemployment compensation and tax. Any resulting overpayment of tax will be either refunded or applied to other outstanding taxes owed.
	•	There is no need for taxpayers to file an amended return unless the calculations make the taxpayer newly eligible for additional federal credits and deductions not already included on the original tax return. See attached news release for an example.
  
2020 recovery rebate credit FAQs 
  
The following questions on the RRC have come up recently:
  
	•	I didn’t claim the Recovery Rebate Credit (RRC) on my 2020 return, do I need to amend it?
	•	I made a mistake when calculating the 2020 RRC on my return. How do I fix it? And,
	•	I filed my 2020 return electronically but made a mistake calculating my 2020 RRC. Will my return be rejected?
  
The answers to these questions and more are available on the IRS Recovery Rebate Credit Frequently Asked Questions page.

12/12/20 6:21,Combating Cyber Stalking of Children,"Combating Cyber Stalking of Children
After a two-year fight, criminals who prey on and stalk children may soon face longer jail sentences. Together with Senator Bob Casey (D-Pa.) and Representative Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.-1), I introduced the Combat Online Predators Act in January 2019 to increase criminal penalties for the stalking of children. Just this week, the House approved this legislation, which now heads to the president's desk for his signature after having passed the Senate last October.
Inspired by the story of the Zezzo family of Bucks County whose teenage daughter was cyber-stalked by a friend's father, this legislation enhances federal criminal penalties for stalkers by up to five years if the victim is a minor, and calls for the U.S. Department of Justice to evaluate federal, state, and local efforts to enforce stalking laws and identify enforcement best practices.
No family should have to go through what the Zezzos have. Enacting this bipartisan measure to strongly punish deviants who exploit the Internet to terrorize children is a necessary and commonsense step. I look forward to the president signing it into law.


 
Working to Improve Care for New Mothers
In recent years, physicians and researchers have placed a heightened focus on preventable pregnancy-related deaths in the United States.
Pregnant women on Medicaid are more likely to experience higher rates of severe maternal morbidity and mortality than pregnant women with private health insurance. In an attempt to assist states in reducing these rates, Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and I have introduced the bipartisan Supporting Best Practices for Healthy Moms Act.
This legislation will help improve health outcomes for pregnant women and mothers enrolled in Medicaid by increasing information and resources to better monitor and treat at-risk pregnancies, as well as inform Congress on policies that may assist states in reducing maternal deaths.
As many as two-thirds of deaths resulting from pregnancy or childbirth may be preventable.


 
Good News For Pittsburghers
This week, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) awarded a nearly $10 million grant to the City of Pittsburgh to help protect against landslides on Mount Washington.
Just about every motorist from in and around Pittsburgh has experienced the misery of a Mount Washington road closure. These funds will help to stabilize the hillside and keep traffic flowing between Mount Washington, the South Side, and Duquesne Heights. I was happy to support the City of Pittsburgh's application for this grant and I thank FEMA for approving it.


 
Update on COVID-19
In the past few weeks, Pennsylvania and the rest of the country have experienced a concerning jump in new COVID-19 cases. While the reports of vaccines being available soon are encouraging, the threat of this virus is still very real.
It remains important that people continue to follow CDC recommendations: adhere to social distancing guidelines, wash your hands often, and wear a mask if you are heading out. Remember: my mask protects you and your mask protects me.
According to the Pennsylvania Department of Health, across the state as of Friday, December 4, 2020:
	•	Nearly 20% of all hospital beds were available
	•	Over 15% of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds were available
	•	Over 75% of ventilators were available
As of that date, positive cases in Pennsylvania reached 398,600, roughly a 3% increase from the prior day, and more than 2,893,300 tests had come back negative. This means almost 88% of Pennsylvanians tested for COVID-19, had a result that came back negative.
For more detailed information about resources available to you, visit the COVID-19 resource page on my website.
Further Information:
The Centers for Disease Control provides updates on the virus and safety information for the public and healthcare professionals here.
The Pennsylvania Department of Health provides information on the virus and safety precautions here.
I encourage all Pennsylvanians to take this situation very seriously and observe the recommendations developed by the CDC.

5/21/21 15:26,January 6th,"The latest from Congressman Cicilline
 
Dear Lindsey, 
January 6th was one of our country’s darkest days. The United States Capitol was attacked in an effort to stop the peaceful transfer of power. People died. More than 140 members of law enforcement were injured. Staff, support workers, and Members of Congress endured great trauma. 
On Wednesday, the House passed legislation to establish an independent, bipartisan National Commission to get to the bottom of how this happened and what we can do to ensure it does not happen again. 
I spoke on the House floor during consideration of this bill. Click here to watch my remarks now. 

The Commission passed with significant support from both sides of the aisle. Rest assured, I will continue doing everything I can to hold accountable everyone responsible for this attack on our democracy. 
Combating Anti-Asian Hate
On Tuesday, the House passed the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act: bipartisan legislation to combat the growing and grave crisis of anti-Asian American & Pacific Islander (AAPI) discrimination and bigotry in America.  More than 6,600 incidents of anti-AAPI discrimination and violence have been reported in all 50 states over the last year.   This legislation will: 
	•	Speed up and strengthen our response to hate crimes.
	•	Support state and local governments in establishing online hate crime reporting processes, collecting data and expanding education campaigns, and funding reporting hotlines and initiatives to prevent and respond to hate crimes.
This legislation builds on steps taken by President Biden, including his Day One Executive Order to marshal federal resources to combat racism, xenophobia and bigotry against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and his March 30th announcement of additional steps to combat anti-AAPI hate. Together, these steps will make a significant difference to address hate crimes in America. 
I spoke in support of this bill on the House floor before we voted to send it to President Biden’s desk for his signature. 

Supporting Mental Health Care
Earlier this week, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) awarded more than $11 million in mental health and substance use block grants to the Rhode Island Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities, and Hospitals. 
These block grants will enable Rhode Island to provide comprehensive community mental health services and address needs and gaps in existing treatment services for those with serious mental illnesses. It will also allow Rhode Island to plan, implement, and evaluate activities to prevent, treat, and help more people recover from substance use disorders. This funding was made possible by the American Rescue Plan. 
If you’re searching for treatment for mental or substance use disorders, you can find it by visiting https://findtreatment.samhsa.gov or by calling SAMHSA’s National Helpline, 1-800-662-HELP (4357). 
21st Century Buy America Act
This week, I introduced in the House the 21st Century Buy American Act that will close loopholes that allow federal agencies to avoid Buy American requirements. 
When they’re given the chance to compete on a level playing field, American manufacturers will outperform any of their competitors around the world. The 21st Century Buy American Act will make much-needed improvements to existing laws so that American companies enjoy better opportunities to compete for contracts with the federal government. 
As a longtime hub of manufacturing, Rhode Island would especially benefit from the passage of this commonsense proposal. I look forward to advocating for this bill and other proposals that will help reinvigorate American manufacturing and support job growth. 
Reimbursements for Those Impacted by COVID-19
Thousands of Rhode Islanders have lost a loved one over the past year. For many, this overwhelming sense of grief and loss has been made worse because of the financial stress and burden they’ve taken on in order to lay their loved one to rest. That’s why we fought to ensure that the American Rescue Plan included resources for the families who have sacrificed the most during this pandemic. 
As a result, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is providing resources for Rhode Islanders who have incurred a COVID-19-related funeral expense since January 20, 2020. Eligible Rhode Islanders may apply for a maximum reimbursement of up to $9,000 per funeral. If you or someone you know would like to apply for reimbursement of a funeral expense, click here right now. 
Getting the COVID Vaccine
People are eligible for a COVID-19 vaccination in Rhode Island if they live, work, or go to school in the state. Adolescents ages 12 to 15 can now schedule appointments for the Pfizer vaccine at vaccinateRI.org. For the most up-to-date information about opportunities for vaccination in Rhode Island, visit C19vaccineri.org or call 844-930-1779 or 2-1-1.

2/1/21 20:32,District Update: Fighting for Arkansas Workers,"District Update | February 1, 2021
View Email in Browser 
 
Dear Friends,
In his first days in office, President Biden has already let his promises to American workers fall by the wayside in favor of a far-left wish list. 
The Biden Administration’s decision to terminate the Keystone XL Pipeline will cost the United States thousands of high-paying American jobs and raise energy prices for American families. Similarly, policies like re-entering the Paris Climate Accord provide no accountability for polluters like China and unfairly punishes U.S. manufacturers. These actions undermine U.S. energy independence and place an undue burden on our industries during a period of economic uncertainty.
On Friday, I held a press conference at Welspun’s headquarters in Little Rock with local businesses and workers who have been harmed by President Joe Biden’s Executive Order halting the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. In addition to placing Welspun workers at risk, this decision hurts those selling steel coils, loading and unloading barges on the Arkansas River and on the Port of Little Rock short-line rail, plus many other supplies.  
As your representative in Congress, I am fighting to protect the jobs of hard-working Arkansans. 



HONORING AN AMERICAN HERO
On Tuesday, I was honored to present U.S. Air Force Master Sergeant (Ret.) Robert Davis with two medals for his service during the Vietnam War. 
MSgt. Davis retired in 1975 but never received the proper commendation for his service in Vietnam. MSgt. Davis contacted my office in May of 2020, and on December 29, 2020, the United States Air Force determined that MSgt. Davis was deserving of the Vietnam Service Medal and the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross.
Although it was a nearly 50-year wait, I was proud to recognize MSgt. Davis for his brave service to our country. I'm grateful to my Veterans Team for working diligently over six months to ensure MSgt. Davis received the awards he deserved. 
Read more about the ceremony and MSgt. Davis HERE. 




CLAIMING ECONOMIC IMPACT PAYMENTS FOR DEPENDENTS UNDER 17
The COVID-19 relief bill passed in December 2020 included $600 Economic Impact Payments for dependents under 17 years of age. Friday, January 15th, was the deadline to receive both your EIP and any EIP for each qualifying dependent via direct deposit. Dependents 17 years of age and older do not qualify for EIPs. This includes college students and other adult dependents. 
Please note that it may take several weeks for you to receive payments in the form of a paper check or an EIP pre-paid debit card.  
If you have not received Economic Impact Payments for yourself or your qualifying dependents, you can claim a Recovery Rebate Credit on your 2020 taxes. I encourage Arkansans to file their taxes as soon as possible. As per the IRS, even if you usually don’t file taxes, it is the only way to claim your first or second EIP, as well as EIPs for qualifying dependents. 
For more information on the Economic Impact Payments and the Recovery Rebate Credit, please visit the IRS website HERE. 
If you have questions, please contact me at (501) 324-5941 or Hill.House.Gov. 

ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS
Hearing from Arkansans about the issues important to them is a critical part of my job. Last week, I hosted a conference call to take your questions and discuss your concerns about the issues facing you and your family. 
We discussed the COVID-19 vaccine, policies proposed and enacted by the new administration, election integrity, and other issues important to central Arkansas. 
If you were unable to tune in, watch the full event by clicking HERE or on the image below.


 

GETTING YOUR COVID-19 VACCINE
On Thursday, I met with Col. (Ret.) Robert Ator, who was appointed by Governor Hutchinson to oversee the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine in Arkansas.
The federal government has increased the supply of vaccines available to Arkansans by 16%. More than 400,000 doses have been sent to Arkansas. The increase in doses available and their distribution efficiency will help fill the gaps we have seen across counties.
I am thankful for Col. Ator's leadership and his efforts to implement a consistent and efficient strategy to distribute Arkansas's supply of COVID-19 vaccines.
The following hospitals in central Arkansas are administering the COVID-19 to those in phases 1-A and 1-B:
	•	Baptist Health
	•	UAMS
	•	CHI St. Vincent
	•	Unity Health 
	•	Conway Regional 
Vaccines are also available at local pharmacies. CLICK HERE to find a pharmacy location near you. 



UPHOLDING THE CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE OF CONGRESS
President Biden has begun his term with a slew of executive actions, more than 40 and counting. Governing by executive order is not the right way for the president to begin his first 100 days. Governing by executive action undermines the important constitutional role the Founders granted to Congress and President Biden’s pledge for unity and consensus in Washington. Going forward, I hope that President Biden will instead work with Congress on a bipartisan basis.  My full op-ed in the Log Cabin Democrat. 



CALLING OUT GOVERNMENT OVERREACH 
At the start of the pandemic, hand sanitizer and PPE were in short supply. Seeing a need to help their communities, America’s distilleries stepped up to produce hand sanitizer at little to no profit for frontline workers and families. 
However, in the week between Christmas and the New Year, and after a painful financial year for many of these distilleries, they received a surprise notification that they now owed the FDA more than $14,000 for their willingness to step in and help their fellow Americans.
For their overreach and the poor timing of this announcement, I gave the FDA my Golden Fleece Award. While I am glad the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) overrode the FDA's decision to enforce these fees, this should not have happened in the first place. 
The federal government shouldn’t stand in the way of small businesses that step up to help their communities in times of national crisis. 



HELPING ARKANSAS VETERANS  
On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced the approval of the Central Arkansas Veterans Health Care System as one of only 12 new Fisher House program priority sites to keep veterans and their loved ones together during medical care. Fisher Houses provide short-term, no-cost housing to families and caregivers of hospitalized active-duty or retired military members and veterans who do not live within commuting distance of a hospital.
This funding was long overdue and is welcome news to central Arkansas veterans and their families. Along with my Veterans Team, I have been advocating for a Fisher House in central Arkansas since my first year in Congress. The men and women who serve our country in uniform deserve top-notch medical care with the peace of mind and comfort of having their families close by during their recovery and rehabilitation processes.
Sincerely,
 
Representative French Hill

Your weekly update from Congress

Hello {First Name},

I visited the San Diego border this week to see the crisis at our border firsthand and talk to Border Patrol agents in person about the difficulties they are facing as a result of President Biden’s executive order banning further work on the border wall. In the section of the border I visited, construction on the wall was mere weeks away from completion when President Biden issued his executive order. Now, not only are there gaping holes just across from a major Mexican city, but there are stockpiles of materials going to waste and sections of the fence that badly needs repairs yet can’t be touched. I myself saw several gates through the border fence that stood wide open because our border patrol agents are not permitted to fix the motors connected to them.

Because of the Administration’s reinstatement of the policy “catch and release”, our border patrol agents are being swamped by the influx of migrants who are often dropped off by Mexican drug cartels during Border Patrol shift breaks so that they will be picked up at the beginning of each shift. I saw a large group myself during my visit. The flow of migrants, human trafficking, and drugs across our border is so severe that San Bernardino County is now feeling the impacts of the crisis on our streets despite our distance from the border. According to the San Bernardino County Sheriffs Department, reports of smuggling for labor and sex trafficking within San Bernardino County in the past seven months has exceeded the entire number of incidents reported in 2020. Additionally, Southern California’s drug market is flooded with narcotics coming across the southern border. In the first quarter of 2021 alone, the Inland Regional Narcotic Enforcement Team (IRNET) seized approximately 109 pounds of fentanyl – almost 500,000 pills. Watch my video from the border below to see the problem firsthand and learn more about the situation at California’s border with Mexico.



President Biden's address to Congress

Last week President Biden delivered his first address to Congress, where he proposed plans for a third major spending bill. The American Families Plan would raise taxes to provide free universal preschool and two free years of community college for all Americans. This proposal comes in addition to the President’s $2.3 trillion infrastructure package that only allocates 12 percent of its funding to actual infrastructure and would bring the President’s spending to $6 trillion since his oath of office less than 5 months ago.

If you have not already done so, take my survey below to let me know where you stand on the President's proposals.

My interview with KTLA

It was great to join inside California Politics on KTLA 5 News last weekend. I had the opportunity to discuss infrastructure, government spending, immigration, and more. I pointed out that President Biden’s recent infrastructure budget proposal allocates less than a quarter of its funds to actual infrastructure, and that every single dollar of this package has to be borrowed and will add to our national debt. I believe it s critical that we work on balancing the federal budget and reining in our national debt rather than leaving it as a burden to future generations of Americans.



Honoring our nation's heroes

I was honored to provide Maj. Gen. David Lesperance with a certificate of recognition for his service at Fort Irwin here in California’s 8th District. I wish him the best of luck on his next assignment. I’d also like to congratulate Brig. Gen. Curtis Taylor on taking command of NTC Fort Irwin last week. It’s great to have Brig. Gen. Curtis in the High Desert!



Strengthening our electric grid

I had the opportunity to join the Western Caucus at an energy conference in Tulsa, Oklahoma. We visited several energy sites and learned about how energy diversity can support the sustainability and reliability of energy production. The February Freeze in Texas and California’s rolling blackouts are a grim warning that we must strengthen our energy grid and ensure a diverse national energy portfolio.



In case you missed it: My floor speech opposing President Biden's infrastructure plan

I recently spoke on the House floor to oppose President Biden’s infrastructure package. A major component of our government is to provide long-term investments for the people of our nation that they cannot provide for themselves, such as highways, dams, bridges, and airports. Infrastructure, by definition, is something that we should be willing to invest in. However, it means that we must be very careful in what we define as infrastructure. In Congress, we need to focus on projects that will contribute to true long-term investments for the future of our country.


COVID-19 Vaccination Information



Make sure you have all the information:

I recently received my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. I feel strongly that everyone should have the right to decide for themselves whether to be vaccinated. I believe vaccination is the right choice for me and my family. Vaccinations are no available for anyone above the age of 16 in California.

Merry Christmas!
To say the least, 2020 has been a difficult year for many of us. If there was ever a time to take a deep breath and reflect on not just the challenges this year has brought, but on the blessings we've been given, its now. So lets take a moment to look and remember all the wonderful things we have to be thankful for – health of our family, first responders, health care workers, track drivers, and all essential workers who have worked so hard this past year to keep us all safe.
Mary and I wish you and your family a very blessed and Merry Christmas. Safe travels if you’re on the road, and enjoy this special time with your loved ones.



Congress Passes COVID19 Relief and Government Funding
This past week, Congress passed the omnibus and COVID19 relief package. This massive bill included provisions to fund the federal government, agencies, military, and so forth. Along with a part of the bill containing a section of COVID19 relief.    Here are a few highlights from the omnibus:   - Increase in Pancreatic Cancer Research    - 3% pay raise for all military personnel   - Provides $732 million for rural broadband, including $635 million for USDA's Reconnect broadband program   - Funding for community health centers and state opioid response grants   - Continues the advancement of an all-of-the-above energy approach   - Provides a total of $10.3 billion for VA mental health programs, including $313 million for suicide prevention outreach.   Here are a few highlights from the COVD19 relief bill:   - Individual stimulus check for $600   - Enhanced unemployment benefit of $300 for 11 weeks   - $319 billion for small businesses, including the Paycheck Protection Program    - $25 billion in rental assistance plus an extension of the eviction moratorium    - $7 billion for broadband expansion    - Funding to support COVID19 vaccine distribution    This critical relief is long overdue. I’m pleased Congress is finally moving past partisan bickering & gamesmanship to provide much-needed targeted relief for struggling families, small businesses, schools, and hospitals.
However, it is very frustrating it came just days before Christmas. This relief should have been passed months ago. Instead, Speaker Pelosi refused to budge from her multi-trillion dollar wish list.
In the end, this package will help people who are desperate for it. I’m pleased it includes direct payments for families – even if the amount is lower than the bipartisan bill Congresswoman Lisa Blunt Rochester and I proposed. The fact this direct payments was included is in large part thanks to the pressure we were able to apply.
Just know our work is not finished. I will continue to advocate for immediate relief for American families.

This week, I signed a letter to save the Hyde Amendment and protect the ban on taxpayer-funded abortions. Taxpayers should never be forced to use their hard-earned money to fund abortions. Learn more, here.



It's an honor to receive an A+ rating from the Susan B. Anthony List, one of the most distinguished pro-life organizations in the country. I will always back pro-life policies, vote to defund Planned Parenthood, and stand with the millions of Americans who fight every day for all unborn children.



Throughout my time in Congress, I have been working hard to promote pro-life policies. Below are a few of the many pro-life initiatives I have supported in this new Congress.



Wednesday was International Holocaust Remembrance Day. It is important we remember and honor the lives of the six million Jews and millions of other victims who perished at the hands of the evil Nazi regime. We must never forget the horrors that took place, and continue to pay tribute to the survivors who share their stories.



Thank you to Tipton County Mayor Jeff Huffman for giving me an update on labor and economic development in Tipton County. I look forward to continuing our conversations about how we can best use the Megasite for future job growth in West Tennessee.



I enjoyed meeting with Covington Mayor Justin Hanson on Thursday to discuss how we can work together to grow Covington’s economy and come out from COVID-19 stronger. Thank you for taking time to sit-down with me.

12/19/20 8:51,Vaccines Save Lives,"December 19, 2020 
Dear Fellow Marylander: 
This week, media headlines brought incredible news that vaccines for COVID-19 have been approved and are ready for distribution. In fact, the first Americans, mostly frontline health care workers, received the first dose of a two-part vaccine. We have reached this point in record time through the collaboration of dedicated scientists and federal investments in research and supplies. My immense thanks go out to all those who worked around the clock on the development of these vaccines, especially those in the Bethesda-based National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
Getting vaccinated is a key piece in our fight against this deadly COVID-19 virus that has infected more than 17 million Americans and tragically cost the lives of more than 311,000 Americans. The numbers will continue to rise until we can get the community spread under control. 
I have said it before, but cannot say this enough: wearing a mask, maintaining six feet of space from people not in your household, and frequent hand washing are critical public health tools. If more Americans had followed these simple recommendations, we may have saved hundreds of thousands of lives. But we have to deal with where we are today and these newly approved vaccines will play a critical role in preventing further spread in our communities.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), “a vaccine stimulates your immune system to produce antibodies, exactly like it would if you were exposed to the disease. After getting vaccinated, you develop immunity to that disease, without having to get the disease first.""
Without a vaccine, our children’s schools may not be able to safely reopen; businesses, and especially restaurants and event venues, would continue to hemorrhage customers and money; our hospital systems would continue to be overwhelmed with patients as more individuals are infected with COVID-19. A vaccine helps Americans achieve herd immunity by protecting people from a virus, rather than exposing them to it. With herd immunity, the vast majority of the population are vaccinated, lowering the amount of virus spread in the whole population. 
Vaccines help us reach a higher level of immunity by preventing diseases from taking root. 
Two versions of a COVID-19 vaccine have been approved for the current emergency use. One is by Pfizer and one by drugmaker Moderna. Others are also nearing the approval stage. While pharmaceutical companies are working to increase available supplies, at present there are not enough doses of the vaccines to provide to every person in this country or around the world. It has been a mammoth undertaking. 
To that end, most of the first wave of vaccines will be prioritized for frontline health care workers and nursing home residents and staff, for which this pandemic has been most deadly. In addition to seniors, essential workers and those with underlying health conditions and at high risk for complications from COVID-19 could be next in line and then the distribution will move to the general public.
I would strongly encourage everyone to talk with their doctor to gauge their risk and then get vaccinated as soon as a dose is available to you. Like wearing a facemask, getting a vaccine is something we do to keep ourselves safe. But – more importantly – it is something we do to keep safe those we love as well as those in our community we don’t know but may be at high risk. We all need to look out for each other. Only as a community can we fight back against this deadly virus.
I plan to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it is available to me. While I am healthy, like everyone in my age group, I need to be careful. I maximize the use of technology to keep up virtual visits with Marylanders across the state throughout this year, but my job inherently requires me to trek through the Capitol on a near-daily basis. Without fail, I wind up standing a bit closer than I would like with other senators, staff, security and media, many of whom have traveled from all 50 states to be there for our collective work. Certainly, there are smaller crowds than usual these last few months during the pandemic, but there are enough interactions that I cannot ask everyone who stops to ask me a question in the hallways, or even on the floor of the Senate, when they last washed their hands or if their face mask is on correctly. Like you, the last thing that I would want to do is unknowingly bring home the virus to my family.
Last week, I led a meeting of the Maryland delegation with Maryland Acting Health Secretary Dennis Schrader and Acting Deputy Secretary of Public Health Dr. Jinlene Chan. The pair outlined steps MDH has taken to prepare Maryland for the first round of vaccine distribution. All of us on the video call urged them to move as quickly as possible and to focus on communities disproportionately impacted by COVID-19, as well as geography. We cannot allow those hardest hit by the virus to fall through the cracks at this critical moment of relief.
Yesterday, Vice President Pence publicly received his coronavirus vaccine, as did House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer. President-elect Biden plans to receive his vaccine publicly next week, and former Presidents Obama, Bush, and Clinton have committed to publicly receiving the vaccine. I trust the scientists who approved these vaccines, and so do our national leaders. This is not a miracle-cure that will end the pandemic, but it is one of the most critical tools in our arsenal to get our society back to normal. If you have questions about the vaccine, please review public health resources like the MDH guide to the vaccine here: https://covidlink.maryland.gov/content/vaccine/. 
Lastly, having a vaccine is not the end of this public health crisis. The number of individuals vaccinated will start small and continue to grow. It may be March or April until lower risk individuals have a chance to get vaccinated. The vaccines have proven safe, but more time and additional studies must take place for us to better understand the long-term health protections afforded by the vaccine. We also do not know if the vaccines prevent vaccinated people from spreading the virus – this means, even after someone is vaccinated, they must still be vigilant with their mask use and other public health measures.  
I urge you to please be cautious this holiday season so that you and those you love are healthy enough to celebrate next year.
Thank you for your efforts and stay safe.

Dear Lindsey,
 
I wanted to update you on my work in Washington, DC, and across New York's 19th congressional district.
 
January was a trying month filled with the struggle of fighting COVID-19 and the pain of an attack on our US Capitol. However, there were moments that gave me hope -- like getting to thank National Guard service members from New York who bravely protected the Capitol building or seeing communities work together to help vaccinate residents.
  
  

  
Left: Thanking NY National Guard in DC Right: Touring Ulster County's Primary Vaccination Site at Kingston High School
  

I will keep working to deliver critical federal relief to our local governments to help administer vaccinations and continue essential services. Our local governments are our EMS, fire departments, law enforcement officers, teachers, and sanitation workers -- Congress must ensure that they remain employed and are able to continue serving residents. 
 
This month, I announced the reopening of programs like the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) funding. You can learn more below about who is eligible and how to apply. 
 
Last week, my office launched our Valentines for Veterans and Vaccinators program to show love and support for those who put themselves in harm’s way to protect others. Please mail a Valentine to my office, 256 Clinton Ave, Kingston, NY, c/o Valentines for Vets and Vaccinators to lift the spirits of selfless community members.
 
This Wednesday, February 3rd at 6:00 PM, I'll be hosting a town hall to hear directly from you. Do you have a question? Click here to submit your question. 
  
 
LEGISLATIVE UPDATE
 

In January, I had two veterans bills signed into law and reintroduced three bills to the House to help our rural communities. 
 
Bills Signed into Law
	1.	Fairness for Local Veteran Cemeteries Act 
	2.	Improving Benefits for Underserved Veterans Act
 
Reintroduced Bills
	1.	Direct Support for Communities Act
	◦	This legislation would deliver federal COVID-19 relief funding directly to counties, towns, and villages.
	2.	Protecting Rural Access to Care Act
	◦	This legislation would protect 3 Critical Access Hospitals in NY-19 that are at risk of closing due to administrative rule changes.
	3.	 Rebuild Rural America Act 
	◦	This legislation would ensure that our rural counties, towns, and villages can access direct and flexible federal assistance to tackle economic development projects tailored to their specific needs.
  
 
CONSTITUENT SERVICES UPDATE
 

Our casework team has been working around the clock to assist you and get answers from federal agencies. 
 
In Janurary, the Small Business Administration announced additional PPP funding. To find out if you’re eligible to apply for an initial PPP loan, click here. For a copy of the initial PPP loan application, click here. To find out if you’re eligible for a second PPP loan, please click here.

NY-19 MEETINGS
 
In January, I met with folks across NY-19. From Montgomery to Ulster to Dutchess to Delaware, local leaders, small business owners, and frontline workers made clear that our community needs direct assistance from Congress. I’ll keep working to secure those critical dollars.

1/30/21 9:46,Senator Rick Scott's Week in Review,"This week, Senator Rick Scott outlined a number of his priorities for the 117th Congress, which include re-filing several of his bills to reform Washington, protect Floridians and their businesses against the threat of Communist China, and hold dangerous dictators in Latin America who threaten the security of Florida and the United States accountable.
Senator Rick Scott said, “Two years ago, I began my service in the U.S. Senate determined to make Washington work better for Florida families. We’ve made some great progress, but as we all look forward to the 117th Congress, I want to make one thing very clear – I am absolutely focused on fighting for Florida and getting things done that actually help families and businesses succeed and live their dreams in our great nation. Surely, this won’t be easy. In the short time that I’ve served so far in the U.S. Senate I’ve learned that too much of the focus in Washington is on politics, not people. It’s time for that to change.   ""I’m starting the 117th Congress strong by proposing real solutions to reform Washington, protect our environment and national security, and hold dictators in Communist China, Venezuela and around the globe accountable. I truly hope that the Biden Administration and my Democratic colleagues will join me in these efforts. I look forward to continuing my work on behalf of all Floridians and getting real results that make our state and nation stronger, more successful, and more accountable to the people.""

Sen. Rick Scott: We Must Enhance Border Security and Provide Permanent DACA Protection 
Senator Rick Scott announced his intent to file a bill to provide funding and resources needed to secure America’s Southern border, and offer a permanent solution for individuals registered in and eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Senator Scott’s action follows repeated announcements and actions by the Biden Administration to advance radical immigration policy rooted in open borders and amnesty, pause deportations of illegal immigrants, and completely ignore border security.  Senator Rick Scott said, “One of the most moving experiences of my life has been watching new American citizens say the pledge of allegiance at their nationalization ceremony. I’ve always said that getting immigration reform done becomes a lot easier once our border is secure and we have a permanent solution for DACA. Today, I am proud to announce that I am filing a bill that provides a permanent solution to the many people in the DACA program and provides tens of billions of dollars in long-term funding for our Southern border wall and border security personnel. My proposal will give our law enforcement and border patrol the resources they need to do their job, protect American families and stem the tide of the rampant and unyielding illegal immigration we’ve seen for decades at the Southern border. President Biden’s plan of open borders and amnesty isn’t about practical reforms – it’s a radical and dangerous subversion of law and order. We can and must do better.   “American innovation and our unique culture has been built on legal immigration. But, for too long, politicians in Washington have refused to address the issue of illegal immigration head-on, and we can’t ignore it anymore. Doing so is reckless and unfair to the American people, kills American jobs, and prevents countless families from pursuing the opportunity to chase their American Dream. It’s time to come together and finally bring a sensible solution forward."" Read more HERE.

Senador Rick Scott: Debemos mejorar la seguridad en nuestra frontera y brindar protección permanente para DACA 
El Senador Rick Scott anunció su intención de presentar un proyecto de ley que proporcionaría fondos y recursos necesarios para asegurar la frontera sur de los Estados Unidos y ofrecer una solución permanente para las personas registradas y elegibles para el programa de Acción Diferida para los Llegados en la Infancia (DACA). La acción del Senador Scott se da luego de varios anuncios y acciones de la Administración Biden para promover una política migratoria radical basada en fronteras abiertas y amnistía, detener las deportaciones de inmigrantes ilegales e ignorar por completo la seguridad en la frontera.  El Senador Rick Scott dijo: “Una de las experiencias más conmovedoras de mi vida ha sido ver a nuevos ciudadanos americanos decir el juramento en su ceremonia de nacionalización. Siempre he dicho que lograr una reforma migratoria es más fácil una vez que nuestra frontera esté segura y tengamos una solución permanente para DACA. Me enorgullece anunciar hoy que estoy presentando un proyecto de ley que brindará una solución permanente a las personas en el programa DACA y proporcionará decenas de miles de millones de dólares en fondos a largo plazo para un muro en la frontera sur y oficiales de seguridad fronteriza. Mi propuesta le dará a nuestra policía y patrulla fronteriza los recursos que necesitan para hacer su trabajo, proteger a las familias estadounidenses y detener la marea de inmigración ilegal desenfrenada que hemos visto durante décadas en la frontera sur. El plan del Presidente Biden de fronteras abiertas y amnistía no se trata de reformas prácticas, es una propuesta radical y peligrosa para la ley y el orden. Podemos y debemos hacer algo mejor.   ""La innovación americana y nuestra cultura única se han construido sobre la inmigración legal. Pero por mucho tiempo, los políticos en Washington se han negado a abordar el tema de la inmigración ilegal de frente, y no podemos ignorarlo más. Hacerlo sería imprudente e injusto para el pueblo americano, eliminaría trabajos e impediría que innumerables familias tengan la oportunidad de perseguir su Sueño Americano. Es hora de unirnos y finalmente presentar una solución sensata”. Lea más AQUÍ.

Sen. Rick Scott: “Buy American” Puts American Interests First 
In 2020, the U.S. Senate passed Senator Rick Scott’s bipartisan “Buy American” resolution calling on all Americans to support American jobs and manufacturing and build our supply chain by purchasing American-made products, from any American manufacturer. This week, Senator Rick Scott offered his support of President Joe Biden’s “Buy American” executive order, which directs agencies to strengthen requirements for procuring goods and services from sources that will support U.S. businesses and workers.
Senator Rick Scott said, “Last year, the Senate passed my bipartisan resolution calling on families to buy American-made products whenever possible to help support American jobs and manufacturing, and build our supply chain. Now more than ever, Americans must remember that every time we buy a product ‘Made in China,’ we are putting another dollar into the pockets of Communist Chinese government leaders and their cronies who steal our jobs and our technology. It’s not always easy to buy American, but it’s an important step we can all take at home to ensure America remains a leader in the global economy and is self-reliant in our supply chain. Buying American is not partisan, and I’m glad to see President Biden join me in acting to put American interests first. I hope the Biden Administration’s foreign policy nominees will share this commitment to holding Communist China accountable and take aggressive action to confront the threat it poses to international security and American interests."" Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott to Brazilian President Bolsonaro: Don’t Let Communist China into Brazil’s Networks 
Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro urging the him to reconsider Brazil’s decision to open the country’s 5G network auctions to Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei Technologies, which the U.S. Government has determined to be a national security threat and continues to be a bad actor across the globe. Companies that allow Huawei into their networks risk their national security and give Communist China direct access to the most sensitive data of their citizens, including medical records, financial information, and social media accounts.

Senator Rick Scott Joins Senator Ted Cruz and Colleagues to Introduce Constitutional Amendment Imposing Congressional Term Limits 
Senator Rick Scott joined Senator Ted Cruz and colleagues to reintroduce an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would impose term limits on Members of Congress. U.S. Senators would be limited to two six-year terms and members of the House of Representatives to three two year terms.  Senator Rick Scott said, “Washington is more dysfunctional than ever, and I’m fighting every day to make reforms in the best interest of American families. Career politicians are never going to make the tough choices needed to get our nation on a successful path. They care more about politics and their next election than the future of this country. That has to end now. We need to reimagine government and term limits are the right place to start.” Read more from Senator Cruz’s office HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott: Congress Must Get Serious About America’s Debt 
Senator Rick Scott wrote a letter to his colleagues in Congress urging them to commit to making the changes necessary to put the nation on successful fiscal path and address our out-of-control $27 trillion federal debt. In August, the current two-year suspension of the debt ceiling will expire and Congress will again be faced with a vote to increase the debt limit. Read more, including the full letter, HERE.

Senators Rick Scott, Rubio, Schatz and Hirono Introduce Restoring Resilient Reefs Act 
Senator Rick Scott joined Senators Marco Rubio, Brian Schatz and Mazie Hirono to reintroduce the bipartisan Restoring Resilient Reefs Act, which would reauthorize and modernize the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000 and strengthen NOAA’s Coral Reef program.      Senator Rick Scott said, “During my time as Governor of Florida, we worked to increase investments in our environment by $1 billion to preserve and protect our natural resources. I’m proud to join Senators Rubio, Hirono and Schatz to reintroduce the Restoring Resilient Reefs Act, which will build on our efforts and help restore and protect our coral reef ecosystems. I will continue working to make sure future generations can enjoy all that Florida has to offer."" Read more from Senator Rubio’s office HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott to DHS: We Need Answers on Biden’s Radical Immigration Order 
Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary David Pekoske requesting additional information on President Biden’s radical immigration plan of open borders and amnesty, including his push for a 100-day pause on deportations and gravely concerning order for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to release individuals awaiting deportation. Senator Scott has long called for reforms to fix the broken immigration system and believes we must take swift action to address this critical issue, including providing real, long-term solutions for TPS and DACA, but that must start with securing the border. Read more, including the full letter, HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott, Colleagues Reintroduce Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act 
Senator Rick Scott joined Senator Lindsey Graham and colleagues in reintroducing the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would provide protections for unborn children at 20 weeks after fertilization.  
Senator Rick Scott said, “In the United States, we believe in the sanctity of life and the value that each child brings into this world. Although not yet born, these babies are capable of feeling pain, and we must work to protect their lives just the same. I hope all my colleagues join me in protecting life and pass this legislation quickly.” Read more from Senator Graham’s office HERE.

Senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio Reintroduce Bill to Address Harmful Algal Blooms in South Florida 
Senator Rick Scott joined Senator Marco Rubio and Congressmen Brian Mast and Darren Soto to reintroduce the South Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act, legislation that would direct the Interagency Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms to assess the causes and consequences of the blooms in Lake Okeechobee and around Florida’s southern coastlines identify needed resources, and develop a plan of action to address these challenges.    Senator Rick Scott said, “As Governor and now as Senator, I’ve worked with leaders across our state to address the harmful algal blooms that plague Florida’s waters. Today, I’m proud to join Senator Rubio to build on these efforts by reintroducing the South Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act to expand research and our understanding of blue-green algae and red tide. We must keep working to protect Florida’s beautiful waters, environment and natural resources for future generations."" Read more from Senator Rubio’s office HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott: Biden Needs to End Democrat Hostility Toward Israel and Stand up for our Great Ally 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following the announcement that the Biden Administration will restore diplomatic relations with the Palestinian Authority, including a resumption of American aid to the Palestinians.   Senator Rick Scott said, “The Trump Administration made tremendous efforts to facilitate peace and prosperity between our great ally Israel and Arab nations. Two weeks in, and the Biden Administration wants to undo this progress and appease illegitimate Palestinian leaders – demonstrating once again the Democrats’ reckless disregard for the security and prosperity of Israel. The Palestinian leadership, which has been operating as a dictatorship for 15 years, had their last election for president in 2005. They still do not accept Israel’s existence and support terrorism. Israel is a vibrant democracy that supports capitalism, champions human rights and holds free and open elections. The Biden Administration can’t go down this path. The United States must always align with those fighting for freedom and democracy, and stand up against those that do not respect human rights."" Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott Reintroduces American Security Drone Act 
Senator Rick Scott reintroduced the bipartisan American Security Drone Act for the 117th Congress. Senator Scott’s American Security Drone Act works to prohibit the U.S. Government from purchasing drones manufactured in countries identified as national security threats, like Iran and Communist China. The American Security Drone Act, which was passed out of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee last Congress, is cosponsored by Senators Chris Murphy, Marco Rubio, Richard Blumenthal, Marsha Blackburn, Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley.  
Senator Rick Scott said, “I’m proud to join my colleagues to reintroduce my American Security Drone Act, which will help protect our national security and the privacy of American citizens by prohibiting the federal government from buying drones manufactured by our adversaries. I’ve been very clear about the threat we face from technology companies controlled by Communist China, which is known for espionage and theft of technology. For too long, the United States has used taxpayer dollars to buy drones from companies backed by the Communist Chinese Government, allowing one of the United States’ biggest adversaries into the most sensitive areas of our government and putting our national security at risk. There’s absolutely no reason we should allow this to continue. We must pass the American Security Drone Act immediately.” Read more HERE

Senators Rick Scott, Ron Johnson and Marco Rubio Introduce the Luke and Alex School Safety Act 
Senator Rick Scott joined Senators Ron Johnson and Marco Rubio to reintroduce the Luke and Alex School Safety Act. This legislation would codify into law the Federal Clearinghouse on School Safety, which informs parents and educators on expert recommendations and best practices that schools can implement to improve school security. The clearinghouse also provides information on available federal resources and grant programs that can be used toward these safety measures.
Senator Rick Scott said, “Nearly three year ago, we lost 17 innocent lives in the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. I think about those lives lost, and the families impacted, every day. Since that horrible day, I’ve worked closely with many of the victims’ family members as Governor and now as Senator to ensure no child, educator, or family has to experience that again. This legislation, the Luke and Alex School Safety Act, honors two of the victims, Luke Hoyer and Alex Schachter, and builds on our work to keep schools safe and prevent another tragedy. I will never stop working to protect our students and educators, and ensure they have a safe environment to learn and succeed."" Read more from Senator Johnson’s office HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott: HHS Must Provide More Transparency on Vaccine Distribution Plan 
Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to Health and Human Services Acting Secretary Norris Cochran requesting detailed information about the Biden Administration’s plan to administer 1.5 million shots a day in the coming weeks and give 150 million vaccinations over the next 100 days. Senator Scott is also requesting HHS quickly provide more certainty to local elected officials and communities regarding vaccine distribution so they can communicate expectations to the overwhelming amount of constituents eager to receive a vaccine. Read more, including the full letter, HERE. 

Sen. Rick Scott in the Wall Street Journal: Biden’s COVID Spending Plan is Filled with Wasteful, Liberal Priorities 
Senator Rick Scott wrote a letter to the editor of the Wall Street Journal in response to a recent editorial, “Biden’s First Spending Blowout” on President Biden’s massive $1.9 trillion COVID spending package, which includes wasteful and unnecessary spending provisions, like billions to bailout liberal states.     In the letter, Senator Rick Scott wrote, “…I agree that more must be done to support those whose livelihoods have been ripped apart due to the pandemic, but President Biden’s proposal goes far beyond that. His plan is filled with progressive pipe dreams and wasteful spending. We ought to be working on solutions that provide targeted relief and deal directly with the horrific economic and health impact of Covid-19. Unfortunately, his plan is more focused on using the pandemic to push harmful liberal priorities.…""   Read the full letter to the editor in the Wall Street Journal HERE.

Dear Lindsey,
 
This pandemic has really strained working parents and their children, who, over the past year, have faced increasing childcare, education and food security challenges. It hasn’t been easy, and we recognized that more needed to be done for families amid our fight against COVID-19. 
 
The American Rescue Plan will help childcare providers in our Commonwealth keep their doors open and reduce costs for struggling families, while expanding the Child Tax Credit to help parents provide for their kids and combat the child poverty problem made worse by this pandemic.

Dear Friends,
Last week I had the opportunity to tour vaccine clinics in the Second District and receive updates from hospital leaders on how health care providers have been responding to COVID-19. I have been conducting congressional oversight of vaccine distribution and Operation Warp Speed in my role as Republican Leader of the Energy and Commerce Committee’s Health Subcommittee this Congress and Republican Leader of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee last Congress. It was incredible to see vaccine distribution come to fruition at the local level. I have been a strong supporter of empowering local communities to make distribution decisions with funding support from the federal government. I have voted for five COVID-19 bills, which total about $4 trillion in COVID-19 relief and include vaccine distribution resources. Additionally, the federal government reserved and paid for all the COVID-19 vaccines. I enjoyed learning about vaccine distribution efforts at the local clinics in Glasgow, Owensboro, and Bowling Green. In Kentucky, more than 1.6 million people have been vaccinated. This shows what we can accomplish when we work together.  Glasgow  My first vaccine clinic tour last week was at T.J. Samson Community Hospital in Glasgow. I learned that no COVID-19 vaccine dose has gone to waste at the time of my visit. The media also joined the tour to see the process of administering vaccines at this clinic.

Rep. Guthrie being interviewed at a vaccine clinic in Glasgow

In Congress and at the local level, I’ve been hearing about vaccine hesitancy. I have been vaccinated for COVID-19, and I encourage others to get vaccinated as well to protect themselves, their families, and their community. In Glasgow, I shared why people should not let politics stop them from getting vaccinated. Vaccine work has been done under both a Republican and a Democrat administration, and both presidents have been vaccinated for COVID-19. Former President Donald Trump launched Operation Warp Speed and laid the groundwork for vaccine distribution, and President Joe Biden’s administration has continued this work of distributing vaccines to Americans.
Owensboro 
My next stop was Owensboro Health. I met with hospital leaders and heard how the CARES Act, a COVID-19 relief bill I supported, has been helping with some of the COVID-19 costs. Hospitals and health care heroes have been put under a tremendous amount of stress due to COVID-19. Hospital leaders shared how telehealth services have been expanding. I recently led a hearing on the future of telehealth in the Energy and Commerce Committee. Patients have been utilizing this technology to receive health care, while also protecting themselves and others from potential COVID-19 exposure. I will work to help ensure telehealth is here to stay past the COVID-19 public health emergency.

Rep. Guthrie speaking to the media at Owensboro Health

At this vaccine clinic stop, I shared how COVID-19 vaccines approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are effective in protecting against the COVID-19 variants and preventing serious cases and hospitalizations. Thankfully, about 80% of people 65 years old and older have had one at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Older adults are at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. However, all ages eligible for COVID-19 vaccines should also get vaccinated to protect against COVID-19.
Med Center Health
My last vaccine tour was in Bowling Green at Med Center Health. I reiterated that I’ve been following vaccine development and Operation Warp Speed closely. I know from this oversight work that vaccines are safe and effective. COVID-19 vaccines approved by the FDA have been developed in record speed without cutting any safety corners. In order to receive approval, COVID-19 vaccines have to go through a rigorous review process. 

Rep. Guthrie touring the vaccine clinic at Med Center Health

The FDA reviews all the COVID-19 vaccine data to ensure the vaccine is safe and meets the efficacy requirements. An independent panel of scientists, which is separate from the FDA and the vaccine developer, makes a recommendation on if the COVID-19 vaccine should receive authorization from the FDA. For all the approved COVID-19 vaccines, the FDA and an independent panel of scientists have verified that the vaccine is safe and effective.

Please note that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have recommended a pause of Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccinations due to six cases of rare blood clots reported in people who have received this vaccine. Please contact your health care provider if you are experiencing a severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, and/or shortness of breath within three weeks of being vaccinated with Johnson and Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine. This is being examined to see if there’s a link between the vaccine and rare blood clots. I am following this closely and will keep you informed.

2/1/21 10:14,Wicker Leads Pro-Life Push in Senate,"Wicker Leads Pro-Life Push in Senate 
Americans Oppose Taxpayer Funding of Abortion 
On January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court issued a grim decision that haunts our nation to this day. In Roe v. Wade, justices threw out state laws protecting the unborn and declared abortion legal in all 50 states. This decision undercut the legislative process and the will of the American people, paving the way for injustice on a massive scale. In the years since Roe v. Wade, an estimated 62 million unborn lives have been taken. 
Pro-life Americans have not been silent amid this tragedy. Every year, scores of citizens gather in state capitals and in Washington to send a defiant but powerful message in defense of life. This year’s March for Life, which was held virtually, came at the outset of a new presidential administration that has already proved hostile to the rights of the unborn. The Biden Administration’s abortion agenda makes it all the more vital for pro-life Americans to continue speaking out. 
Tax Dollars Should Never Subsidize Abortion 
President Biden has promised to unify the country, but his recent actions on abortion reveal extreme priorities. In one of his first steps as President, Mr. Biden reversed the Mexico City policy, which had blocked taxpayer dollars from funding nonprofit groups that advocate for abortion overseas. This decision showed disregard for the consciences of millions of pro-life taxpayers who are offended by efforts to fund abortion with their tax dollars. 
The President’s decision is clearly out of step with an increasing number of Americans. Last year, a Marist poll revealed six out of 10 Americans oppose tax dollars going toward abortion. Many of these individuals identify as pro-choice, but they agree that fellow citizens who are pro-life should not have to bankroll something they find morally abhorrent. Congress has long echoed this reasonable view. For more than 40 consecutive years, lawmakers have passed the Hyde Amendment in annual spending legislation to prevent taxpayer dollars from funding abortion. 
I have called on Congress repeatedly over the years to make the Hyde Amendment permanent. I am doing so once again by introducing my No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion bill, which would ban the use of tax dollars for abortion once and for all. I am also supporting legislation to outlaw abortion of unborn babies who are capable of feeling pain. Beyond that, I am pushing hard for legislation to protect vulnerable infants who survive an abortion attempt. There is no excuse for any lawmaker to oppose such a reasonable and humane protection. 
Public Opinion Is Shifting Toward Life 
When Roe v. Wade was handed down in 1973, many Americans did not know the full extent of fetal development. But new technology has revealed stunning details inside the womb. Parents are now able to see vivid sonogram images of their pre-born children. Many grandparents, like my wife Gayle and me, have seen the feet, heartbeat, and faces of our young grandchildren waiting to enter the world. More Americans are awakening to the reality that each new life, born and unborn, is precious and worthy of protection. 
Twenty-five years ago, 56 percent of Americans identified as pro-choice and 33 percent identified as pro-life. Today, that gap has closed completely, with roughly half of Americans identifying as pro-life. Even more telling is that 81 percent of Americans oppose late-term abortion, and 65 percent oppose abortion in the second trimester. It is clear that Americans want expanded protections for the unborn. I will continue leading the fight in Congress to protect the most vulnerable members of the human family.

Hello Friend,
 
As we enter the final stretch of what has been an unexpectedly challenging and stressful year, my hope is that you are able to find space for peace and joy as we pause to reflect and turn the calendar to a new year. 
 
Like many of you, I usually look forward to end of year celebrations to reconnect with our friends, neighbors and loved ones. From necessity, our plans must be different this year, so that we can keep one another safe. 
 
While the rollout of new vaccines provides a light at the end of the tunnel, we must remain vigilant as, for now, COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths continue to rise. Let's keep our collective guard up and consider the ways we can minimize the risk to our families, friends, and communities. 
 
Medical experts tell us that the safest course is to limit in-person celebrations to members of your immediate household and to connect with others by phone, mail, internet, or other virtual options. If you must travel or interact with people outside your immediate household, please check out these considerations to slow the spread of COVID-19 offered by the CDC: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/daily-life-coping/holidays.html 
 
As hard as it has been to deal with all the challenges created by this pandemic, I have been both awestruck and grateful for the innovation and energy of the local heroes among us who have stepped up to help those in need. If you know someone who is making a difference during this pandemic, please nominate them here so that we can recognize them: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfxRVWhEeXsDvW382r84GbHV8dIzzJsBMCSNnodh4WwOtUkzA/viewform  
 
My staff and I are committed to doing all that we can to meet your needs during this challenging time. If you need help with a federal agency, please call 610–626–2020. You will be connected, via phone, to a constituent services representative who can assist you.
 
Please make sure to subscribe to our newsletter, follow me on Facebook and Twitter, and visit our website for updates. I look forward to seeing you in 2021!
 
Happy holidays and take care,
 
Mary Gay

2,289 doses of COVID-19 vaccine were administered in the Marianas this week, bringing the total to 17,816. That’s 693 shots on Rota, 510 on Tinian, and 16,613 on Saipan. Presently, our Man Amko’ (age 55+), homebound healthcare patients, individuals working in high risk health care and first responder settings, and workers critical to the Marianas infrastructure across the public and private sector are eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine on all islands. Please visit VaccinateCNMI.com to determine when you are eligible and for the most up-to-date information on the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the Marianas. 
 

More vaccine on the way

The Marianas will receive 9,360 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in the first week of March. This is a 20 percent increase over February’s allocation and will bring the total doses of the Pfizer vaccine for the Marianas to 30,810. Each individual needs two doses, 21 days apart, for maximum effectiveness. The Marianas will also receive 4,600 doses of the Moderna vaccine, 43 percent more than February’s allocation for a total of 12,800 doses. Two injections are also required for Moderna to be effective. Vaccine distribution data for both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines is publicly available on CDC’s website. 
 
 

American Rescue Plan moves ahead. The Budget Committee released its compiled version of the American Rescue Plan last week and Manager’s amendments to the 591 page bill on Thursday. The House is slated to vote on the relief bill Friday night, as we go to press. Behind the scenes work continues to refine the legislative language (see following story), but we have put together some of the major funding provisions in this chart to keep you informed. The Senate is expected to consider the bill next week, under budget reconciliation rules requiring a simple majority vote for passage. 
 
 

$1,000+ Child Tax Credit increase

One change I negotiated in the Manager’s amendment to the American Rescue Plan is money for the Marianas to pay the increased Child Tax Credit monthly, rather than once a year. The CTC is also going up from $2,000 per child through age 16 to $3,000 per child through age 17. And parents of children six-years-old and under will receive up to $3,600 for each child. In last week’s version of the Rescue Plan payments were to become monthly—everywhere except in the insular areas. I got that fixed in the Manager’s amendment, so parents in the Marianas will also be eligible for advance monthly payments. I also added the $300,000 the Commonwealth told us would be needed to cover the cost of cutting the $250 or $300 checks monthly. The Governor would still have the option to stick with an annual payment, however, if he does not want responsibility for making monthly payments. Child support payments like this have shown to boost academic achievement and improve children’s health and well-being. Long-term studies point to increased lifespans and higher incomes for those helped by these cash transfers. I urge parents to use the money wisely to help their children. 
 
 

Hopwood classroom visit. On Wednesday, I went to Hopwood Middle School to visit Dr. Riya Nathrani’s 7th Grade Computer Literacy Class. Since the pandemic began, I have not been able to make my regular visits to schools nor talk to students face-to-face as much as before. Working for students is my top priority in Congress. So, I hope to get more opportunities to meet these important constituents in the weeks ahead, as our schools reopen. 
 
 

How to recover lost learning hours. Public School System officials described the challenges facing our students, educators, staff and administrative officials during this pandemic, when we met on Tuesday. Though I was able to secure much-needed funding to make sure PSS has the financial resources needed to get through this crisis, there is still much work to do to recover lost learning hours and ensure our students prosper. 
 
 

Congressional Award Info Sessions. I encourage young people between the ages of 13 ½ and 24 to take part in the Congressional Award program. The Congressional Award is the highest award that Congress bestows on young people. It is not a competition, but rather something every individual can earn by meeting goals in personal development, physical fitness, public service, and exploration. Your congressional office will be hosting two virtual info sessions for new and current Marianas participants. You can RSVP for the February 25 session for current participants here. To RSVP for the March 4 session for new participants, please click here. 
 

Furloughed workers now PUA eligible

Marianas workers who had their hours reduced or were furloughed, while their place of employment stayed open, will now be able to collect Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation. The Biden administration issued new guidance yesterday, reversing a Trump administration decision to cut off CNMI government employees and some private sector workers from the federal unemployment aid. I wrote the new President, along with Guam Delegate Michael F.Q. San Nicolas and 11 other Democratic colleagues, the day after Biden’s inauguration, asking for a review of the harmful Trump policy. The “Marianas (kk) expansion,” as the Congressional Research Service is referring to this new interpretation of Section 2102(a)(3)(A)(ii)(I)(kk) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, allows any individual, who previously filed a PUA/FPUC claim and was denied for any week, to be given the opportunity to self-certify eligibility under the updated eligibility criteria and receive unemployment aid retroactively. 
 
 

18,685 unemployment claims pending

18,685 Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation applications are still waiting to be processed by the Commonwealth as of February 13, according to the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL). These latest numbers are an increase from the 18,608 applications that were reported pending as of December 12. USDOL tells the congressional office that as many as 18,002 applications, however, may be fraudulent.
 
 

Guerrero previews Chamber plans. Mr. Joe Guerrero, the newly elected President of the Saipan Chamber of Commerce, came by the congressional office Tuesday; and we discussed the Chamber’s plans for the coming year. I look forward to working with Mr. Guerrero in his new capacity and with all the Chamber members to find solutions to the issues faced by our business community. 
 
 

CPA voices minimum wage concern. On Friday, I met with Commonwealth Ports Authority officials regarding proposals in Congress to raise the minimum wage nationwide over 4 years to $15/hour. CPA is not alone in concern about managing the increase from the current $7.25/hour. I successfully added an 18-month hold-off just for the Marianas, when the Education and Labor Committee marked up the American Rescue Plan with the wage hike. And in the past, I have been able to use other legislative means to stretch out wage increases in the Marianas legislatively, avoiding harm to business and job loss, while keeping wages fair to workers. As we go to press, the fate of a minimum wage increase in the Rescue Plan is uncertain. 
 

$2.5m for conservation, recreation

The Commonwealth’s Division of Fish and Wildlife is receiving $2,512,312 in Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration program grants, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced Thursday. DFW is receiving $1,380,868 in sport fish restoration funds for fishery projects, boating access, and aquatic education, and an additional $1,131,444 in wildlife restoration funds for supporting projects to restore, conserve, manage, and enhance wild birds and mammals and their habitat. The funds are made available from revenues generated by the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration and Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration acts. When anglers, hunters, and boaters purchase equipment and fuel, the manufacturers and importers of those goods pay into the Wildlife Restoration, Sport Fish Restoration and Boating trust funds. These funds are then distributed to support wildlife agencies across the country. Funding increased substantially this year due to increases in fishing equipment, motorboat fuel, and firearm revenues. 
 
 

President George W. Bush signs the proclamation creating the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument in 2009, as Governor Benigno R. Fitial stands by. The required management plan has just been released for public comment.

Monument plan finally available

The long awaited draft management plan for the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument was released Wednesday—10 years overdue—and now the public comment period begins. President George W. Bush created the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument on January 6, 2009. His Presidential Proclamation 8335 included a two-year deadline for the Interior and Commerce secretaries to prepare the management plan and write regulations to provide for scientific exploration and research, public education and outreach, and sustainable fisheries in the Monument. The draft plan was prepared by the two federal departments in cooperation with the Commonwealth government. The plan defines agency management roles and responsibilities and lays out the goals, objectives, and proposed management activities for the next 15 years. The plan also includes an environmental assessment to evaluate the potential impacts of implementing the proposed management actions. Public comments will be accepted through May 25, 2021. For more information and to submit comments, go to the Federal Register notice. 
 

$139k for vulnerable wildlife

The Commonwealth’s Division of Fish and Wildlife, Department of Lands and Natural Resources, is also receiving $138,770 from the State Wildlife Grant Program, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced Friday. The funds will be used to help address a variety of conservation needs identified in the Marianas Wildlife Action Plan including research, fish and wildlife surveys, species restoration, habitat management, and monitoring. The State Wildlife Grants are specifically targeted at accelerating the recovery of threatened and endangered species and preventing other species from having to be listed under the Endangered Species Act. Funds are allocated by formula based on population size and geographic area. Congratulations to DFW. 
 

$428.5k for historic preservation

The Commonwealth’s Historic Preservation Office of the Department of Community and Cultural Affairs is receiving $428,531, the National Park Service announced Wednesday. The grant will be used to support a variety of historic preservation and community projects focused on heritage preservation. The money will also provide technical assistance to private and public interests that seek to preserve and protect historic resources in the Marianas. Appropriated by Congress, Historic Preservation Fund grants are administered by the Park Service and awarded annually to states and territories for the identification and protection of historic properties and supporting activities. Established in 1977, funding for the Historic Preservation Fund is provided by Outer Continental Shelf oil lease revenues. Congratulations to HPO. 
 

Naturalization test info session

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is hosting a webinar on the naturalization civics test on Wednesday, March 3, 2021 from 3:30 pm to 4:30 pm ET/ Thursday, 6:30 am to 7:30 am ChST.  Experts will provide an overview of the two versions of the test, the online test preparation materials, and other resources. The test is part of the process to become a naturalized citizen. The two versions are from 2008 and 2020. Both are oral tests. The 2008 civics test will be given to applicants who filed the Form N-400 on or before November 30, 2020.  Applicants who filed on or after December 1, 2020 and before March 1, 2021 will have the option to take the 2008 or 2020 exam. To register and for more information, go to the USCIS website. For study materials for both tests, click here. 
 
 

Meeting with the Korean Cultural Center. Recently I met with members of the Korean Cultural Center. Mr. Kim Hong Kyun, Kim Sung Hun, and Jun Lee presented an Appreciation Plaque for the work we have done together. Keeping in touch with local associations and understanding their needs, challenges, and plans for the future helps me be a better advocate for the Marianas in Congress. Thank you to the Korean Cultural Center for this kind gesture. 
 

$739,500 for Prior Service

The Interior Department announced funding of $739,500 for the Prior Service Trust Fund Program last Friday. The Fund benefits approximately 700 former employees of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. The Federal government assumed responsibility for these retirees, when the Trust Territory ended in 1986. The former TT employees live today in the Marianas, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau.

House passes H.R. 560: Permanent status for long-term workers, investors 

The U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 560. My legislation grants permanent status in the Marianas to foreign investors, originally admitted under Commonwealth immigration law. The same status would be available to a small group of CW workers.

Puerto Rico crisis a chance to improve Medicaid, EITC

A hearing that brought Treasury Department officials to the Hill last Thursday to help develop a legislative response to Puerto Rico’s fiscal crisis was also an opportunity for me to promote reforms in how insular areas are treated under Medicaid and expansion of the earned income tax credit. Read my statement here.

Dear Friend: 
Here is my weekly video update. 
Great news! The CDC now says that people who have been vaccinated do not need to wear masks in outdoor or indoor settings. Please continue to follow local and private company policies that ask people to still wear masks in certain businesses. And you will still need to wear your mask on in most transportation and medical settings. 
Illinois, including Chicago, has entered the Bridge Phase, as the state prepares to remove all restrictions. 
But more people still need to get vaccinated. So please get the vaccine as soon as possible, if you haven't already. And if you have children 12-15yo, they are now eligible for the Pfizer vaccine. 
Are you following me on social media? Use the links above to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. I look forward to hearing from you.Sincerely, 
  
COVID-19 VACCINES
All Illinoisans Age 12 and above are eligible for a vaccine now. Get more details about how to find your nearest vaccination site and other details on my vaccine page.

Dear Friends,
By now, many of you have heard and read of the tragic and disturbing attack that took place at the U.S. Capitol last Wednesday. You have viewed the horrifying video and photographic images. I am deeply saddened and outraged by the actions of those involved in this uncivil and devastating act.  I condemn the rioters’ destruction, mayhem, and malice towards the peaceful conduct of the business of democracy in the People’s House. We are a nation of law and order, and it was disgraceful that the safety and security of citizens and the historic structure that houses the first branch of government were needlessly put at risk.  Make no mistake that the Founding Fathers foresaw an event like this that occurred on Wednesday. They anticipated the unrest that follows when the legislative branch holds too much power in determining who serves as the president and vice president of our country.  The dissemination of the misleading perception, by the president and others, that Congress somehow could overturn an election was reckless. This view does not align with the U.S. Constitution. The framers of the Constitution carefully debated and designed our system whereby the president would be elected under rules determined by the individual states and with electors selected in the states. This diffusion of power in separating Washington from the selection of the president was set to prevent the boiling over of passion and heat that we watched unfold on January 6th. Faithful to the U.S. Constitution, which I took an oath to uphold, I voted to uphold the results of the Electoral College, which were certified by the individual states on December 14, 2020. Please see my statement from the morning of January 6th HERE.  I have listened carefully to central Arkansans and their concerns about election security, and I can assure you that election integrity is one of my top priorities for the 117th Congress. I support the idea of a federal commission to review the November 2020 election, assess procedures and any irregularities, and make recommendations to the states for any needed reform. As I have said on CNBC, Fox Business, and local television, we must have faith in our government; we must have faith in our election results. Elections are the cornerstone of our democracy, and if we wish to preserve our democracy, we must ensure that all our citizens have confidence in our electoral process.  For generations, the United States of America has witnessed a peaceful transition of power on Inauguration Day; it’s a hallmark of our society and our nation and a day that sets us apart from oppressive and unstable nation-states. As we move toward the executive transition at noon on January 20th, I am preparing my work with the new 117th Congress and the incoming administration to expand opportunity for all of our families, bolster our national security, and provide American leadership on the global stage. These goals reflect the values of the hardworking women and men of central Arkansans who sent me to Washington – this is especially important as we work to rapidly distribute the vaccines, defeat the menacing coronavirus, and restore our economy and prosperity. Thank you for the many expressions of support and concern that I received from folks across Arkansas and the nation. Please keep our country in your prayers. 

COVID-19 VACCINE UPDATE

As vaccines continue to be distributed across Arkansas, learning how and when can you get your COVID-19 vaccine is critical to defeating this virus. 
Governor Asa Hutchinson has laid out a detailed plan, which can be found HERE.
Please adhere to these key updates to the vaccination process:
VACCINATION FACTSHEET
As of January 5th, the vaccine is available to 73 of the 75 Arkansas counties. 
When can I get the vaccine?
-        Phase 1-A: High-priority healthcare workers, first responders, long-term care workers, and residents.  There are an estimated 180,000 Arkansans in this category, and the goal is to complete this phase by the end of January.
-        Phase 1-B:  Arkansans 70 years of age and older, frontline essential workers (for example, school staff, postal workers, grocery store workers, childcare workers, etc.).  There are an estimated 400,000 Arkansans in this category. The goal is to start and complete this phase in February.
-        Phase 1-C:  Arkansans between 65-69 and between 16 and 64 years of age with high-risk medical conditions, as well as additional essential workers.  The goal is to start this phase in April.
Where can I get vaccinated?
-        Phase 1-A.  Vaccinations for healthcare workers and first responders are currently available at select hospitals and community pharmacies. Others in this phase should contact community pharmacies available HERE.  Call your local pre-approved pharmacies to schedule the first dose; the second dose can be scheduled once the first dose is complete.
-        Phases 1-B and 1-C. Vaccines will be distributed at community pharmacies and certain hospitals. These phases will require a private-public partnership with state agencies.
-        The Arkansas Department of Emergency Management (ADEM) and Arkansas National Guard, along with other partners, will release a logistical plan for vaccinations on or by January 15, which will be made public and available on ADH’s website.
Can I choose which vaccine I receive?
-        At this time, you’re unable to choose which vaccine you receive, but both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccinations have been found to be safe and effective.
How much does the vaccine cost?
-        Through Operation Warp Speed, the cost of the vaccine is covered in full by the government, but there is an administration cost. 
-        However, CMS is acting to cover the administration cost in full and at no cost to you.

DISCUSSING COVID RELIEF WITH ARKANSAS CPAs

Last week, I had the opportunity to meet with Certified Personal Accountants (CPAs) in Arkansas to discuss the most recent COVID-19 relief bill.  

I appreciate the time that this group dedicated to sharpening their knowledge on the updated loan processes of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), Economic Impact Disaster Loans (EIDL), and the newly created rental assistance program.

These programs will serve to provide much-needed aid to Arkansas families, small businesses and their employees, and the hard-working men and women of Arkansas. 

Providing long-lasting and impactful support to Arkansans is a top priority as we move into the 117th Congress. 



ATTENDING THE ICBA THINKTECH ACCELERATOR KICK-OFF EVENT  Last week, I was able to able to kickoff, via video, the 3rd Annual ICBA ThinkTECH Accelerator. It is an honor to have innovators and leaders such as The Venture Center, global financial services technology, and FIS in the second district.
The Think TECH Accelerator allows community banks to help propose fintech solutions and come together with ideas to take the future of banking forward through innovation.
I am especially excited for the exceptional 10 companies that have chosen Little Rock as their home and working hub for the next 12 weeks. With a revitalized and growing downtown area, access to tech talent, low cost of living, our superb outdoor recreation areas, Little Rock is fast becoming a technology hub.   



LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY


It is critical to note the importance of building and investing in positive community models. The work that organizations do to contribute to improving the quality of life in the central Arkansas region is important and doesn’t go unnoticed. One of the key players in building and keeping a positive community is law enforcement. 

Each day, I am reminded of the sacrifices the men and women of our law enforcement agencies make to keep us safe.

Last Saturday was National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, and I took that time to reflect on the dedication of those officers who commit to keeping our friends, families, and communities safe.

I had the opportunity to speak with Brian Osmundson at the Little Rock Police Department to let him and his fellow officers know just how much I appreciate their service to central Arkansas. 

The tireless effort that these men and women put into their work deserves our utmost respect, and I would urge you to show appreciation to these hard-working individuals whenever you are given the opportunity. 


 


PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROTECTION PROGRAM LOANS EXTENDED

Thanks to the recent COVID-19 relief bill, which passed Congress with my support, $284 billion in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans will be reopened and available to struggling small businesses across the country this week. 

The PPP program has been extended until March 31, 2021, and creates a process for small businesses or non-profits to can receive a “Second Draw PPP Loan” of up to $2 million if the entity (i) has fewer than 300 employees and (ii) can demonstrate a reduction in gross receipts of 25% when compared to a corresponding financial quarter of 2019; (iii) creating a simplified PPP loan forgiveness application for loans under $150,000. Small businesses that never previously received a PPP loan can also apply.

The Small Business Administration and the Treasury Department announced last Friday that Paycheck Protection Program loans would be available to First Draw PPP loan applications starting today, January 11, and second draw PPP loan applications on January 13 from participating CFIs, which include Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), Certified Development Companies (CDCs), and Microloan Intermediaries.

The program will be open to all participating lenders shortly thereafter. 
For more information on the Paycheck Protection Program and other resources for small businesses, visit the SBA website HERE. 



OPEN HEALTH INSURANCE ENROLLMENT

Last week, the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service sent an estimated 8 million Economic Impact Payments (EIPs) in the form of prepaid debit cards.

If you did not receive an EIP as a direct deposit, make sure to check your mail carefully for a check or a prepaid card.

These prepaid cards are contained in envelopes that display the U.S. Department of the Treasury seal. The EIP card will have the Visa name on the front of the card and the issuing bank name, MetaBank, N.A., on the back of the card. 

More information about receiving EIPs in the form of debit cards and checks can be found HERE. 

Sincerely,

Representative French Hill

Honoring Our Heroes
 
Dear Friend,
 
I have the honor of interacting with U.S. Capitol Police officers every day I’m in Washington. They are hardworking, professional, and dedicated to their duty protecting the Capitol, its employees, and all who visit.
 
On Wednesday, I paid my respects to Officer Brian Sicknick—who lost his life from injuries sustained in the line of duty on January 6th—as his remains were lying in honor in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda.
 
My prayers continue to be with his loved ones and the family members of all of our brave law enforcement officers as we mourn this tragic loss.
 
 

 
 
Legislative Business
 
 
The calls for unity and bipartisanship originally promoted by the Biden Administration have been abandoned already. Utilizing an arcane budget procedure, Washington Democrats have decided to ignore House and Senate Republicans — and the millions of Americans they represent — to ram through a partisan COVID relief bill that will cost nearly $2 trillion.
 
That’s why I voted against Democrats' proposed shell budget last week. Instead of focusing on targeted, effective, and bipartisan relief measures – or ensuring the $1 trillion in unspent funds left over from previous relief packages are effectively utilized – they are maneuvering to muscle through a liberal wish list under the guise of a pandemic proposal.
 
This isn’t the first time. Democrats have consistently sought to use COVID-19 as ""an opportunity"" to pass their extreme policies into law. They have fully admitted the tactic in recent years, and the philosophy has continued into the 117th Congress. 
 
They know Republicans won’t be supportive of a wide range of left-wing policies— including enacting a $15 minimum wage that will hurt small businesses and destroy well over one million jobs, bailouts for states like New York and California, whose budget troubles pre-date the coronavirus pandemic, and paying people more to stay on unemployment than to go back to work. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have decided to use budget reconciliation to fast-track their radical agenda – not provide assistance to real Americans who need real help.
 
Democrats are eager to dodge the 60-vote threshold in the Senate and avoid any bipartisan consensus. They know many of their measures are controversial and unrelated to the problem at hand, and therefore, unlikely to garner 60 votes to be passed by regular order. Reconciliation is meant to deal with budgetary policies – it’s not supposed to be weaponized to pass controversial initiatives unrelated to revenues and spending.
 
Last week’s vote was the first step in the Pelosi-Schumer led strategy to implement President Biden’s far-left agenda through reconciliation. House Democrats would rather masquerade their liberal policy priorities as coronavirus relief than work alongside Republicans.
 
We should be focused on creating jobs, distributing vaccines, growing the economy, and reopening schools. Yet in reality, what this package will do is kill jobs and further balloon the national debt, while overlooking the over $1 trillion in unspent relief money available from previous congressional action.
 
Notable examples of remaining funds include:
	•	SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program: $280 billion;
	•	Health Spending: $239 billion;
	•	Economic Injury Disaster Loans: $172 billion;
	•	Unemployment Insurance Expansion: $172 billion;
	•	Education Funding: $59 billion;
	•	State and Local Aid: $58 billion;
	•	Stimulus Checks: $52 billion;
	•	Child Care and Development Block Grant: $10 billion; and
	•	Agriculture: $29 billion.
 
Even a top economic advisor to former President Obama said that the Biden proposal is too big. It’s not targeted, transparent, or collaborative. President Biden and the majority have made it seem like the only way forward is a partisan bill through reconciliation. That is completely false. I urge renewed efforts to reach across the aisle and negotiate in good faith. We should be serving the American people – not our own political objectives.
 
 
 
Committee Action
 
 
On the committee front, I am pleased to announce that I was selected last Wednesday to serve on the Subcommittees on Select Revenue Measures, Trade, and Oversight for the House Ways and Means Committee, the chief tax-writing committee in the U.S House of Representatives.
 
My focus has always been on creating jobs, building communities, and eliminating government barriers. As our nation enters a new era, I look forward to providing an even greater voice for advancing bold solutions to some of the most pressing issues of today.
 
Through my experience in the medical field, as a mayor, and a businessman for over 30 years, I am eager to continue to partner with Ranking Member Kevin Brady to be an effective advocate for the Third District and the state of Georgia.
 
With the goal of increasing opportunity for individuals and families, growing our economy, and harnessing American competitiveness and innovation, I’m ready to roll up my sleeves and get to work.
 
 

 
 
Look Who's Coming to Town
 
 
Last week, KB Autosys announced that it is investing $38 million to open its first advanced manufacturing facility in the United States. Located in Meriwether County, this development will create 180 new jobs as Georgia remains a national leader for advanced manufacturing facilities.

January Jobs Report
 
 
On Friday, the U.S. Department of Labor released its January jobs report. The sluggish report fell flat, adding less than half the jobs economists were expecting. With Biden signing an executive order to stop the Keystone XL pipeline in his first days in office, he immediately killed thousands of jobs.
 
At a time we should be focused on safely reopening the economy, this action devastated an entire industry. Read more about the January jobs report here.
 
 
 
Building Career Opportunities
 
 
Workers across our nation need access to work-based training to compete on the world stage. That is why I was proud to reintroduce the PARTNERS Act alongside Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici (OR-01), Congresswoman Haley Stevens (MI-11), and Congressman Brett Guthrie (KY-02) to support apprenticeships and work-based learning programs that provide workers with pathways to better paying jobs and opportunities.
 
 
 
What's on Drew's Docket?
 
 
This week, I will be speaking with Emory President Gregory Fenves, participating in a House Ways and Means Committee hearings, and speaking with constituents about matters that are most important to them.
 
As always, I’m here to serve you. Please contact my office with any questions, comments, or concerns. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to keep track of upcoming legislation and events!
 
 
Sincerely,

Kansas Common Sense  January 25, 2021
Hello,  Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them. 
  
Meeting with Kansans Regarding COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution   
Visiting a Vaccination Clinic  This week, I received a briefing from The University of Kansas Health System and toured their vaccination clinic to see how they have readied their facility in order to best serve patients and medical staff. I heard more from hospital personnel about how I can aid Kansas at the federal level in its vaccination rollout and make certain vaccine dissemination to the general public is done in a more effective manner. Currently, Kansas ranks 36th in population and ranks 36th in number of Pfizer vaccines received. Kansas also has approximately 0.874% of the U.S. population and has received 0.838% of the vaccines. As Kansas moves forward with vaccinations, we discussed the need for better communication between federal, state and local entities, as well as greater transparency surrounding the amount of doses hospitals and counties will receive each week.   I was impressed with the way The University of Kansas Heath System continues adapt to the evolving logistics involved in ordering, receiving and preparing the COVID-19 vaccine for Kansans. Thank you to The University of Kansas Health System President & CEO Bob Page, Director of the Center for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Dr. Tim Williamson, KU School of Medicine Interim Executive Vice Chancellor Dr. Steve Stites, Government and Community Affairs Vice President Kenny Wilk, Chief Operating and Nursing Officer Tammy Peterman and Assistant Chief Nursing Officer Kim Dixon for your hard work to vaccinate Kansans. 
  
 
  
Discussing Vaccine Distribution with Ellis County Leaders  I met with leaders from Ellis County in Hays this week to discuss vaccine rollout and the next steps as COVID-19 vaccines continue to be more widely administered across the state. While Ellis County leaders told me of their decision to move vaccinations to a single location in order to most effectively administer the vaccine, they also informed me of the challenges they face as a rural community receiving the vaccine.   Thank you to Ellis County Commissioner Neal Younger, Ellis County Health Service Director Jason Kennedy, First Care Clinic CEO Brian Brady, Ellis County Emergency Manager Darin Myers, HaysMed President Eddie Herrman and First Care Clinic Medical Director Dr. Christina Fisher for your feedback and time. 
  
Attending the 59th Presidential Inauguration 
On Wednesday, January 20, I attended the 59th inauguration ceremony for President Joseph R. Biden to witness this important moment in our nation’s democracy. The inauguration represents the orderly and peaceful transfer of power that is an enduring symbol of a government of the people, by the people and for the people. I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues in this new Congress to create a better future for all Americans. 
  
 
  
Thanking the Kansas National Guard 
The Kansas National Guardsmen honorably served their country these past weeks by defending our nation’s capital during the peaceful transition of power. They, and all members of the guard, deserve our deepest respect and gratitude. The decision to remove them from the U.S. Capitol last week without providing the appropriate accommodations was disgraceful and unacceptable.  While I was glad to learn that these dedicated Guardsmen were allowed back inside the Senate Office Buildings and the Capitol Complex, their removal should not have happened at all. I visited with members of the Kansas National Guard who were stationed near the Library of Congress to hear about their experience on Capitol grounds. I will work to make certain our National Guardsmen are treated respectfully during the remainder of their time in Washington, D.C. 
  
 
  
Urging President Biden to Prioritize America’s Veterans 
As chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I urged President Biden to work with Congress on behalf of our nation’s veterans. The VA committee has made significant accomplishments for veterans over the last several years, such as allowing veterans in rural states like Kansas greater choice to seek health care where and when it is convenient for them and landmark veterans health care legislation, but there are still many challenges ahead. The VA is in the midst of the greatest transformational change since the end of World War II, and the faithful execution of the laws recently passed by Congress on behalf of veterans is what will ultimately improve the lives of veterans in Kansas and all across the country.    Caring for our nation’s veterans has always been a unifying force during my time in Congress. I expressed to President Biden that it is my hope it will continue to be so under his presidency.  To read my full letter, click here. 
  
Protecting American Jobs and Energy Independence through the Keystone XL Pipeline 
This week, I joined seven of my Senate colleagues in introducing legislation to authorize the continued construction of the Keystone XL pipeline following President Biden’s decision to revoke the cross-border operation permit. This project is expected to provide approximately 11,000 direct high-paying jobs and create up to 60,000 indirect and direct jobs, generating tax revenue, increasing renewable-energy demand, reducing emissions and strengthening North American energy independence. Construction of Keystone XL began last year, jump-started by a $1.1 billion investment. Major segments of the pipeline have already been built, including one that crosses the U.S.-Canadian border.  Canceling the Keystone XL Pipeline will cost our country thousands of jobs, raising energy prices and forcing us to become more dependent on foreign countries to supply our nation’s energy needs. At a time when our economy and communities are hurting due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we should be focusing on sending people back to work rather than taking jobs away. Despite passing every environmental impact assessment more than five years ago, Keystone XL has been politicized for almost 12 years. Discontinuing construction now is reckless for the hardworking American families relying on the jobs and lower energy costs it will provide them in the future. 
  
Calling for Senate Consideration of the Flawed Paris Climate Agreement 
Earlier this week, I sponsored a Senate resolution calling on President Biden to submit the Paris Climate Agreement to the U.S. Senate for advice and consent as required by the Constitution before joining a treaty. In 2016, President Obama entered the Paris Agreement without the consent of the Senate, going directly against the U.S. Constitution. Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution states that the President may only enter into an international treaty provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur.  I opposed the Obama Administration’s decision to enter into the Paris climate accord without appropriate congressional input, and again, when the Trump Administration pulled out of the accords, I reiterated that Congress must have a role in consenting to such agreements. I urge President Biden, before he rushes our country back into the flawed Paris Agreement, to submit it to the Senate for consideration in order to avoid making a consequential decision that lacks input from Congress. 
  
Thanking Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy 
This week, I thanked Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy for his service to this nation and all that he has achieved for our national defense and servicemembers throughout his tenure as Secretary of the Army. His leadership has benefitted the soldiers, Army civilians and veterans across the country who call the Army their family. He has seen our Army through unprecedented challenges, and I know our soldiers are stronger for it.  One of my most memorable experiences in the Senate was visiting 1st Infantry Division soldiers in Germany and Poland (pictured below), followed by our trip to Afghanistan to meet with troops on the front lines of the Global War on Terror. These meetings were the beginning of a productive working relationship that formed into a strong friendship. Since then, I have appreciated his guidance and support during his visits to Kansas and our many discussions in Washington, D.C. He was able to join me in Kansas in 2019 to visit Seitz Elementary School at Fort Riley where he was instrumental in finding the funding for this school during his time as Special Assistant to Defense Secretary Robert Gates in 2011. The Big Red One soldiers and their families have benefitted from his service. A fitting culmination to his service was the opportunity to lay wreaths together at Arlington National Cemetery, a solemn occasion that I will never forget. 
  
 
  
Remembering Roe v. Wade 
For the first time since Roe v. Wade was announced in 1973, Washington D.C. will not host its annual March for Life. This event typically brings hundreds of thousands to our nation’s capital, including hundreds from Kansas, to march peacefully in protest of a decision that has enabled the elimination of more than 60 million children. Abortion rates have declined in recent years, and we must continue building on this success rather than rolling back legal protections for the unborn and their mothers, taxpayers and health care providers of conscience. I thank all who work to make their voices heard to protect the right to life for the most vulnerable of Americans. 
  
Honored to Serve You in Washington  It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.

2/27/21 15:25,PPP Updates & More,"Dear friend,

It has been another busy week in Washington as we continue to work to pass the American Rescue Plan which will return our students safely to the classroom, get vaccines out to the people, put dollars in families’ pockets and put people back to work. 

On Tuesday, I reintroduced four bills to ensure that future Presidents of the United States cannot perpetrate some of the same corrupt acts that President Donald Trump committed. The bills would require candidates, campaigns, and companies to report foreign interference in U.S. elections; enhance protections for whistleblowers who come forward to expose official wrongdoing; and make it a criminal offense for the President, Vice President, or their families to enrich themselves from foreign sources. You can read more about them here.  


 

The House also passed the Equality Act 224-206 this week. No one should be discriminated against for who they love or how they identify. I was proud to vote yes on this critical legislation and look forward to it’s swift passage in the Senate. 
 

Today, I reintroduced the No Guns for Abusers Act to protect victims of domestic violence. The pandemic has brought on stay-at-home orders nationwide, increasing the risk of intimate partner violence. Never has it been more important to take action to prevent guns from remaining in the hands of domestic abusers. 

Finally, I wanted to make sure you were aware of the changes made to the Paycheck Protection Program and how they might affect you. For two weeks, there will be a PPP exclusivity period for businesses with fewer than 20 employees. This means lenders will prioritize the PPP loan applications of businesses and nonprofits with fewer than 20 employees, and sole proprietors. Because there is a limited amount of funding available, businesses should apply as soon as possible.

The Biden Administration also announced several other changes to the program, including:
	•	Revising the PPP loan calculation formula for sole proprietors, independent contractors, and self-employed individuals and establishing a $1 billion set-aside for these businesses located in low- and moderate-income areas;
	•	Supporting formerly incarcerated entrepreneurs by making most individuals with felony convictions eligible for PPP;
	•	Making individuals with federal student loan delinquencies or defaults within the last seven years eligible for PPP; 
	•	Directing SBA to issue clear guidance that otherwise eligible PPP applicants cannot be denied access because they use Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers to pay their taxes.

For more information on the two-week prioritization period, check out the FAQs below or call my office at (510) 370-3322. 

My company already received a PPP loan. Can it get another one?

The SBA is allowing some first-time recipients to get a second PPP loan, but not everyone. To be eligible for a “second-draw” PPP loan a business can’t have more than 300 employees. To qualify for the second round of forgivable loans from the SBA, businesses must have spent or plan to spend all of their first loan and show they had a 25% or more drop in revenue in 2020 compared to 2019. (This calculation does not include loan forgiveness).

How much funding am I eligible for?

If your company is receiving a PPP loan for the first time, you can receive up to $10 million. Second-draw loans are capped at $2 million. In both cases the amount of funding you receive is based on your payroll for the previous year.

What kinds of expenses can a PPP loan cover under the new rules?
While the program was initially limited to payroll expenses, the new PPP funding can also be spent on a range of new expenses including operations expenditures, property damage costs, supplier costs, and worker protection expenditures. (For more on what PPP loans can cover, check out page 48 of this document). 

When does the 14-day exclusion period end? 
The exclusivity period will run from February 24 to March 10, 2021. If you are eligible, make sure to work with a local PPP lender on filling and submitting a loan application soon.

How do I apply? 
The Small Business Administration’s website has more information on finding a lender near you and identifying which loan you are eligible for.  

Please feel free to contact my office for assistance. You can reach me on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram. My DM’s are open!  

Enjoy your weekend and stay safe.

                                             District Update 

Dear Friend,

Last week we told you about the House majority’s effort to pack the Supreme Court. This week, they are looking to “pack” the U.S. Senate – by unconstitutionally adding the District of Columbia as the nation’s 51st State.

Like the “court packing” proposal we told you about last week, Speaker Pelosi’s “Senate packing” scheme is another partisan power play – this one driven by a desire to add two new U.S. Senators.  Not only is this a bad idea, it runs afoul of the Constitution, which would have to be amended to allow D.C.’s admission as a state. I strongly opposed this unconstitutional power grab in the last Congress and voted against it this week, too.

Democrats also passed two bills this week that would further degrade America’s ability to protect its borders – even as we face a worsening illegal immigration catastrophe. One of those bills would significantly hamper our ability to restrict incoming foreigners for national security or public health reasons, and the other would make it more difficult for officers at ports-of-entry to screen and search potentially dangerous foreigners attempting to enter our country – including those who have been flagged for advanced screening due to suspicious activity or prior criminal offenses. I voted against both of these bills, which would take us in exactly the wrong direction at the worst possible time.

We also saw a California lawmaker travel to Minneapolis this week – just over the bridge from Hudson – to provoke violence and raise tensions as jurors were preparing to render a verdict in the Derek Chauvin case. More on that later. 

We hope you enjoy this week’s version of the Telegram and wanted to thank all of you again for spending part of your Friday with us!

Sincerely,






Tom Tiffany
Member of Congress

Standing up for those who keep us safe 
This week during a markup in the Judiciary Committee, I backed an amendment to protect our law enforcement officers from dangerous “defund the police,” efforts. You may recall that the push to decimate police budgets began last year, and continues to this day – with some prominent Democrat lawmakers characterizing all police as “intentionally racist” and demanding “no more policing [or] incarceration.”

I spoke in favor of police, and against the reckless and irresponsible efforts of lawmakers who have demonstrated a pattern of traveling around the country to incite violence – including in our own communities.  You can watch my statement in support of the amendment in the video below.


Watch: I supported Rep. Bishop's amendment to stop Democrats from defunding the police in the Judiciary Committee.

Democrats reject censure resolution 
Many of you know about the Member of Congress who traveled to Minneapolis this week for the sole purpose of fomenting violence on the eve of the jury verdict in the Derek Chauvin case. What that lawmaker did was so outrageous that it prompted an unprecedented rebuke from the trial judge in the case, who noted that the move could potentially lead to the case “being overturned.” Republicans responded by trying to reprimand that member for her conduct with a “censure” resolution. Unfortunately, not a single member of the majority party supported the effort, which was voted on Tuesday. You can read the text of the censure resolution here.

“Woke” warriors target school children 
We’ve written about the dangerous obsession with race that seems to be seeping into almost every aspect of life these days. From huge corporations telling their employees to “be less white,” to college campuses holding segregated graduation ceremonies, and even a race-based $5 billion Agriculture Department debt relief program (that I’m fighting to overturn), there are some who want to treat every American based on the color of their skin rather than their individual merits. Sadly, we learned this week that even children aren’t immune from this cruel and destructive effort when a New York school administrator was caught on tape admitting that the focus of the school’s “woke” curriculum is to “demonize white people for being born,” and make some students feel “less than”. You can listen to the shocking audio yourself, which is embedded here. The good news is that a growing number of parents are getting fed up with these discriminatory policies – and are stepping forward to say so. One even penned a now-viral letter on the topic that some of you may already have seen. If not, you can read it here. 

Medical examiner releases report in Capitol Police officer’s death 
Brian Sicknick, the Capitol Police officer who died one day after demonstrators unlawfully broke into the Capitol on January 6, died of natural causes according to the Washington, DC medical examiner. Several large news organizations had initially reported that Officer Sicknick was killed by rioters wielding a fire extinguisher, or as a result of being exposed to bear spray, but the medical examiner said there was no evidence of either. You can read more about that here.

Green New Deal doubles down on anti-energy agenda 
It just keeps coming back like a bad penny – only this penny could cost taxpayers trillions. This week Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York City reintroduced her “Green New Deal,” but there’s really nothing ‘new’ about it and it’s still a bad deal for American families and farmers. In addition to the price tag, the plan would dramatically expand the power of Washington, DC over our lives, further increase energy bills, and empower adversarial foreign regimes by undermining American energy independence. A better deal would be reinstating the Keystone XL pipeline, lifting President Biden’s ban on responsible public land energy development and getting back to American energy dominance.


                          Recent Legislation Dems swerve left with partisan Driver’s License bill  This week Judiciary Committee Democrats gave preliminary approval to another controversial piece of legislation without a single Republican vote. The bill, ironically named the “Driving for Opportunity Act,” would set aside $20 million to get rid of state laws that suspend or revoke the driver licenses of people who fail to pay a civil or criminal fine. They started with defund the police, which has harmed countless communities across our nation and undermined law and order efforts. That was not enough for them, so they moved to abolish the so called “no cash bail” system, which has encouraged lawlessness and has allowed for criminals to go back on the streets in record time, to victimize others. Now they are aiming to discredit and undermine the courts, state legislatures, and the will of the voters, by interfering in state governance. I will continue to defend the police, stand up for law and order, and push back against misguided efforts to undermine local control.  No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act (NOPEC)  For years, oil cartels have manipulated and fixed prices without being held accountable for their actions. In the past, they have manipulated markets, and Americans have paid the price, both at the pump and in other important sectors that depend heavily on natural resources. We gained the initiative in recent years thanks to President Trump’s bold American energy agenda, resulting in lower energy prices and improved national security. Under this administration, however, we have taken major steps backwards. New regulations being brought online and the cancellation of the very important Keystone pipeline don’t strengthen our national security or make us more energy independent—they make us more vulnerable. That’s bad news for American families and businesses. The NOPEC Act I supported this week aims to protect the American consumer from these unfair practices. But the long-term solution is to roll back the Biden administration’s job-killing, anti-affordable energy agenda.  Expanding opportunity for younger workers  This week I became a cosponsor of the DRIVE Safe Act. This bipartisan bill would allow certified commercial driver’s license (CDL) holders who are 18 to 20 to drive interstate and cross state lines. Currently, CDL holders who are in that age group are only allowed to drive intra-state, a restriction that deprives younger drivers of opportunities and makes it harder for trucking companies to fill vacancies. This bill would remove that roadblock, and open new “lanes” for young people to join a well-paying industry. The trucking industry employs many Wisconsinites with great jobs, so I’m glad to support legislation that will help more young people contribute to this vital industry and keep America moving.  Flexible Financing for Rural America Act  I also recently cosponsored an important, bipartisan broadband bill, titled the Flexible Financing for Rural America Act. This bipartisan bill would direct the United States Department of Agriculture to allow rural utility service (RUS) loan borrowers to request readjustments to their interest rates without penalty. Allowing electric cooperatives and rural telecommunications providers to take advantage of lower interest rates will help not only lessen the impact of COVID but also allow broadband to expand in rural areas across America. Keeping America connected and online is more important now than ever before, and I’m committed to working for better, more affordable and more accessible broadband. 

                            District Update
COVID-19 Update 
This week Wisconsin saw a decline in case numbers, down from an average of 833 cases per day to 671 cases per day. Hospitalizations continue to remain stable with no significant change in admission rates in both the Northwest and North Central HERC regions.

On the vaccine front, Wisconsin will hit another milestone this week with 4 million shots distributed. Currently, more than 1.6 million second doses have been distributed meaning nearly 30 percent of the population is fully vaccinated. Additionally, 75 percent of all seniors 65+ are now fully vaccinated, likely contributing to low hospitalization rates statewide. In addition to the mass vaccination sites located in Oneida, Marathon, and Eau Claire counties, DHS announced they will be opening another vaccination site in Douglas County. As always, if you wish to register for a vaccine appointment please utilize the state registry system here: https://vaccinate.wi.gov/en-US/.

                                  Resources    The USDA continues to make resources and assistance available to agricultural producers and working families to ensure access, safety and stability for food markets and supplies.   Small businesses can also apply for assistance through the Economic Injury and Disaster Loan program.

ICYMI: Bergman in Detroit News:
 
When Will Americans Be Free From COVID-19 Restrictions?
 
  

  
  
Read the full article here or below:
 
When I ran for Congress in 2016, I made it very clear that one of my main goals was to get the federal government off the back and out of the pockets of Michigan residents.
 
COVID-19 has thrown a wrench in all our lives and caused our dedicated experts, doctors and nurses to learn on the go. They’ve been working tirelessly to mitigate virus spread, find answers and develop vaccines and treatments. Yet through this process, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and our “government experts” have entered the twilight zone of federal rule and policymaking.
 
Many Americans feel as though we are indefinitely stuck in an uncomfortable and unsustainable new reality with no way out. These feelings are largely because our leading government scientists refuse to chart a clear course back to normalcy.
 
After all, we were told by leaders and experts more than 400 days ago that we simply needed 15 days to slow the spread. Then we were told we should not wear masks. Oops, now we must wear masks everywhere. Our restaurants and businesses must close — unless of course, you are a big-box store.
 
Then the experts said: Even with a vaccine, we still need to stay away from others; our restaurants can now be partly opened — but they must close at 10 p.m. Wait, now 11 p.m. is OK.
 
Our 2-year-olds need to wear masks now, although the CDC has “given us permission” to ride our bikes or walk outside without a mask.
 
These government regulations have been largely political. Over the last year, nearly every bureaucratic or government entity has failed to consider the hopelessness and damage they are inflicting.
 
Just a brief look into the permanent destruction done to the restaurant and tourism industries alone shows the devastating mark these shutdowns have caused. Michigan has had some of the longest shutdowns in the United States — causing more than 3,000 restaurants to close. Yet, the CDC recently pushed our governor to shut things down instead of focusing on vaccine availability and charting a realistic path forward for us.
 
In a recent hearing, the esteemed Dr. Anthony Fauci responded to the question of “When do Americans get their freedoms back?” by saying, “When we get the level of infection in this country low enough that it is not a really high threat.”
 
Since when was “not a really high threat” a scientific metric? This wouldn’t cut it in a business deal or our daily lives, so why should we allow this from our government?
 
Americans want accountability and real answers, but the tone-deaf response we get is finger-wagging about avoiding our normal lives, while Michigan bureaucrats and elected officials head to Florida.
 
The hopelessness and mistrust are only compounded when leaders like Fauci and President Joe Biden continue to push strict masking in most cases, even after getting vaccinated. Any reasonable citizen will question why it is necessary when we are told the vaccines are safe and effective.
 
After front-line workers became eligible to receive their vaccines, I made the personal decision to get mine — and I believe it truly is a personal decision. But the continued COVID theater by bureaucrats and politicians only compounds many Americans’ hesitancy to make these decisions.
 
Freedom-loving Americans are left to wonder: How and when do we get back to normal? Small businesses demand an answer. Working families demand an answer. Students demand an answer. Americans demand an answer.

READY TO WORK

Just two weeks after President Biden’s call for unity, Democratic congressional leaders have abandoned the bipartisan cooperation our country needs.
Republicans in Congress are ready to work on commonsense, targeted solutions to get Americans back to work, kids back to school, small businesses back on their feet, and life back to normal. 
But instead, Speaker Pelosi is plowing ahead with budget reconciliation to fast-track a one-sided, $1.9 trillion bill loaded with progressive priorities that will destroy jobs and make it harder for Main Street to rebuild our economy. That’s why I voted against Speaker Pelosi’s partisan budget resolution this week.

Despite President Biden’s words, his administration’s early actions have been aimed at advancing a radical left-wing agenda rather than getting hardworking Americans the help they need.
For instance, he rescinded the pro-life Mexico City Policy, eliminating vital protections against the use of taxpayer dollars to promote abortion.
He banned new oil and gas leasing and drilling on federal lands, setting the stage for a total ban that will cost an estimated one million jobs and drive up the cost of energy for American families and businesses.
And he issued an executive order blocking the Keystone XL pipeline, a decision that puts thousands of jobs at risk. That’s why I’m proud to cosponsor the Keystone XL Pipeline Construction and Jobs Preservation Act, which would save jobs and move America closer to energy independence.
We have an opportunity for bipartisan cooperation to get things done for the American people. It’s time for President Biden and Speaker Pelosi to put politics aside, stop pursuing a radical agenda, and let us get to work.
SAFE & EFFECTIVE VACCINE DEPLOYMENT

I’m fully confident the vaccines approved by the FDA are safe and effective, and they are the key to our nation’s recovery. I will continue working with federal, state, and local officials to ensure vaccine doses are distributed in our communities as efficiently as possible so that together we can defeat this invisible enemy. 
Indiana is continuing its phased plan to administer FDA-approved vaccines, starting with frontline health care workers, residents and staff of long-term care facilities, and now all Hoosiers aged 65 or older.
The state has opened hundreds of vaccination sites with at least one in every country, and so far 661,033 Hoosiers have been vaccinated. Vaccines administered by the state are free to all Indiana residents, but insurance may be charged an administrative fee.
To register and to find the nearest vaccination clinic, call 2-1-1 or visit OurShot.in.gov. The second dose will be scheduled at the clinic when the first dose is administered. A caregiver or loved one also may make an appointment on behalf of an eligible senior.
Attention Hoosier veterans – the St. Joseph County VA Clinic will be providing free COVID-19 vaccinations to veterans by appointment only. For more information or to schedule an appointment, call 1-800-360-8387 ext. 75113.
REMINDER for veterans who have scheduled an appointment – the clinic is providing vaccinations TODAY, February 6th, between 8:00am to 3:30pm ET, at 1540 Trinity Place in Mishawaka.

4/7/21 11:37,How I'm Working to Improve Access to the COVID-19 Vaccine in PA-05,"NEWSLETTER
 
 
WEBSITE     |     CONTACT     


Dear neighbor,
I wanted to give you an update on some of our efforts to increase vaccine distribution in Delaware County, Montgomery County, and Philadelphia. I’m sure you share my frustration with the pace of vaccine distribution in Pennsylvania. My team and I have been working hard to get more doses to PA-05, and particularly to the communities that have the most trouble accessing health care. 
In addition to supporting efforts by local officials to increase and streamline the distribution of vaccines from the state, our office has been working to increase the supply of vaccines to our region from the federal government. One of our first efforts was to set up a pipeline of vaccines from the federal government to federally qualified health centers in the district, including ChesPenn. Since this program was approved, ChesPenn will begin receiving thousands of additional doses which can be administered to Medicare and Medicaid recipients.
We also looked at neighborhoods in PA-05 that lacked access to vaccines, and were able to form a partnership with Rite Aid, one of the companies supplying federally allocated doses at retail pharmacies, to bring vaccination clinics to some of those neighborhoods. With Rite Aid’s support, we were able to help identify trusted community organizations to create one-day pop-up clinics to get the vaccines to communities in need.   

 Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon visits Eastwick United Methodist Church Vaccine Clinic on March 27th, 2021

So far, through these partnerships, we helped bring almost a thousand additional doses to PA-05. I want to thank Rite Aid, Eastwick United Methodist Church, Widener University in Chester, and Union Memorial United Methodist Church in Darby for their hard work to organize and staff these clinics.
Here is county-by-county info on how you can get vaccinated:
DELCO:
	•	Currently vaccinating people in Phase 1A and 1B. 
	•	People who live or work in Delaware County can now pre-register for the COVID-19 vaccine by completing a form found on the Chester County Health Department’s COVID-19 website at https://www.chesco.org/4822/COVID19Vaccine 
	•	Delco has also established a vaccine call center to answer your questions—you can reach them at Phone: (484) 276-2100 or Email:Covid19Resources@co.delaware.pa.us 
	•	The Delco call center (contact info above) can be used to sign for the Homebound COVID-19 Vaccination Program—which is working to vaccinate up to 500 homebound residents per week. 
MONTCO:
	•	Currently vaccinating people in Phase 1A and 1B. 
	•	People can pre-register for the vaccine through a link on the MontCo website at https://www.montcopa.org/ 
 PHILLY:
	•	 Currently vaccinating people in Phase 1A, 1B, and 1C. Note: Philadelphia's vaccine eligibility phases differ from those established by the Commonwealth. 
	•	You can find your eligibility on the Philadelphia government website at https://www.phila.gov/. 
	•	On that website, you can also sign up on the Interest Form to reserve your spot in the vaccine line. 
	•	Once you sign up, you will receive communication via email or a call to schedule your appointment and given the location of your vaccination site. 
The end of this pandemic is on the horizon, but we will not stop pushing for more doses until every resident in PA-05 is vaccinated. Even if you’ve been vaccinated, please continue to wear a mask and practice social distancing. We have to hold on just a little while longer to keep our communities safe.   To be sure you’re receiving every update from our office, please sign up for our email newsletter. 
Best wishes, 
Mary Gay

5/1/21 9:32,The Original American Jobs Plan,"Congressman Smith's E-news: May 1, 2021  

The Original American Jobs Plan

This week President Biden delivered his first address to a joint session of Congress. He began by acknowledging the success of the COVID-19 vaccine development under the previous administration while touting its rollout under his own. Getting as many Americans as possible vaccinated is a key to reopening and rebuilding the economy across our country, and we should rightfully be proud of how quickly American ingenuity led to this lifesaving development. Unfortunately, President Biden’s remarks then moved on to his so-called American Jobs Plan, his wide-ranging proposal which is being sold as an effort to rebuild our infrastructure and get Americans back to work. While I have broad concerns about the size and scope of the President’s spending plans, I am most concerned that he is working rapidly to unwind many of the accomplishments, like regulatory and tax relief, which had our economy at record highs prior to COVID-19.

Under the Trump Administration, regulatory relief focused on consistently enforcing existing laws that provided certainty for farmers, ranchers, and small businesses, all while protecting the environment and enhancing our conservation efforts. Unfortunately, the Biden Administration has been consistently upending these gains. President Trump repealed the Obama-era rule expanding the Waters of the United States, or WOTUS, and replaced it with the “Navigable Waters of the United States” rule which would allow regulators to protect water appropriately. Now within his first 100 days, President Biden has pulled back his predecessor’s rule, and with it unilaterally cancelled other items like the Keystone XL Pipeline and oil and gas leasing of federal lands and waters, actions that are simply counterproductive. Businesses need to know the rules will be consistently enforced in order to make long-term hiring decisions. This uncertainty hinders that planning at a time when we need to return more Americans to the workforce.
 
Likewise President Biden’s tax proposals, while framed as an effort to bring “fairness” to our tax code, would ultimately upend the careful balance struck by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which made the United States an attractive place to invest capital with a competitive corporate tax rate while implementing the strongest-ever provisions to prevent companies from cheating the system by intentionally moving money and jobs to low-tax countries to avoid U.S. tax bills. While President Biden claims his proposals would keep more corporate tax dollars in the U.S., the ultimate result of combining higher rates with more punitive base erosion measures would be discouraging far more capital from moving here.
 
Despite the difficulty of this past year, America is rebounding. Cities are starting to heal, and businesses are opening again, but we must keep the momentum going by connecting more workers with jobs, returning our children to schools, and safely reopening our nation. In my role on the Ways and Means Committee, I will continue to defend the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to benefit the American people, and I will provide support for Nebraskans as we aim for an economic revival. We had great success over the past four years regarding the economy, our trade agreements, and tax policy, and now it is time we build on those triumphs.

The American Rescue Plan is set to pass the House of Representatives very soon! Once it is passed, we will be one step closer to securing much-needed relief for Central Floridians in need. 

The plan will help us defeat COVID-19, support businesses and essential workers, reopen schools safely, deliver relief to working families and increase our vaccination efforts. It includes funding for testing, tracing, personal protective equipment and other necessary investments to ensure that students can safely return to the classroom. The American Rescue Plan also ensures immediate relief for households struggling economically by providing economic impact payments, direct housing assistance, an expanded Child Tax Credit, extended unemployment benefits and more. Additionally, the plan supports businesses affected by systemic discrimination with EIDL grants and expanded PPP eligibility among other things. 

The following State and Local Fiscal Relief Funds will go to Central Florida’s Counties: 

	•	Osceola County: $73 million 
	•	Orange County: $270 million 
	•	Polk County: $141 million 

While we are proud to see our efforts to provide aid succeed, this moment also leads us to reflect on everything we have encountered as a nation since the onset of this pandemic. We've been faced with uncertainties, unforeseeable situations and moments that have required us to step up and show up for one another. 

This week, we surpassed 500,000 American lives lost to this virus. Each loss serves as a reminder of the severity of this pandemic and the importance of doing our part to protect ourselves and those around us. 

We've worn masks and socially distanced, and currently have the opportunity to save lives by getting vaccinated once we're eligible. The existence of multiple safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 is a testament to the resilience our nation exhibits when faced with difficult moments.

Celebrating 25 years of 
﻿Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI)
 

On Monday, we discussed Latino student success, COVID-19 relief and the U.S. Citizenship Act with students from Valencia College, the University of Central Florida, Florida International University, and more. I admire the opportunity to learn more about the perspective of our next generation of leaders! 
 

Meeting with advocates from the ONE Campaign
 

Constituents from the ONE Campaign updated me on the global movement to end extreme poverty and preventable disease by 2030 with justice and equality. 
 

Discussing global child immunization programs
 

I had an informative meeting with constituents from the Shot@Life campaign regarding the value of U.S. investments in global child immunization programs and their contribution to the global COVID-19 response. 

In Washington, D.C. 

Securing non-discrimination protections
 

House Democrats proudly passed H.R. 5, the Equality Act to secure non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ Americans in housing, employment, education, public accommodations, and more. It is our responsibility to ensure that all Americans are protected from discrimination. 
 

Addressing COVID-19 vaccine concerns
 

During an Energy and Commerce Committee hearing, I asked Soledad O'Brien about the importance of conversations grounded on facts and led by science. We must address the mistrust and false information surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine with truth about its safety and efficacy. 
 

Protecting public lands for a healthier future
 

I voted in favor of a package of bills that protect 1.5 million acres of wilderness, 1,000 miles of river and the Grand Canyon from mining. By passing this package, we are able to secure a better, cleaner and healthier future for all Americans.

Thanks to President Biden, there is now a Special Enrollment Period to give you the opportunity to enroll in coverage for the remainder of 2021.

4/30/21 13:47,100 days,"The latest from Congressman Cicilline
 
Dear Lindsey, 
In his first 100 days, President Biden has taken bold action to address multiple crises facing our country. In the midst of a global pandemic, he has led the way as we delivered much-needed relief for families, small businesses, and communities that are struggling. On Wednesday, in his address to Congress, he made clear that his administration is committed to building on this progress and making a once-in-a-generation investment to create good-paying jobs. 
I was also pleased that the President addressed his plans for police reform, immigration, gun safety, and crushing the pandemic so we can return to our lives before this pandemic changed everything. This was a speech that spoke directly to the American people and to the challenges facing working families. 
I look forward to working with the President, his administration, and my colleagues in Congress to deliver these results to the American people. 
American Families Plan
The American Families Plan is a historic investment in education, health care, and child care – the foundations of middle class prosperity. By investing in America’s children, families, and our economic future, we can pave a new road to the middle class for millions of people. 
The American Families Plan will make education more affordable and expand opportunity by providing universal access to high-quality, free Pre-K for 3- and 4- year olds, making two years of community college free for all Americans, and increasing the maximum Pell Grant by $1,400 and allowing DREAMers to access this funding. It will provide families with a new level of economic security by providing comprehensive paid family and medical leave, expanding nutrition assistance and school meal programs, and bringing down the cost of child care. And it pays for these important initiatives with real tax reform that rewards work, not wealth, and makes certain everyone pays their fair share, especially the richest American and the most profitable corporations. 
I will update you on the progress of this important plan and I look forward to sending it to the President’s desk for his signature. 
Helping our Restaurants
Bars and restaurants were hit especially hard throughout the coronavirus pandemic, and we knew this when we developed the American Rescue Plan. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, registration for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund (RRF) begins today and the Small Business Administration (SBA) will begin accepting applications via the application portal on Monday, May 3 at 12 p.m. EDT. The application portal will remain open to any eligible establishment until all funds are exhausted. 
For more information, visit sba.gov/restaurants. 
Getting the COVID Vaccine
People ages 16 and older who live, work, or go to school in Rhode Island are now eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. If you are eligible, you can schedule an appointment at a State-run vaccination site by visiting www.vaccinateRI.org, and in some cases walk-ins are available. For help, call 844-930-1779 or 211.

Dear Friend, 
  
This week I joined more than 200 Republicans in sending a letter to Speaker Pelosi demanding a full investigation to address the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) complicity in obscuring the origins of COVID-19.
  
Holding China accountable 
  
With evidence mounting that COVID-19 started in a Chinese lab, followed by a subsequent cover-up, the letter calls on Speaker Pelosi to instruct the appropriate Democrat committee chairs to immediately join Republicans to hold the CCP accountable.

I had the opportunity to participate in the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs’ Member Day hearing and speak about frustrations I’ve been hearing from veterans who are waiting up to a year or more to receive records from the National Personnel Records Center. That's unacceptable and we must work to ensure our veterans receive records in a timely fashion.

VA offering walk-in COVID-19 vaccinations nationwide 
  
All Department of Veterans Affairs facilities and clinics that administer COVID-19 vaccines are accepting walk-ins for eligible Veterans, spouses and caregivers.
  
“VA encourages those who wish to get their COVID-19 vaccine without an appointment to check the walk-in hours and requirements at their local facility,” said Acting VA Under Secretary for Health Richard Stone, M.D. “ Individuals taking advantage of walk-in vaccinations may need to wait for the vaccine to be prepared and will be screened when entering the facility.” For more information about COVID-19 vaccinations at VA, click here.

On Thursday, I praised the agreement between the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to begin construction of the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) Storage Reservoir. The Project Partnership Agreement allows for the construction of the EAA Storage Reservoir, which was authorized as part of the Central Everglades Planning Project (CEPP) thanks to my efforts. In 2020, I secured a provision in the Water Resources Development Act of 2020 to force the Army Corps to move forward with construction of the EAA Reservoir, after the Army Corps bureaucracy ignored Congressional intent and delayed the project. The agreement to initiate construction of the Federal portion of the Reservoir was made possible by my efforts. Read more here.

Covid-19 Education Funding
  


2020 was a year full of challenges that tested Missourians in ways we have never experienced. Life was put on hold for several months, we lost Missourians to the virus, our medical community worked around the clock, and many livelihoods were lost when small businesses who couldn’t stay afloat were forced to close their doors. Thankfully, life in our state is going back to normal for most of us with businesses reopening and the vaccine becoming increasingly available. But there is one group of Missourians who could potentially feel the effects of the pandemic for years to come: our children.
The CDC estimates the average cost to return safely to school is approximately $442 per student nationwide. But the COVID-19 relief funding formula used by the federal government prioritizes some school districts while overlooking others. Here in Missouri, Blair Oaks only gets $77.47 per child, while Kansas City receives nearly $2,000 per child. Wentzville only receives $163.17 per child while St. Louis City gets almost $2,200. This disparity taking place throughout the nation completely ignores the science and falls far short of fair. To fix this problem, I introduced an amendment to the last COVID-19 relief package that would equally distribute funds based on the number of students in a school district and ensure all schools have the necessary funds to safely return to in-person learning. Unfortunately, Democrats did not allow my amendment to receive a vote on the House Floor.
While the bill was passed with that formula, there is still time to create fairness for our students. The funding will be disbursed in portions until 2022. I have introduced the Protecting Every Student Act which, like the amendment, would allocate funding in a much fairer way by using a per pupil basis, allowing all school districts to receive the appropriate funding. It is unacceptable that our children struggle with lockdowns that have derailed their educational and social development only to have their health politicized. When it comes to health and safety, every student regardless of location, wealth, or political precinct should be treated fairly by our government.  CONTACT US: As always, for those of you with Internet access, I encourage you to visit my official website.

Last night, I voted for H.R. 133, the fiscal year 2021 appropriations omnibus agreement, which includes a desperately needed $900 billion emergency coronavirus (COVID-19) relief package. 
There’s no doubt that this emergency COVID-19 relief legislation falls far short of meaningfully addressing our numerous priorities; however, I also recognize that the bill provides important and immediate relief that we urgently need in order to avoid further devastation. This $900 billion package will prevent an eviction crisis, secure rent, food, enhanced unemployment funds, and direct payments for families – including mixed-status families – and accelerate the free and equitable distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine.
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in El Paso have been catastrophic and deeply painful: over 1,300 El Pasoans have died, more than 8,000 filed for unemployment in November, and 1 in 5 children are suffering from food insecurity. My office has been flooded with emails and phone calls from El Pasoans worried about evictions, who don’t know how they’re going to pay rent next month, whether they’ll be able to put food on the table for their families, or when they’ll find a job and steady income again.
From the early days of this deadly pandemic, I’ve sounded the alarm about the crushing impact this would have on minority communities like ours, bringing illness and deaths at higher rates. I have advocated and voted for critical relief legislation at every opportunity in order to protect the lives and livelihoods of El Paso families, workers, and small businesses.
I know El Pasoans desperately need and deserve more, and I advocated for more, but this bill is a start. I’ll continue to work on bigger and bolder relief legislation and work in the upcoming months with the Biden-Harris administration to combat the pandemic and alleviate the pain our families, community, and economy are facing.
Here are some of the COVID-19 relief priorities my colleagues and I fought to be included in the year-end funding package:
	•	Accelerating vaccine distribution and crushing the coronavirus: The bipartisan COVID-19 relief package finally recognizes that we cannot get our economy working unless we can get the coronavirus under control. The package provides billions in urgently need funds to accelerate the free and equitable distribution of safe vaccines to as many Americans as possible as soon as possible, to implement a strong national testing and tracing strategy with billions reserved specifically for combating the disparities facing communities of color, and to support our heroic health care workers and providers.
	•	Strong support for small business: My colleagues and I secured critical funding and policy changes to help small businesses, including minority-owned businesses, and nonprofits recover from the pandemic. The agreement includes over $284 billion for first and second forgivable PPP loans, expanded PPP eligibility for nonprofits and local newspapers, TV and radio broadcasters, key modifications to PPP to serve the smallest businesses and struggling non-profits and better assist independent restaurants, and includes $15 billion in dedicated funding for live venues, independent movie theaters, and cultural institutions. The agreement also includes $20 billion for targeted EIDL Grants which are critical to many smaller businesses on Main Street.
	•	Rental assistance: My colleagues and I secured $25 billion in critically needed rental assistance for families struggling to stay in their homes and an extension of the eviction moratorium.
	•	Direct payment checks: Despite opposition from Republicans in Congress, Democrats secured a new round of direct payments worth up to $600 per adult and child, also ensuring that mixed-status families receive payments.
	•	Strengthened Earned Income Tax Credit & Child Tax Credit: The agreement helps ensure that families who faced unemployment or reduced wages during the pandemic are able to receive a strong tax credit based on their 2019 income, preserving these vital income supports for vulnerable families.
	•	Supports paid sick leave: The agreement provides a tax credit to support employers offering paid sick leave, based on the Families First framework.
	•	Enhanced Unemployment Insurance benefits: My colleagues and I averted the sudden expiration of Unemployment Insurance benefits for millions and added a $300 per week UI enhancement for Americans out of work.
	•	Nutrition assistance for hungry families: My colleagues and I secured $13 billion in increased SNAP and child nutrition benefits to help relieve the historic hunger crisis that has left up to 17 million children food insecure. Additionally, the package included $400 million for food banks and $130 million for FEMA’s Emergency Food and Shelter program.
	•	Education and child care: The agreement provides $82 billion in funding for colleges and schools, including support for HVAC repair and replacement to mitigate virus transmission and reopen classrooms, and $10 billion for child care assistance to help get parents back to work and keep child care providers open.
	•	 Relieving grieving families: Congresswoman Escobar and Democrats in Congress secured up to $2 billion in FEMA assistance through states for families with funeral expenses due to COVID-19 through December 31, 2020. 
A summary of the Bipartisan Agreement on COVID-19 Relief available here and the bill text is available here.
As these benefits become available in the coming weeks, please rest assured I will be working tirelessly to ensure El Pasoans are able to receive the desperately needed benefits as soon as possible. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact my office at (915) 541-1400 or via email at Veronica.Escobar@mail.house.gov.
Staying Safe This Holiday Season
More than 1.6 million COVID-19 cases were reported in the United States over the last 7 days. As cases continue to dangerously increase in El Paso and across the country, the safest way to celebrate the holidays this year is to celebrate virtually or at home with the people you live with. Travel and gatherings with family and friends who do not live with you can increase the chances of getting or spreading COVID-19.
Though it is strongly recommended that you do not gather this holiday season, if you do choose to attend a gathering, here are some critical steps to take:
	•	Have conversations with the host ahead of time to understand expectations for celebrating together. 
	•	Wear a mask with two or more layers that covers your nose and mouth. 
	•	Stay at least 6 feet away from others who do not live with you. 
	•	Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. 
	•	Encourage guests to bring food and drinks for themselves and for members of their own household only; avoid potluck-style gatherings.

Being away from family and friends during the holidays can be especially hard and it’s very important to take care of your mental health. Please know that you are not alone and there are resources available to help you. For additional and local mental health resources available to you and your loved ones, click here.

Show Me a Great Vaccination Plan

 
Several weeks ago I wrote about the breakthrough that is mRNA vaccines and their safety and efficacy. Thanks to President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed, the United States has led the way in vaccine manufacturing, distribution, and administration. From the moment we knew an effective vaccine was on the horizon, Missouri Governor Mike Parson and his team came up with a plan to get vaccines into peoples arms while the federal government worked on getting vaccines to the states. The plan that state government officials came up with and executed has worked extremely well. 
Like many states, Missouri administered its vaccines in phases, first going to the most vulnerable in our population and health care workers, then to at-risk individuals, then to front-line workers, and finally to any individual who wants one. Missouri moved through these phases quickly to ensure that the state could get to a point where vaccines are available to every resident. The Governor and his team have also been transparent with the data and vaccine availability throughout every step of the process. COVID-19 vaccination data is updated regularly and is publicly available at https://covidvaccine.mo.gov/data/ for anyone to see. At this dashboard, anyone can monitor the state’s vaccination rate and view data based on age, sex, race, or ethnicity. You can also view county-level vaccination rates.
Missouri has made great progress in getting vaccines into arms. As of this week, over 3.8 million doses have been administered and over 1.6 million people have completed vaccination. Overall, 37.1% of Missouri residents have initiated or completed their vaccinations. These numbers are even more impressive for the elderly. 62.7% of residents between the ages of 65 and 74 have completed vaccination and 65.7% of residents between the age of 75 and 84 have completed their vaccination. In the most populous county in Southwest Missouri, Greene County, 1 in every 4 individuals has completed vaccination. These numbers are impressive, and I am glad to see the elderly population embrace the vaccine, but there is still work to be done.
For example, we can make getting a COVID-19 vaccine easier and more convenient. In Joplin, a drive-thru clinic has made it so you never need to leave your car to get vaccinated. This is a model that some clinics are already doing and can be replicated on a larger scale. Convenience is a good way to get folks to turn out for a vaccine. If getting a vaccine is a hassle, people may not go out of their way to get vaccinated. Convenience and simplicity are key, and Missouri is making great progress on that front. 
These COVID-19 vaccines have been tested, approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and are proven to be safe and effective. I consulted with my doctor to make sure taking the vaccine was the right thing for me to do. After being assured it posed no risks to me I did go ahead and receive my vaccine and I encourage everyone who is able to sign up to receive theirs after consulting with their doctor. The state has made the process of registering to receive your COVID-19 vaccine straightforward and simple. You can register at https://covidvaccine.mo.gov/find/#navigator.  where you will be asked to submit some information about yourself. You will be able to identify vaccination events in your area and schedule an appointment. You can also call Missouri’s COVID-19 hotline at (877) 435-8411 to sign up and schedule your appointment.
I have said before how there is light at the end of the tunnel, and thanks to the effort of Governor Parson and his team, that light is even brighter for Missourians. Infection rates and hospitalizations in Missouri are down and folks are getting their vaccines. If you haven’t received your vaccine yet, I would encourage you to either sign up through the state’s portal or find a vaccinator near you. You can find a local vaccinator at https://covidvaccine.mo.gov/find/#map.

1/2/21 9:54,New Year. New Opportunities - Part 1,"January 2, 2021 
Dear Fellow Marylander, 
Happy New Year! We’ve scraped through what possibly was the longest and most consequential year of our lives.
As we look at 2020 in the rearview mirror, we also look to the year ahead with optimism tinged with the knowledge that things likely will get worse before they get better. 
Our nation is facing record-high deaths, hospitalizations, and COVID-19 cases in our country. Our hospitals are being stretched to capacity. We are now on track to surpass 400,000 lives lost to the virus before the end of January. 
Unfortunately, because not everyone has followed the basic public health guidelines of wearing a mask, staying six feet from someone outside your household and washing hands frequently, we have to anticipate that infections from holiday outings and gatherings soon will produce growing case counts – and a soaring death toll. Even though we are beginning to roll out the revolutionary vaccines that the scientific community has delivered in an incredibly short time, it may not be until spring that we begin to see significant improvements in our overall public health threshold.   
Our highest priority for 2021 is finally to execute a comprehensive, coordinated federal response to turn the tide against COVID-19. I know this is the highest priority for President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, both of whom will be sworn into office on January 20 
The Biden-Harris administration will need to clean up the deadly mess left behind by President Trump. For starters, the current plan to distribute vaccines is falling behind so badly that we are nowhere near 20 million vaccinations by the end of the year, as promised. 
As the new Congress is sworn into office tomorrow (January 3), my colleagues and I should be ready to work with the new administration and support its efforts to confront this virus fully and properly. The rapid, widespread distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine is quite possibly the greatest operational challenge we have faced as a nation. Congress must give the new administration the resources it needs to save American lives. 
This country cannot achieve an economic recovery, or make needed progress on countless other pressing issues, until we course-correct toward a public health recovery. But delivering that will take far more than getting appropriate amounts of vaccines, distributed equitably and free of charge, to every community in the country.
Emerging from the pandemic also will require a massive public education campaign to amplify the importance of getting vaccinated. Not only do we need to overcome the natural hesitation to get a needle in the arm, we must combat the effects of the chronic misinformation from those who diminish the lethality of the virus or dismiss it as “just the flu."" 
We also must encourage and embrace bold executive actions, like the use of the Defense Production Act, to meet the pandemic’s continued public health and economic challenges. Similar to the regional problems faced in March and April, currently, many frontline medical personnel nationwide are dealing with critical day-to-day shortages of personal protective equipment and therapeutic supplies; shortfalls in testing continue to delay diagnoses; and there are acute needs in the realm of vaccine materials that need to be addressed immediately.
While President Trump primarily used the Defense Production Act to shield companies from the threat of lawsuits from workers who may become infected, my sincere hope is that the new Biden-Harris administration will use the tools they have to truly elevate the public health, not corporate liability protections
Like so many other things, the Trump administration also has been erratic in its consultation with all governors nationwide, leading to critical communication breakdowns in several states that are slowing vaccine and medical supply distribution. This often-partisan dynamic must cease immediately. I am heartened to see a series of bipartisan conversations underway between President-Elect Biden and governors from across the country, and I trust that these essential exchanges will continue.    
We must inject a renewed spirit of action for the collective good. Wearing a mask must be automatic. Social distancing, however challenging, has to be our continued modus operandi.  And “wash your hands” must remain our mantra.
This pandemic is not insurmountable. Its effects have been devastating, and its shadow long. But we can emerge from it. I know we can. Finally having a true partner and leader in the White House will go a long way toward easing America’s suffering. 
This will be in the front of my mind next week when the House and Senate will meet in a joint session to officially receive and count the electoral votes that confirm the election of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.
I’ve likely never welcomed a new year – or a new administration – quite so fervently. 
Thank you for joining me in helping to change the momentum of this pandemic, and this nation.
Your friend and public servant,

5/22/21 9:51,Get Your Shot!,"May 21, 2021
Dear New Jerseyan,
I wanted to talk to you for a brief moment about the COVID-19 vaccine. Every American over age 12 is now eligible to receive a vaccine against this deadly virus, and it has never been easier to get one of these safe, effective, and free vaccines. We have the ability to bring this horrible disease under control, so even if you don’t read the rest of this email and you haven’t gotten vaccinated yet, please go to www.vaccines.gov, text your zip code to 438829, or call 1-800-232-0233 right now to find out the easiest way to get your shot! 
Thanks to rigorous scientific studies, we know these vaccines are safe and extremely effective, not only at lowering your risk of getting the virus, but also at preventing severe cases that require hospitalization. As I got my own shot, I thought about how grateful I was for the diverse group of scientists, researchers, health care professionals, delivery people, agriculture and food service workers, warehouse workers, and all of those who've worked tirelessly on developing and distributing these safe and effective vaccines. Because of their hard work, more families will not have to know the loss that hundreds of thousands of Americans felt this past year. 
Now is our chance to protect ourselves and help our communities by getting vaccinated. 
If you or someone you love hasn’t been vaccinated yet, I want to personally encourage you to make your first appointment or help your loved one make theirs to get vaccinated. Everyone who gets a vaccine is doing their part to get us out of this crisis.
If you’ve already received the vaccine, please encourage those around you to do so. Those who are hesitant, or just haven’t gotten around to it yet, will be more likely to get the vaccine if people they know and trust talk to them about it.
We are on the precipice of moving past this pandemic, and building a better future for all Americans. Get your shot today.
Sincerely,  
Cory A. Booker United States Senator

2/28/21 10:03,This Week on Buddy's Briefing,"THIS WEEK ON BUDDY'S BRIEFING

This week, House Democrats passed the $1.9 trillion Biden Bailout Bill. This package is the wrong plan, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons.

It is the wrong plan because it will incentivize lockdowns that have harmed our workers and children for too long.

It is the wrong time because our economy is improving, and we have yet to spend $1 trillion of previously approved funding. In fact, just this week it was reported that jobless claims dropped dramatically.

Worst of all, less than 9 percent of the $2 trillion bill directly goes to combating COVID-19. The remainder goes to a partisan wish list of priorities. 

Congress must address the pandemic, but this is certainly not the way to do it. 

We discuss this and more in this episode of Buddy's Briefing.

INCREASING ACCESS TO TELEHEALTH FOR SENIORS

This week I introduced the Telehealth Modernization Act to increase access to telehealth for seniors. 

Telehealth has been a vital tool during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for vulnerable Medicare patients. As vaccines are administered and we become closer to combating this virus, one thing that should remain is the unprecedented access to the use of telehealth that was created during the pandemic. 

My legislation permanently removes Medicare's geographic and originating site restrictions which require a patient to live in a rural area and be physically in a doctor's office or clinic to use telehealth services. The Telehealth Modernization Act permanently ends these restrictions to allow patients to use telehealth services no matter where they are. 

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCCI

Monday, February 22, 2021:  I spent this past weekend in Salt Lake City, UT, attending a conservative climate conference where we heard from a number of scientists as well as stakeholders.  Among those we heard from were representatives from The Conservation Coalition, Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the Bureau of Energy Resources.  The discussion revolved around the science of climate change and the future for conservatives in climate.  After our all-staff conference call this morning, I meet with my good friend and one of our many fine business leaders in the First District, Kevin Jackson, before heading to our Savannah District office where, along with my Congressional colleagues Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE) and Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA), I have a conference call with National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Francis Collins and members of his staff to discuss the lack of racial data for vaccinations and the lack of trust minority communities have with the vaccine.  After a great discussion with Dr. Collins and staff, I have a phone interview with NPR to talk about changes to mail-in ballot and voter ID laws in Georgia.  Next, I have a Budget Committee markup on the $1.9 trillion Biden Bailout Bill or American Rescue Plan as the Democrats refer to it as.  In the spirit of bipartisanship, we Republicans offer numerous amendments to the bill and, not surprisingly, none are accepted by the Democratic majority.  A link to amendments that I offer during the committee meeting can be found here.  Once the hearing is concluded and the bill is rammed through the committee, I have a Doctors Caucus conference call where we discuss health care amendments that we will be offering once the Biden Bailout Bill is debated in the Rules Committee later this week.

Tuesday, February 23, 2021:  I begin the day with a virtual call with ONE, a global movement campaigning to end extreme poverty and preventable disease by 2030, particularly in Africa.  I have met with this group every year I have served in Congress and have always been impressed with their advocacy.  Afterwards, I have a virtual call with my good friend Mary Jane Crouch, CEO of America’s Second Harvest as she brings me up to date on their legislative priorities.  Next, I join in on an Energy and Commerce (E&C) Oversight and Investigations (O&I) Subcommittee hearing on expanding availability of the COVID-19 vaccine.  Although I am not a member of this particular subcommittee, I am allowed to waive on and ask questions.  A link to my questions can be found here. 

Members of Congress hold a moment of silence to honor the 500,000 Americans lost to COVID-19
Afterwards, I head to the airport, and once at the Capitol, I have a Whip Team conference call to discuss the agenda for this week.  Next, I head to the Capitol steps where I join leadership and Members of Congress for a moment of silence to honor the 500,000 Americans lost to COVID-19.  Afterwards, I head to the House Chamber where we have our first vote series of the day and remain there afterwards to deliver a memorial to Tommy Seipel, who passed recently.  A link to my memorial can be found here.

Wednesday, February 24, 2021:  After a GOP security briefing where we hear from the Acting Sergeant at Arms, Acting Chief of the U.S. Capitol Police and Commanding General of the D.C. National Guard, we have our weekly GOP Conference meeting.  Next, I head to the House Chamber where I deliver tributes to the National Museum of the Mighty Eighth Air Force, Thiokol explosion 50th anniversary, Ware County Sheriff Randy Royal and pharmacists administering the COVID-19 vaccine.  A link to my tributes can be found here, here, here and here.  Afterwards, I head to the Cannon Rotunda where I have a live interview on Fox Business to discuss the COVID-19 vaccine rollout and the Biden Bailout. 

Rep. Carter appears on Fox Business
A link to my interview can be found here.  Next, I head back to the House Chamber for our first vote series of the day before returning to my office and joining in on a virtual E&C Communications and Technology Subcommittee hearing on disinformation and extremism in the media.  A link to my questions can be found here.  Afterwards, I have a meeting with representatives from Waffle House who are in town visiting before joining in on a virtual call with representatives from the Association of Accessible Medicines.  Next, I head back to the House Chamber for our second vote series of the day before heading to an E&C Republican member retreat off of Capitol Hill. 

Thursday, February 25, 2021:  My day starts early as I have a Doctors Caucus meeting where we discuss our budget amendments we are offering to the Rules Committee tomorrow.  We also meet with leadership to discuss how we can assist them in crafting health care legislation.  Afterwards, I head to the House Chamber where I deliver tributes to former Bryan County Sheriff Clyde Smith, Will Ingram, the City of Richmond Hill and Betty Miner.  A link to my tributes can be found here, here, here and here. 

Rep. Carter speaks on the House Floor
Next, I have a phone interview with NBC News to discuss pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and independent retail pharmacies before heading back off of Capitol Hill where I spend most of the afternoon in our E&C Republican member retreat.  Once back on Capitol Hill, I have a phone interview with Inside Health Policy to discuss PBMs and independent retail pharmacies before heading to the House Chamber for our first vote series of the day.  Once back in my office I have a virtual call with Savannah constituents of the Garden Club of America. 

Friday, February 26, 2021:  I begin today by attending a Rules Committee parliamentary bootcamp session to learn more about the intricacies of the parliamentary rules governing the House.  Afterwards, I head to the Budget Committee hearing room in the Cannon House Office Building where I record this week’s edition of Buddy’s Briefing before heading to the House Chamber for our first vote series of the day that includes 5 votes and lasts over 4 hours. 

Rep. Carter filming Buddy's Briefing
After heading back to my office where I finally catch up on some work, I join in virtually on the Rules Committee meeting where they are considering the $1.9 trillion Biden Bailout Bill.  During the debate, I offer three amendments to the committee for their consideration.  A link to my presentation can be found here.  After the Rules Committee rejects all amendments offered by Republicans, they send the package to the House floor where it is debated.  Around 10:00 p.m. I head to the House Chamber where we vote on the rule and then debate passage of the bill.  During the debate I speak against passage of the bill. 

Rep. Carter speaks against the Biden Bailout Bill
A link to my comments can be found here.  Our final vote is held at 1:00 a.m. Saturday morning and the $1.9 trillion Biden Bailout Bill is passed along partisan lines without a single Republican vote.

Dear Friend,
 
I wanted to share some good news: Congress has finally passed another COVID-19 relief package. It is now waiting for the President's signature.
 
This package is far from perfect -- I have fought for higher direct payments, more money for unemployed workers, and support for state and local governments -- but I'm glad we were able to rise above the gridlock and deliver some relief for the families and businesses on the Central Coast who have suffered for too long.  
 
Here's what this package would mean for Central Coast residents: 
 
✔ Direct Payments: Every child and adult earning up to $75,000 will recieve a $600 stimulus check. Most families of four will recieve $2,400. See how much you'll recieve using the calculator below.
  
Stimulus Check Calculator
  
✔ Extended Unemployment: Americans on unemployment will recieve an extra $300 a week from the federal government through at least March 14th. 
 
✔ Nutrition Assistance: SNAP benefits will increase by 15% through June 2021. 
 
✔ Support for Small Business: The Paycheck Protection Program will reopen, and the package includes over $284 billion for first and second forgivable loans. 
 
✔ Housing Security: Extends the eviction moratorium, which was set to expire next week, and provides $25 billion in rental assistance to keep families housed. 
 
✔ Vaccines: Includes $28 billion to buy and distribute COVID-19 vaccines efficiently and effectively and makes them available at no charge to any American who needs it.
  
 
WHAT ELSE?
 
You may be wondering about provisions included in the package that don't seem to have anything to do with COVID-19. The COVID-19 Relief Package passed as part of a larger appropriations package, which funds government programs through October 2021.
 
Here's a few wins I helped secure for the Central Coast in other parts of the bill: 
 
✔ Water Resources Development Act: This bill will help build and protect our water resources from the effects of climate change. One key piece will speed up the process for San Luis Obispo County to gain control of the Salinas Dam, to ensure residents have reliable access to clean water.
 
✔ Address Climate Change: The bill has been called ""the most significant climate change law in a decade."" It sets aside billions to promote renewable energy, including wind and solar, and reduces the use of ""HFCs"" -- a potent coolant in air conditioners and refrigerators that is a driver of global warming.
 
✔ Helps Veterans: The bill includes a measure I fought for that requires the VA to address the fact that Central Coast veterans' calls are being routed to Los Angeles instead of our local Community Based Outpatient Clinics. My hope is this will shorten wait times for veterans to get the care they need. 
  
 
WHAT'S NEXT?
 
Let me be perfectly clear: I know $600 doesn't go far enough for struggling Central Coast families. President Trump indicated he is open to a larger direct payment, which I have been advocating for since May. I stand ready to vote for more. 
 
As we enter the holiday season, keep in mind that the next few months will likely be the most difficult part of this pandemic. I know that more assistance for families, businesses, and local governments is crucial to our recovery, and I'll keep fighting to secure additional support in the new year. 
 
I know these are difficult times, but please do your part to curb the spread of the virus by wearing a mask, washing your hands, practicing social distancing, and stay home if you can. 
 
I wish you and your loved ones a safe, healthy, and happy holiday season.
  
Sincerely,

  
Congressman Salud Carbajal

For Immediate Release | Contact: Georgeanna Sullivan (202) 225-2956 

BLAINE’S BULLETIN: CHRISTMAS 2020
As we begin celebrating Christmas, I always like to reflect on the year behind us. In many ways 2020 was a year worth forgetting, but through it all we have seen extraordinary displays of generosity of spirit, sacrifice, kindness and grace. Communities rallied around their local businesses to help save their hometown favorites from having to close their doors and lay off workers. Teachers adapted to an entirely new way of teaching and went above and beyond to make sure each and every student had what they needed and didn’t fall behind. And the American medical community of doctors, nurses, first responders, hospital staff, scientists and vaccine trial volunteers did everything in their power to get our nation healthy in record time. America is truly the greatest country in the world, and the past year is a perfect example of how we rally around one other, especially when times get tough.
The Christmas season is one of hope, something this country needs a little extra dose of this year. Despite the frustrations and disappointments we have experienced, we do have plenty of reasons to be hopeful. Missouri is coming back fast, and vaccines have begun safeguarding our frontline medical workers and most vulnerable population. Small businesses are eligible for another round of PPP aid which means more families will be able to provide for their loved ones, and everyday we’re one step closer to every teacher and student returning to the classroom without fear.  
This is also the season of giving, and while it’s often easy to get caught up in the hustle and bustle of finding the perfect gifts, material presents seem a bit less important this year. With unemployment still too high and food banks not receiving their usual donations, giving to your favorite charity will likely be the most important gift you can give this year. While Jackie and I may be guilty of focusing a little too much on our grandchildren, our family also focuses on the teachings of Jesus and practice his lessons of giving to those in need. 
This Christmas will likely look a little different for some of us without the usual parties, parades, visits with Santa Claus or big festive church services. But following a year like we’ve had, I think this could be the perfect time to spend time with family, count our blessings, and look forward to next year. Thanks to the genius of our medical community and the courage of our workers, life as we know it should be returning to normal soon. This Christmas is a great opportunity to hold loved ones dear and remember what we’re thankful for. This year I am especially thankful for family, health and the ability to continue serving you in Congress. On behalf of my family, I wish you a safe, happy, healthy and Merry Christmas!

1/29/21 16:46,Keeping you updated,"Dear Friend,

This past week I’ve been working in the district. During my time at home I’ve been reflecting on how grateful I am to serve our district – and how excited I am for the term ahead. This week was filled with a lot of updates, like getting my district office up and running and receiving my committee assignments. I am looking forward to getting back to DC to start working on my new committees. 

I’ll be using this newsletter as a way to keep you up to date on my work on behalf of our Orange County community, so make sure you sign up for regular updates. You can also connect with my official Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages, where I’ll be posting the latest news and updates. 

Serving California's 48th District




Open for Business
My Huntington Beach office officially opened this week and is ready to serve you. The mission of my district office is to serve our community, and be fully accessible even when I’m in Washington, D.C. My staff here are also well equipped to process casework requests – so if you’re having difficulties with the IRS or another Federal Agency, this office is the best place for you to contact. I am looking forward to welcoming constituents from across the district into this office. Contact us here.

Your Voice in DC 




This week I received my committee assignments for the 117th Congress. I will be serving on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure as well as the Committee on Education and Labor. These assignments will allow me to work on important issues for our Orange County community, like protecting our coastline, reducing noise pollution, advancing school choice, and expanding workforce development. These new assignments are a great opportunity to support Orange County families and workers, and I won’t let you down.  

I joined my congressional colleagues in a letter to Allison Herren Lee, Acting Chairwoman of the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking answers into the anti-competitive practices and consumer trading restrictions seen this week by hedge funds and financial trading apps following the surge of stocks like GameStop ($GME). Earlier this week, investors – through trading apps such as Robinhood – bought shares in companies including GameStop, following publicly available news that investors had been short selling the stocks. The stock prices surged, and following pressure from Wall Street, the apps froze the traders’ ability to continue buying on the platform. Read the letter here. 

COVID-19 Updates 

Vaccines
I’ve received many calls from constituents over the past week with concerns about the vaccination process in Orange County. Per state guidelines, Orange County is taking a phased approach to vaccine distribution and aiming to reach the most vulnerable populations first. If you are a healthcare worker, 65 and older, or a law enforcement officer working in a high-risk setting, you can make an appointment here. 

If you are not in one of these categories, vaccines are not yet available in Orange County. The county is coordinating at the state and federal levels to get vaccines distributed as efficiently as possible to all who want one. It is important to continue taking proper COVID-19 safety precautions. For more information on vaccine distribution in Orange County, click here.  

Small Businesses 
The U.S. Small Business Administration, in consultation with the U.S. Treasury Department has reopened the Paycheck Protection Program loan portal for first- and second-time borrowers. If you’re a small business owner, check out the SBA’s website for the most up to date resources and guidance.

Economic Impact Payments 
The Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 includes a second round of Economic Impact Payments for qualified individuals making up to $75,000 per year. 

The second round of payments, or “EIP 2,” is generally $600 for singles and $1,200 for married couples filing a joint return. Most of these payments will be made by direct deposit. For those who are eligible for a second EIP and haven’t yet received a direct deposit, watch your mail for either a paper check or a debit card.

Working to Combat the Opioid Epidemic
 
This week, Reps. McKinley, Abigail Spanberger (D-VA-07), and David Trone (D-MD-06) led a bipartisan effort calling on the U.S. Treasury Department to allow states to use American Rescue Plan funding to combat increases in drug overdose deaths witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
In 2020, drug overdose deaths reached record levels in communities across the country. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drug overdose deaths in the United States are projected to have increased by 30 percent from 2019 to 2020 — and these cases rose dramatically as COVID-19 began spreading throughout American communities in the spring of 2020.
 
In response to this crisis, the bipartisan group of House Members pressed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to ensure that upcoming guidance will give states the flexibility they need to use American Rescue Plan funding to invest in prevention, treatment, and recovery efforts related to the growing substance abuse epidemic. In their letter, they also urged the Treasury Department to recognize the clear, direct link between the sharp spike in drug overdose deaths and the healthcare, economic, and psychological effects of the pandemic.
 
“The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) estimates there were more than 90,000 overdose deaths in the 12-month period ending in September 2020,” said Spanberger, McKinley, Trone, and their colleagues. “This would be a record high and represent a nearly 30% increase over the previous 12-month period’s death toll. Most of these deaths were caused by synthetic opioids like fentanyl. The NVSS projects that nearly every state in the country will suffer an increase in overdose deaths. In Virginia alone, overdose deaths are projected to have increased by more than 40% during the most recent 12-month period.”
 
Their letter continued, “Last year’s unprecedented escalation of the opioid crisis is almost certainly linked to the COVID-19 pandemic, and Treasury should make clear in its upcoming guidance to state and local governments that fighting the addiction crisis is an acceptable use of awards from the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Fund as was intended by Congress when it passed the American Rescue Plan. Treasury should allow states, tribes, and territories to use American Rescue Plan awards to provide supplemental funding to their mental and behavioral health authorities, and work with localities to identify creative ways to support their own responses to the overdose crisis.”
 
The U.S. Treasury Department is tasked with providing additional guidance to state governments about acceptable uses of American Rescue Plan funds — consistent with congressional intent.
 
The bipartisan letter was also signed by U.S. Representatives Susan Wild (D-PA-07), Alex X. Mooney (R-WV-02), Madeleine Dean (D-PA-04), and David N. Cicilline (D-RI-01).

House VA Committee Passes out McKinley Bill
 
This week the House Veteran Affairs committee passed out several bipartisan bills including the Veterans Camera Reporting (VCR) Act, that Rep. McKinley introduced back in March.

We must ensure that what happened at the Clarksburg VA Medical Center never happens again.

Dear Neighbor,  
Last week, Congress continued our work on COVID-19 relief legislation. President Biden’s American Rescue Plan is on track to be finalized and hopefully pass in the weeks ahead. As people continue to struggle from this unprecedented pandemic, I will continue to fight to get direct payments to each person and invest in the equitable distribution of vaccines. 
 
This past Saturday was a sad day in our country. The Senate had an opportunity to hold our former president accountable for his role in trying to stop democracy and inciting and encouraging the U.S. Capitol riots on January 6th. Several weeks ago, I voted in favor of impeachment because I believe that no one is above the law. Unfortunately, on Saturday a number of Republican senators ignored the facts, the evidence, and their constitutional duty when they put one man above their solemn oath to defend and protect the Constitution.
 
Even though the impeachment vote fell short, I am grateful for the Senators that were willing to put their oath first to deliver the largest bipartisan vote for presidential conviction in history. I also applaud the amazing work by the House Impeachment managers who laid our such a compelling case. Lastly, I continue to thank Capitol Hill police officers their heroism on that dreadful January 6th day. They deserve the Congressional Medal of Honor.
 
In this newsletter, you will find new information about vaccines, opportunities for free internet access, our upcoming events, and legislative updates.
  
 
Vaccine Updates and Information
 
  

Vaccine appointments are available for those who qualify. Continue to check the website or call 833-540-0473 between 8 am & 8:30 pm to book an appointment, but supply is still limited. You may have to try a few times to get an appointment. CVS Health is also providing limited vaccination appointments, and you can sign up here.
 
Remember: the L.A. County sites (Pomona Fairplex, The Forum, Cal State Northridge, Six Flax Magic Mountain, and the Downey Education Building) and the city-run sites like Dodger Stadium can sometimes operate under different rules.
 
  
 
More Vaccine Sites in our Community
 
Thousands of appointments suddenly became available this week. Please continue to check the site frequently and let your friends, family, and neighbors know when you see openings.
 
Dignity Health has announced that COVID-19 Vaccinations are available in Carson by appointment until February 19th. Appointments here.
 
The Biden Administration announced this week it plans to send doses of COVID vaccine directly to community health centers, something I’ve been pushing for in order to ensure a more equitable distribution.
 

  
It’s important to have enough vaccines at these sites in the communities that are most impacted. Both AltaMed and JWCH have locations in the district and have been approved for vaccines. If you are eligible for a vaccine, please contact these sites and inquire about appointments. I’m still concerned about the equity in the vaccine rollout, and will continue to push to get more doses into our communities.
 
What to bring to a Vaccine Appointment
 
If you’re eligible for the vaccine and are able to secure an appointment, make sure you bring the appropriate documents to your appointment. Those 65+ must bring proof of age and proof of residency.  The full list of required documents for vaccinations through L.A. County can be found here. If you’re being vaccinated through a site run by a different entity, please make sure you confirm what documents you are required to bring.
 
Long Beach Vaccinations

COVID-19 Updates
 
  
California continues to see improvement in the fight against COVID-19. Hospitalizations are down 34 percent in the last two weeks and ICU admissions are also down 24 percent. Daily case numbers and test positivity rates have also been drastically cut. All of this was achieved thanks to your efforts to stay home and wear your mask. By continuing to do so, you’re continuing to save lives! 
  

 
We are still seeing troubling signs as a new COVID strain from the UK spreads across the nation. This new strain is more infectious and public health experts advise that you “double-mask” (wear one mask on top of the other) when you go out in public. 1 in 10 Californians have now been vaccinated and the situation should improve as this number goes up. Until then, please keep up your efforts to stay safe and save lives.

	•	Aid to local and state governments facing deficits from the economic downturn. 
	•	Inclusive aid for all people and communities, regardless of immigration status. 
	•	Survival checks to families for the duration of the pandemic, and a fully refundable child tax credit of $3,000 to $3,600. 
In addition, I recently signed onto a letter to protect the income-eligibility requirements for survival checks that were in previous relief bills, rather than lower the amount and make it harder to be eligible.

4/23/21 20:52,  Message from Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández,"Dear Friends, It has been another exciting and busy week! On Tuesday, I had the honor of joining Congressional Hispanic Caucus leadership members to meet President Biden and Vice President Harris to talk about the issues of greatest impact to Latino communities. We discussed the steps the administration can take to ensure that our communities across the country have equitable access to COVID relief and see the benefits of future investments in our nation’s housing, infrastructure, business development, education, and more. You can read more about my meeting with President Biden HERE. 
 
I also had the opportunity to greet First Lady Dr. Jill Biden as she arrived in Albuquerque on Wednesday. I’m thankful that she took the time to visit our state and witness New Mexico’s nation-leading vaccine program and our education needs in Indian Country.  Investing in education is one way our country will build back better! 
Working for New Mexico
This week I signed a letter to the Biden Administration with other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus advocating for a comprehensive, permanent federal paid family and medical leave policy. The pandemic has emphasized the urgent need for a bold policy to address the health and economic inequities that affect our communities. 
 
As Chair of the Subcommittee on Indigenous Peoples, I chaired a hearing Wednesday titled Infrastructure in Indigenous Communities: Priorities for the American Jobs Plan. The testimony was heartbreaking to hear because it painted the picture of federal neglect of our obligations from dilapidated and impassable roads, to health clinics not built, to homes without running water, electricity, let along broadband. The hearing was meant to what Congress and this Administration could do to address those infrastructure inequities as its trust responsibility requires. I also joined my colleagues in the House to pass:  
	•	The Access to Counsel Act to ensure that our nation treats those arriving at our borders with dignity and respect. This legislation would provide U.S. citizens and others with lawful status an opportunity to access counsel when they are detained for more than an hour at ports of entry, including airports. 
	•	The Washington, D.C. Admission Act to enfranchise 700,000 American citizens. Washington D.C. residents pay taxes, serve our nation in uniform, and overwhelmingly support statehood.This legislation makes our country a more perfect union and provides full representation in our democracy.

For Immediate Release | Contact: Georgeanna Sullivan (202) 225-2956 

BLAINE'S BULLETIN: COVID-19 VACCINE
We don’t often think of Polio anymore because no new cases have been diagnosed in the U.S. since 1979 – thanks to a vaccine. Researchers started work on the Polio vaccine in the 1930’s, but it wasn’t until 1954 that children began receiving it in the United States. A safe and effective measles vaccine took ten years to develop. And the influenza virus began affecting Americans in the 1930’s, while a vaccine wasn’t ready for human use until 1945. We are fortunate to live in a country with great medical minds who over the years figured out how to eradicate many deadly illnesses with vaccines, but they weren’t developed overnight. 
This week, Americans began receiving the FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine less than a year after development in the U.S. began. Thanks to the incredible doctors, scientists, volunteers who took part in the trials, private sector partners, and Operation Warp Speed, a feat that historically takes decades happened in just a matter of months. In fact, this is the fastest vaccine ever produced for a novel pathogen. It is yet another testament to the ingenuity and humanity we have seen from America throughout the pandemic. 
As of last spring, scientists were anticipating the vaccine to be delivered within a year and a half. Some went as far as to say it is unrealistic to expect a vaccine in 2020.  But here we are in December and first responders and America’s most vulnerable populations are already receiving it with millions of more doses on the way. Pfizer, whose facility here in Missouri helped develop the vaccine, has led the charge getting the first FDA-approved vaccine out to the American public. They have produced and distributed 100 million initial doses and have hundreds of millions more coming. And Moderna should have their approval from the FDA any minute, making millions more doses available those who want it.  
Missouri is distributing the vaccine in three phases which have already begun. Phase 1 includes health care workers, first responders, essential workers and long-term care residents and staff. Phase 2 will include populations at increased risk and Phase 3 will be open to all Missouri residents. Our state is committed to providing this vaccine at a very low or no cost at all to Missourians who want to be vaccinated. For information on where and when a vaccine will be available to you, Missouri has created an entire website dedicated to vaccine updates at covidvaccine.mo.gov. 
The development of this vaccine should be the last piece of the puzzle in helping restore our way of life and allowing everyone, even the at-risk population, to get back to living without fear of the virus. While many of us have tried our best to continue life as usual, the last year has been frightening and stressful for our most vulnerable populations. Now that we have a vaccine becoming available for those who want to receive it, Missourians can breathe a sigh of relief and get back to work, school and supporting the small businesses who have continued to struggle. Small businesses across the U.S. have been crippled by response to the pandemic – often times unnecessarily. With light at the end of tunnel, I can’t wait to put this pandemic behind us and see our local economies booming again.   
CONTACT US: As always, for those of you with Internet access, I encourage you to visit my official website. For those without access to the Internet, I encourage you to call my offices in Jefferson City (573-635-7232) Washington, Mo.

District Swearing In Ceremony
 
It is the honor of a lifetime to serve as your representative in Congress. On January 28th, I had the pleasure of reaffirming my oath to the Constitution and to the constituents of Texas’ 11th District before God, family, and the kind, honest, hard-working people that make our West Texas region so special.




Congressman Pfluger, joined by wife Camille, is sworn in by U.S. District Judge David Counts during a ceremony at the U.S. Courthouse in Midland on January 28th, 2021

I do not take this oath lightly. As a seventh-generation Texan born and raised in this District in a family whose livelihoods depended on agriculture and oil and gas, I understand that the policies coming out of Washington are more than just economics and industries—they are personal.

As I have said many times, the 11th District of Texas is special. It is a critical intersection of national security for our country. Home to the largest oil and gas producing region in the Nation, over 15 million acres of farm and ranch land, multiple premiere universities—both public and private—and a world-class Air Force Base that trains service members from every branch of our military in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, as well as specialized firefighting techniques. Our district also plays a key role in border security and many other critical operations. 

But more than contributing Energy, Agriculture, and National Security, our District is made up of some of the best people in the world who truly care for their neighbor, community, and country. I have my work cut out for me going up against policies in Washington that seek to undercut conservative values and overblow the scope of federal government control, but I pledge to continue standing up for Texas values and for the people and livelihoods here at home.

Read on to see the work I have been doing for you in Congress:

Appointed to Two Major National Security Committees
 
I am honored and excited to represent the 11th District of Texas on two fantastic committees tasked with defending the security of our nation at home and abroad—the House Committee on Homeland Security and House Foreign Affairs Committee. I have also been appointed as the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Intelligence and Counterterrorism on the Homeland Security Committee. 

The most important role of the federal government is to protect our citizens from national security threats. Both of these committees will allow our district to have a seat at the table regarding immigration and border security, counterterrorism, cyber security, energy, and international trade, and advancing America’s position against global threats like China, Russia, Iran and other rogue actors. 

I look forward to working with my colleagues on these committees to ensure the United States remains the safest, most prosperous nation in the world. Click here to read more. 

Leading the Texas Ag Task Force

Last week, I was announced as a co-leader of the Texas Ag Task Force, which will promote and champion federal policies in Congress that strengthen Texas agriculture and rural communities.

The 11th District has over 15 million acres of farm and ranch land worked by diligent producers who provide not only this district, but the entire Nation, with the food and fiber we need to survive. I am excited to lead this task force with several of my colleagues and ensure that Texans present a strong, united voice as we advocate for the hundreds of thousands of hard-working farmers and ranchers in the Lone Star State.

Read more here. 


Supporting Meaningful Legislation

Over these last few weeks, I supported numerous bills that further the best interests of the 11th District and our entire nation.

Conservation Funding Protection Act
Sponsored by Dan Crenshaw (TX-2)
This legislation ensures that oil producers will retain access to critical energy reservoirs on the Outer Continental Shelf by addressing President Biden’s harmful executive order that jeopardizes our critical energy production.

Restricting Federal Funding to Organizations Associated with the Abortion Industry
Sponsored by Rep. Virginia Foxx (NC-5)
This bill works to prohibit taxpayer dollars from funding abortions or entities that provide abortions.

Authorizing the Keystone XL Pipeline
Sponsored by Rep. Kelly Armstrong (ND-00)
This bill authorizes the construction and operation of the Keystone XL Pipeline and declares that a Presidential permit is not required. 

Home in the 11th District

Last week, I had the honor of meeting some of the healthcare professionals, law enforcement agents, farmers, business owners, and community leaders who are making a huge impact in our district.  

Read some of my reflections on the good work being done in District 11 in my article in the Midland Reporter-Telegram. 


Angelo State University is a special asset to the Concho Valley. It was an honor to meet with ASU President Ronnie Hawkins Jr. in San Angelo. During the meeting, President Hawkins outlined the university’s plans to establish a Center of Excellence in Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence through a partnership with Goodfellow Air Force Base, the local community, and existing industry relationships.

It is impressive to see the continued enrollment growth of the student body and hear about the great work underway to educate the next generation of leaders in a variety of industries, including intelligence. I look forward to partnering with President Hawkins and the Ram Family to support their mission and work towards the good of the San Angelo Community.

Read more about my meeting with President Hawkins here. 



Meeting with officers stationed at the Border Patrol Station in San Angelo. These officers bolster our National security by operating unmanned aircraft over 850 miles of the border between Texas and Mexico.


Paying a visit to the students, faculty, and health professionals at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center Permian Basin, who are reaching across university lines to advance telemedicine access in rural communities in West Texas.



Visiting the COVID-19 vaccination site at the Midland County Horseshoe and meeting some of the healthcare volunteers from Midland College.


Meeting with business owners and community leaders at a meeting with the Midland Chamber of Commerce.


Touring farms and ranches in the 11th District with the Texas Farm Bureau. 

We Don’t Need Bailouts, We Need to Get Back to Work

I spoke on the House Floor for the first time in opposition to Budget Reconciliation, a partisan resolution that sets the stage to jam through President Biden’s COVID stimulus bill that will cost nearly $2 trillion, and includes a liberal wish list of provisions unrelated to the pandemic.

 Dear Friends,  The Biden administration recently announced its support for a proposal that would force American developers of COVID-19 vaccines to surrender their intellectual property rights to hostile foreign competitors, such as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Of course, the CCP routinely steals Americans’ intellectual property by way of cybercrime, industrial espionage, and forced technology transfers.  It’s hard to imagine a more self-defeating or unjust policy. Indeed, I recently penned an op-ed outlining why the Biden administration must reverse course and protect American developers’ intellectual property from Communist China, which you can read here. Additionally, today I asked U.S. Trade Ambassador Katherine Tai if President Biden will protect American technology from being willingly surrendered to the CCP and other belligerent foreign governments, which you can watch here.  Sincerely,     Devin Nunes Member of Congress  Pleases note that this account does not accept incoming messages.

4/18/21 9:28,  Sixth District Perspectives with Congressman Ben Cline,"News From Congressman Ben Cline
 
 
 
 
 
 
Sixth District Perspectives with Congressman Ben Cline 
     Following a productive District Work Period where I met with constituents and toured a number of businesses, the House gaveled back into session on Tuesday. I continue to monitor the crisis on our southern border and in a subcommittee hearing this week, I questioned HHS Secretary Becerra about the Administration's lack of a plan to address the worsening crisis. Additionally, the Majority introduced a reckless bill to add four Justices to the Supreme Court, which should be of grave concern to all Americans. However, in a moment of bipartisanship, fellow members of the Problem Solvers Caucus and I wrote to House Leadership urging an end to the practice of going around congressional rules to pass legislation. Further, the House passed a number of bipartisan bills to aid small businesses that are struggling. While it was a busy week, I always appreciate the opportunity to advocate for those I am honored to represent here in Washington. 
Trivium Packaging: 
     Trivium Packaging has facilities all over the world, including a manufacturing plant in Roanoke, which employs 125 area residents. This company delivers innovative and sustainable metal packaging to help leading brands protect their products and stand out. And since the COVID-19 pandemic began, Trivium has been essential in ensuring our shelves remain stocked by supplying packaging to America’s food and beverage industries. This week, before my return to Washington, I enjoyed the opportunity to tour the plant and see their innovative work firsthand, as well as hear from management and staff about how Congress can help them continue to grow.  
 
Disorder at the Border: 
     This week, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) released new data regarding the crisis at our border. Last month alone, more than 170,000 migrants illegally crossed our border, which is a 400 percent increase from March of last year and a 71 percent increase from February. This now means more than 350,000 migrants have tried to cross the border in 2021. Further, there are double the record number of unaccompanied minors in custody, which currently stands at 20,000+ between CBP and HHS holding facilities. To make matters worse, the President's $1.52 trillion budget proposal includes a zero percent funding increase for the Department of Homeland Security to help CBP do their jobs effectively. Finally, the President has tasked Vice-President Harris as the de facto ""Border Czar,"" yet she has yet to visit our border to see the crisis firsthand. This Administration must address this worsening humanitarian and economic crisis. 
 
Protecting Life: 
     A baby born alive, even after an attempted abortion, should be afforded the same constitutional protections as every other American. That's why, this week, I joined my GOP colleagues in signing a discharge petition to force a vote on the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. This legislation would require health care practitioners who are present at the live birth of a child following a failed abortion to exercise skill, care, and diligence to preserve the life and health of the baby—the same degree of care that would be offered to any other child born prematurely of the same gestational age. After those efforts, the health care workers must transport and admit the child to a hospital. Further, it requires health care practitioners and hospital employees to report violations to law enforcement authorities, thus reducing the number of born-alive abortions that go unreported. It also penalizes the intentional killing of a born-alive child by a physician through fines or up to 5 years imprisonment. Protecting living and breathing babies outside of the womb should not be a partisan issue. However, since Speaker Pelosi has refused to call this bill for a vote, I am hopeful that the discharge petition will garner the 218 signatures necessary to trigger an immediate vote on the House Floor.
 
Regular Order: 
     With narrow majorities in the House and Senate, we need bipartisan support and solutions to get bills passed in both houses and ultimately signed into law by the President. The best way to do this is by having a deliberative and open process that promotes transparency and allows members to help shape legislation through committee hearings, markups, and Floor amendments. Unfortunately, with a majority of only six seats, Speaker Pelosi has been rushing bills to the Floor, bypassing committees, and limiting amendments. This is not how the legislative process should work, and I recently joined my colleagues in the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus in writing to House leadership urging a return to regular order. Doing so will make for a higher functioning representative government that truly works for the American people. To read the letter, click here.  
Court Packing: 
     This week, President Biden launched a commission to study expanding the Supreme Court and House Judiciary Chairman Jerry Nadler introduced legislation to increase the number of Justices from 9 to 13. This is ridiculous and packing the Supreme Court simply because one party doesn't like the current makeup or is seeking revenge for past appointments is as reckless as it gets. This would set a wildly dangerous precedent and be detrimental to the American Justice System. Democrats are showing their willingness to dismantle our institutions simply to consolidate power. Throughout modern history, the idea of packing the court has been viewed as nonsensical even by prominent members of the Democrat Party and the High Court's most liberal Justices. Hopefully, the House Majority will listen to the words of those that came before them.
	•	When President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose portrait is prominently displayed above the fireplace in President Biden’s Oval Office, attempted to pack the Supreme Court to push his political agenda, Democrats in 1937 argued this plan should be so “emphatically rejected that its parallel will never again be presented”.
	•	Then-Senator Joe Biden warned in 1983 that court packing could “put in question, if for an entire decade, the independence of the most significant body...in this country, the Supreme Court of the United States of America.”
	•	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said: “There are some people on the Democratic side who would like to increase the number of judges. I think that was a bad idea…if anything would make the court appear partisan.”
	•	Justice Steven Breyer said recently: “Structural alteration [to the Court] motivated by the perception of political influence can only feed that perception, further eroding that trust.”
Fighting for Small Businesses: 
     This week, I was pleased that the House considered a number of pieces of legislation to aid small businesses. Far too many mom and pop shops have been forced to close their doors this past year, and Congress continues to work to assist those in need. I am hopeful that the legislation listed below, all of which I voted in favor of and passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support, will serve as lifelines to the small business community and help them keep their doors open as many still face hardship caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
	•	H.R. 1502 - Microloan Improvement Act of 2021       H.R. 1502 builds on the strengths of the Microloan Program by introducing flexibility and more features for small dollar borrowers to utilize as they move through the Microloan lending process. 
	•	H.R. 1487 - Microloan Transparency and Accountability Act of 2021      H.R 1487 requires the SBA to perform an annual portfolio risk analysis of the Microloan Program to examine defaults and charge off rates to ensure taxpayer money is safeguarded. 
	•	H.R. 1490 - 504 Modernization and Small Manufacturer Enhancement Act of 2021      H.R. 1490 modernizes the 504/CDC (Certified Development Company) Loan Program and enhances how the program assists small manufacturers by increasing the loan amount and resource availability. The legislation also streamlines the complicated 504 Loan Program closing process for small businesses.
	•	H.R. 1482 - 504 Credit Risk Management Improvement Act of 2021           The 504 Credit Risk Management Improvement Act strengthens the oversight capabilities of the SBA as it pertains to the 504 Loan Program.
Congressional Art Competition: 
     This week, my office announced its participation in the 2021 Congressional Art Competition. The Congressional Art Competition is sponsored by the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives and is an opportunity to recognize and encourage the artistic talent in the Sixth Congressional District of Virginia. The competition is open to all high school students in the District and the winning artwork will be displayed for one year in the U.S. Capitol alongside other pieces from across the country. For more information including rules, deadlines, and submission requirements, visit my website here. Emily McClung of Lexington was the Sixth District’s 2020 winner, and her painting ""Lemonade,"" featured below, currently hangs in the U.S. Capitol. 
 
COVID-19 Update: 
    As of April 17, 2021, Virginia has had 644,828 total cases of COVID-19, including confirmed lab tests and clinical diagnoses, according to the Virginia Department of Health. The current death toll in the Commonwealth stands at 10,564. Further, according to the VDH's COVID-19 vaccine data dashboard, as of April 17th, 3,345,853 people have been vaccinated with at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, and 2,059,882 people are fully vaccinated.

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCXCI

Monday, November 30, 2020:  After our daily all-staff conference call this morning, I head to America’s Second Harvest of Coastal Georgia in Savannah where I meet with CEO Mary Jane Crouch, one of the most enthusiastic people I know who loves her job and truly cares about helping people. 

Rep. Carter visits America’s Second Harvest of Coastal Georgia
After discussing legislative priorities, Mary Jane leads me on a tour of the facility including the kitchen where a host of great volunteers are preparing meals that can be heated for children as well as their new giant refrigerated storage building.  After a great visit, I head to Jesup in Wayne County where I attend the funeral of one of the most beloved citizens in the area, Mr. William “Billie” Clanton.  For the past 12 years, Billie has hosted the “Day for Wayne” at his river house in Odum, an event highlighting the beauty and diversity of Wayne County that draws public officials and guests from across the state of Georgia.  Billie and his wife of 55 years, Nell, have 5 daughters, 16 grandchildren, 7 great grandchildren and 2 more on the way. 

Rep. Carter with Mr. William “Billie” Clanton
Billie passed on November 27 and the funereal is today which is also his birthday.  I have to admit this is the first funeral I have ever attended where we sang Happy Birthday to the deceased.  However, anyone who knew Billie knows that he wouldn’t want it any other way.  Afterwards, I head back to Pooler and during the drive I have a conference call with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Andy Wheeler, to discuss Aircraft CO2 standards that are set to be finalized this year.  Andy Wheeler has done an outstanding job as Administrator of the EPA and has been a great help to us in the coastal areas.  Once back in Pooler, I have a Whip Team conference call where we discuss the schedule and agenda items for this week.

Tuesday, December 1, 2020:   I’m headed to Memorial Stadium in Savannah this morning as I volunteer at the America’s Second Harvest of Coastal Georgia drive-thru food distribution event.  Along with members of the Georgia Army National Guard and other volunteers, we load boxes full of food into the trunks of vehicles as they drive through.  Although the weather is cold outside, the warm feeling one gets from helping your neighbor certainly keeps you going. 

Rep. Carter volunteers at the America’s Second Harvest of Coastal Georgia drive-thru food distribution event
Afterwards, I head to St. Simons Island in Glynn County and during the drive I have a GOP member conference committee call where we discuss this week’s schedule and other items.  Once in Glynn County, I attend the St. Simons Island Rotary Club’s weekly meeting and afterwards I call into the Fox Across America radio show with Jimmy Failla where I have a live interview to discuss a number of topics including the upcoming Senatorial runoff elections in Georgia.  A link to my interview can be found here.  Next, I head to the Unified Command headquarters at Morningstar Marina in Glynn County where I meet with Coast Guard and other officials for a briefing on the salvaging of the Golden Ray. 

Rep. Carter meets with the Unified Command
The first of seven planned cuts to the capsized ship has been made and, unfortunately, has taken much longer than anticipated with a number of unforeseen problems.  While work continues, the progress at this point is disappointing.  Afterwards, I meet with Capt. Bruce Fendig with the Brunswick bar pilots to discuss issues with the Port that are unrelated to the Golden Ray operation.  Next, I head back to Pooler and during the drive I join in on a virtual Values Action Team (VAT) Coalition meeting where we discuss a number of issues that we will be addressing during the upcoming session. 

Wednesday, December 2, 2020:  After an early morning flight to Washington this morning, I’m at the Capitol and my first meeting is with a representative from Fresenius Medical Care, a company that provides services for people living with chronic kidney disease and related conditions.  Next, I head to the Cannon Rotunda where I have a live interview on Fox Business to discuss the COVID-19 vaccine and upcoming Georgia Senatorial runoffs.  A link to my interview can be found here. 

Rep. Carter appears on Fox Business
After joining in on our daily all-staff conference call, I head to the House Chamber where I pay tribute to my good friend, Truitt Eavenson, who recently retired from Georgia Power after a long and productive career.  A link to my tribute can be found here.  Afterwards, I head back to my office where I have a phone interview with Dave Catanese with McClatchy to discuss the President and Vice-President's planned visits to Georgia this weekend to campaign for the Republican candidates in the Senatorial runoffs.  Immediately afterwards, I have another phone interview, this time with New York Magazine, to discuss the same subject matter.  Later, I attend retirement receptions for two of my good friends who I will miss greatly, Rep. Bradley Byrnes (R-AL) and Rep. Rob Bishop (R-NV) before heading to the House Chamber for our first vote session of the week.

Thursday, December 3, 2020:  After our daily all-staff conference call, I head to the Congressional Visitors Center (CVC) for a GOP Conference where we ratify the 117th Congress ranking members.  Ranking members are the most senior member of a committee from the minority party.  Although our party made great gains in the House of Representatives this last election, we will still be in the minority next year.  Once back in my office, I join in on an Aspen Institute virtual breakfast discussion where we hear from former Utah Governor and Ambassador to Russia, China and Singapore, Jon Huntsman, who leads us in a great discussion on U.S. policy toward Russia and China. Next, I join in on a Doctor’s Caucus telebriefing with Health and Human Services (HHS) Deputy Secretary David Hargan as we discuss Stark Law and anti-kickback regulations.  Afterwards, I head to the House Chamber for the swearing in ceremony of Rep. Kwanza Hall, who will be completing the term of Rep. John Lewis in the 5th District. 

Rep. Carter honors William “Billie” Clanton
Staying in the House Chamber, I pay tribute to William “Billie” Clanton of Wayne County who passed last week. A link to my tribute can be found here.  Once back in my office, I have a virtual call with Medical Transportation Access Coalition to discuss my Non-Emergency Medical Transport legislation followed by a virtual call with the Bryan County Chamber of Commerce (COC) where I am honored to be their guest speaker this week on their Grits and Government series.  Next, I have a phone conference with fellow Energy and Commerce (E&C) members as we welcome our new ranking member, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA), and discuss upcoming priorities.  Afterwards, I have a virtual interview with Nexstar (WSAV-TV) to discuss the upcoming Georgia Senatorial runoffs before heading to the Rayburn meeting room adjacent to the House Chamber where I film this week’s edition of Buddy’s Briefing.

Hello,  Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them. 
  
Hosting the VA Secretary in Kansas 
Beginning at the Dwight D. Eisenhower VA Medical Center in Leavenworth 
As the lead Republican on Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I hosted VA Secretary Denis McDonough in Kansas for two days last week to meet with veterans and VA leaders across the state. On Thursday morning, we started at the Dwight D. Eisenhower Leavenworth VA Medical Center to tour the facility, visit with patients and employees, and talk with veterans and members of VSOs.
  
 
  
On the tour, we viewed the emergency and surgical areas and walked through the Women’s Health Center. This clinic provides a dedicated space for the fastest-growing group of veterans to schedule and receive care and has also served as a meeting point for women veterans to gather and support one another.  At the conclusion of the tour, we hosted a roundtable where we discussed the delivery of care to veterans by the VA Eastern Kansas Healthcare System as well as some of the challenges facing veterans in rural parts of the state. I emphasized my commitment that veterans have access to quality care and the Secretary committed to looking at new ways the VA can improve billing processes and better provide timely care to veterans in rural areas and those facing mental health challenges.  Thank you to Congressman Jake LaTurner, Kansas Rep. Pat Proctor of Leavenworth, Col. (Ret.) Lynn Rolf Jr. of the Kansas Veterans of Foreign Wars of Leavenworth, Kansas American Legion National Executive Committeeman Dan Wiley of Leavenworth, American Legion Kansas Department Commander Marri Krupco of Blue Mound, Daniel Brazzel of Team Fidelis of Overland Park and County Coordinator Kathy Shepard of Independence for joining the discussion.  It was an honor to join the Secretary for a commemorative coin presentation ceremony recognizing VA medical center staff for their exemplary service during the pandemic. Coins were awarded to CBOC Manager Jackie Garcia, VA Police Officer Derek Ursuy, Amanda Krauss, RN, Kerry McDowell, LPN, and Dr. Courtney Hahn, and I appreciated the opportunity to thank them in person for caring for Kansas veterans. Thank you also to Director Rudy Klopfer for the tour and to Dr. William Patterson, Damian Mcgee and Joseph Burks for their time. 
  
 
  
Discussing the SAVE LIVES Act at the Colmery-O’Neil VA Medical Center  Following Leavenworth, Secretary McDonough accompanied me to Topeka, where we visited the Colmery-O’Neil Topeka VA Medical Center.  During our tour of the facility, we discussed the successful vaccine rollout and learned more about the outpatient care the center provides. Several weeks ago during my visit here, I learned of a reluctance from veterans to be vaccinated through the VA if their spouses were not eligible. Because of this, I introduced legislation – the SAVE LIVES Act – to allow veteran spouses and caregivers to be eligible for vaccines through the VA, and it was quickly signed into law. I’m pleased to announce that over the last two weeks, 18,000 individuals have been vaccinated under the new law, including 1,625 in the VISN 15 Heartland region. I also expressed my gratitude to the Colmery-O’Neil medical staff for their tireless work to care for veterans throughout this pandemic and appreciate that they are setting an example for their communities – 85% of VISN employees are receiving the vaccine. Additionally, we presented recognition coins to the staff that cares for Kansas veterans for their dedicated service during the pandemic: Hilton McLamb, Dane O’Hara, Michelle Ralston, Mindy Mulford and Colon Colbert.   I want to thank Director Rudy Klopfer for the tour and Dr. Thomas Klobucar and Dr. William Patterson for joining us. Thank you also to VAEK’s Associate Director Lisa Curnes, Chief of Staff Dr. Michael Lesson, Assistant Director Alfred J. Mooney, Dr. Stephanie Davis, Dr. TJ McCombs, Heather Jones, Ruby Wood and Joe Burks for their time. 
  
 
  
Visiting the Lieutenant General Richard J. Seitz Community Based Outpatient Clinic  After Topeka, Secretary McDonough visited the Lieutenant General Richard J. Seitz Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) in Junction City, where he learned more about how this clinic is able to coordinate care for women veterans, even in instances where care would need to take place outside of the clinic. Currently, the clinic has been working hard to coordinate mental telehealth services as the pandemic has exacerbated the mental strain many veterans experience as a result of their service. This clinic also helps coordinate the HUD-VASH program for veterans in the area experiencing homelessness, especially homelessness caused by transition issues. 
  
Focusing on Community Care Options for Veterans in Emporia  On Friday morning Secretary McDonough and I stopped by Emporia’s Newman Regional Health Medical Center to meet with staff and patients. Newman has consistently been recognized as one of the most clinically capable facilities in Kansas, and I was pleased to showcase their care and services extend to Lyon, Chase, Coffey, Greenwood, Morris, Osage and Wabaunsee counties to provide top-notch care for much of east-central Kansas.  The medical staff at Newman brought the secretary and me up to speed on how their community hospital has filled in the health care gap since the closure of the VA Eastern Kansas HCS Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC). We also had a chance to discuss the MISSION Act, legislation that allows the VA to establish a more highly integrated health care network, including providing greater access to community care programs and telemedicine services, as well as providing much-needed support to rural community hospitals. During our conversation, Dr. Heitman shared with Secretary McDonough and me the difficulties veterans face in the authorization process as they schedule needed procedures and his desire to care for his veteran patients though these hurdles. Secretary McDonough shared his thanks for providing feedback that will help the veteran community at large.  I want to extend my thanks to Newman CEO Bob Wright, CFO Holly French, COO Julia Pyle, Dr. Bryce Heitman, Supervisor of Care Coordination Lucas Markowitz, Board Trustee Rob Gilligan, Executive Assistant Lynn Redecker and Chief Quality Officer Cathy Pimple for their time. Thanks also to Congressman Tracey Mann, Eastern Kansas VA Director Rudy Klopfer, Eastern Kansas VA Community Care Director Brock Wedman and Kansas Hospital Association Vice President for Reimbursements Tish Hollingsworth for joining us. 
  
 
  
Visiting with Veterans at the Dole VAMC Community Living Center  On Friday afternoon, Secretary McDonough and I visited Wichita’s Robert J. Dole VA Medical Center and were pleased to have Congressman Ron Estes join us. I last visited the Dole VA facility just before Christmas as medical staff began to administer Dole VA’s first vaccines to the beginning of what would become many veterans. It was great to see the progress the facility has made in just a few short months as we continue to get back to normal.  During our tour of the facility, we discussed the wait times veterans are experiencing for compensation and pension exams, known as C&P exams, with the Veterans Benefits Administration Regional Office Director Ms. Donna Meyer-Hickel and my efforts to increase the National Personnel Records Center response times to fulfill veteran requests for records related to their service benefits. We also met with union representatives from the American Federation of Government Employees, including President Kip Chappell.  The highlight of the tour was when we visited the Community Living Center and met with veteran residents. They haven’t been able to have visitors throughout the past year due to the pandemic, so we were pleased to spend some time with them. Here, we also were able to present recognition coins to the staff that has cared for Kansas veterans throughout the pandemic: Nikki Lind, Vince Hodgdon, Jacklyn Bantam, Dr. Christopher Fox, Kimberly Gillette, Misty Lester, Curt Rodriguez, Clint Bass and Brandi Tolbert.  Thank you to Dole Director Candace Ifabiyi for leading the tour, and to Dr. Tom Klobucar and Dr. William Patterson for joining us as we heard more from Dole leadership and staff. 
  

  
Continuing the Legacy of Aviation Excellence at Wichita State University 
On Thursday afternoon, I was honored to attend the dedication of the Wichita State University’s (WSU) newest National Institute for Aviation Research (NIAR) lab, the Jerry Moran Center for Advanced Virtual Engineering and Testing. The new facility located in WSU’s innovation campus houses crash dynamics, virtual engineering, virtual flight testing and building blocks laboratory programs where students will learn and research.  I have worked closely with WSU’s NIAR Executive Director Dr. John Tomblin to bring federal officials and business leaders to campus so that they can recognize the amazing resources, faculty and students at WSU. Once leaders get on the campus, the university sells itself. Ultimately, WSU and its students are changing the world and preserving Wichita as the Air Capital of the World. While I was there, I was also pleased to announce a new grant from the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts program for $2 million that will go toward the study of a neutrino-detecting mission concept, or tools to better understand the inside of stars.  Thank you to the Kansas Board of Regents (KBOR) for this honor and Dr. Tomblin for his exceptional leadership of NIAR and his continued partnership as we work to grow WSU, Wichita, our state and our nation. I also want to thank interim President of WSU Richard Muma, KBOR Regent Jon Rolph and Spirit AeroSystems CEO Tom Gentile for their kind remarks during the ceremony. I also appreciated the attendance of KBOR President Blake Flanders and Regents Helen Van Etten and Mark Hutton. I extend my thanks to everyone who took time out of their day to attend the event.

Breaking Ground on the SEK Impact Center 
In February, I announced a $2.6 million CARES Act Recovery grant to Neosho Memorial Regional Medical Center (NMRMC) from the U.S. Economic Development Administration to fund a new Southeast Kansas Impact Center for Wellness, Education, and Business.  On Tuesday, I was pleased to join them as they broke ground on this project that will impact the community well into the future. Thank you to the individuals involved in this grant and for their initiative in undertaking this project that will have a big regional impact. The new facility will include conference space for the community, as well as a clinic and telehealth facility.  This event brought the community together, and I appreciated the remarks from NMRMC CEO Dennis Franks, NMRMC Foundation President Phil Jarred, Chanute Mayor Jacob LaRue, Neosho County Commission Chair Nic Galemore and Lt. Governor David Toland. Thank you to NMRMC for the invitation and their staff for all they do to care for their fellow Kansans. 
  
 
  
Stopping in Fort Scott for Labconco’s Vaccination Event 
While in southeast Kansas on Tuesday, I visited Labconco Corporation, a company that manufacturers laboratory equipment in Fort Scott, as the Community Health Center of Southeast Kansas (CHCSEK) administered the second vaccine dose to their employees. It was helpful to hear both from Labconco about their operation during the pandemic to produce lab hoods to help with COVID-19 testing, as well as receive an update from the CHCSEK about their successful vaccination clinics for local businesses and the general public.  Thank you to Labconco CEO Laura McConnell Perin and CHCSEK Director of Development Dawn McNay for helping coordinate my visit, as well as City Manager Jeremy Frazier and City Commissioners Kevin Allen and Dr. Randy Nichols for joining us. And thank you to the staff of the CHCSEK, including Lori Rexwhinkle, Kimberly Whitaker, Jeannie Napier and Stephanie Potter, for the update and all the work they are doing to get more vaccine shots in the arms of Kansans. 
  
 
  
Thanking Health Care Workers at Pittsburg’s Hospital 
I also visited Ascension Via Christi Hospital in Pittsburg to thank their health care workers for all they have done during the pandemic. They choose to care for others every day and truly make a difference in the Pittsburg and southeastern Kansas community. I also had the opportunity to speak with several Pitt State Nursing students and thank them for choosing a profession where they put others first. 
  
 
  
While at the Hospital I met with CEO Drew Talbott, Chief Nursing Officer Tawny Sandifer and ER Department Chief and Crawford County Health Officer Dr. Tim Stebbins to discuss their partnerships with the Community Healthcare Center of Southeast Kansas to serve surrounding rural areas. Access to health care is important for rural areas, and I appreciate their leadership in working towards a financially viable model to provide care to Kansans. Read more here. 
  
 
  
Congratulating Joseph Lee on Admission to the U.S. Naval Academy 
It was an honor to congratulate Joseph Lee on his acceptance into the U.S. Naval Academy while in Pittsburg. We are fortunate to have intelligent, hard-working, humble and patriotic students like Joseph in our country who are willing to serve at the highest level in our Armed Forces. I was pleased to nominate Joseph, and I know that the Pittsburg community and all of Kansas is very proud of you!  Read more about Joseph here in the Pittsburg Morning Sun by clicking here. 
  
 
  
Visiting Miller’s Professional Imaging 
I also stopped by Miller’s Professional Imaging in Pittsburg to learn more about their operation as one of the largest photography printing labs in the country. The tour, led by David Doria, highlighted how they have expanded and adapted over the years to offer more services in the digital market and how they increased their production efficiency during the pandemic. I enjoyed viewing all the different printing options they offer and learning about their digital consumer base through their MPIX platform.  Also on the tour was Richard Miller – the owner of Miller’s – President Todd Coleman and Joe Dellasega. I appreciated hearing about their programs to support and incentivize employees, as well as their philanthropic efforts around the Pittsburg community. Hometown businesses are invested in their community and often play a large part in its wellbeing. I appreciated hearing about Miller’s impact from local Chamber of Commerce President Blake Benson and Deputy City Manager Jay Byers. 
  
 
  
Speaking to Manhattan’s Military Relation Committee 
On Wednesday, I spoke to the Manhattan Military Relations Committee, an entity of the Manhattan Area Chamber of Commerce, to give a federal update about efforts to support the military community. With the close proximity of Fort Riley, cities like Manhattan and Junction City play an important role in making our military feel welcome, supporting Big Red One soldiers, as well as helping to retain brigades.  I was able to report that because of new legislation signed into law last year, Big Red One soldiers who gave the ultimate sacrifice during Desert Storm, Operation Iraqi Freedom, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation New Dawn will now have their names added to the First Division Monument located on White House grounds.  I also discussed my work on the SAVE LIVES Act, which now allows veteran spouses and caregivers to be vaccinated through the Veterans Health Administration, and our efforts to address veteran mental health and suicide prevention.  Special thanks to Janet Nichols for the invitation, as well as Lt. Gen. Perry Wiggins, the Governor’s Military Council Executive Director, for his keynote. Read more here in the Manhattan Mercury. 
  
Meeting with Kansas Community Colleges 
I was pleased to join the Kansas Community College Council of Presidents for their quarterly meeting this week. During the meeting we discussed ways to improve workforce development, the importance of Pell grants in providing educational opportunities to low-income individuals, protecting student veterans from reductions in GI Bill benefits as a result of COVID-19 and the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. I sincerely value the insight that each of our state’s community college presidents offer and appreciated hearing from them on issues facing their institutions. As a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, I look forward to continuing working closely with our Kansas community colleges to make certain their efforts to provide quality higher education are supported at the federal level. 
  
Discussing Kansas City Southern’s Recent Merger 
On Monday, I met with Kansas City Southern’s President Pat Ottensmeyer and Executive Vice President Administration & Corporate Affairs Warren Erdman regarding their recent merger with the Canadian Pacific Railway. Once combined, they will create the first rail network linking the U.S., Mexico and Canada, which will help support Kansas exports with improved efficiency and reduced transit times. I appreciated the update and thank them both for the meeting. 
  
Visiting with Paul DeBruce of the DeBruce Foundation 
This week, I visited with Paul DeBruce, founder of the DeBruce Foundation and former president of DeBruce Grain, Inc. The DeBruce Foundation, located in Kansas City, helps individuals expand their pathways to economic growth and opportunity and changes the way they pursue their careers. The foundation’s mission looks to widen peoples’ understandings of what makes a successful professional career and helps open up new career possibilities and opportunities through their initiatives and strategic partnerships. The company’s initiative to help these individuals secure success is valuable, especially as they look to enter the workforce or begin a new career path. I appreciated the ability to hear all that this foundation does to serve its community. Thank you to Mr. DeBruce for meeting with me. 
  
Meeting with McCownGordon Construction 
I also met with the leadership team at McCownGordon Construction this week. I appreciated learning more about how their employee stock ownership plan, allowing their company to be 100% employee owned and how their early adaptation of drone technology has benefited their company. Thank you to CEO Ramin Cherafat, Chief People Officer Nancy Whitworth, Vice President Todd Knight and Director Pat Contreras for the helpful meeting. 
  
Recognizing Gold Star Spouses Day 
On Gold Star Spouses Day on Monday, we paused to honor the men and women who have lost a spouse or loved one who died while defending our country. Military service is family service, and we recognize their sacrifice and their resilience. 
  
 
  
Recognizing Holocaust Remembrance Day 
Thursday was Holocaust Remembrance Day or Yom Hashoah, a day on which humanity reflects on the atrocities of the Holocaust and remembers the lives of the six million Jews who perished. The undying courage of all victims and survivors must never be forgotten. 
  
 
  
Honored to Serve You in Washington  It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.

December 6, 2020 
Dear Friends, 
As we near the end of the Trump Administration, it is clear that the damage this President has wrought over the last four years will take a lot of work to undo and overcome. From his failure to address the deadly COVID-19 pandemic – even now as we record daily record breaking numbers of infections and our hospitals are stretched to the point of breaking – to an onslaught of attacks on the environment; health care; education; women's rights, civil rights, and LGBTQ rights; and basic norms and decency; the damage that he's done is undeniable and may not be fully realized for months or years to come.  There has been good news this week, however. From the break in Senator Mitch McConnell's refusal to come to the table to work with Speaker Pelosi on a COVID relief package before the end of the year, to the strong cabinet choices that the Biden-Harris Administration have announced. Despite continued obstruction from the Trump White House to the Biden transition team, President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris are working hard now so that they are able to hit the ground running in January. They have already begun formulating a federal response to the pandemic – which includes more virus testing, more protective gear, and clear guidance for businesses and schools based on science and facts – and we are getting closer to the distribution of a COVID vaccine, possibly multiple vaccines, revealing the light at the end of this dark tunnel. 
Though there remain many other critical issues and crises to tackle, I am confident that we will overcome these hardships with President-Elect Biden at the helm and the strength and courage of the American people.  Thank you for reading and all my best,

The Trump Administration Is Reversing More Than 100 Environmental Rules. Here’s the Full List.
By Nadja Popovich, Livia Albeck-Ripka and Kendra Pierre-Louis, The New York Times


Over four years in office, the Trump administration has dismantled major climate policies and rolled back many more rules governing clean air, water, wildlife and toxic chemicals.

While other administrations have emphasized cutting regulations, calling them burdensome to industries like coal, oil and gas, the scope of actions under Mr. Trump is “fundamentally different,” said Hana V. Vizcarra, a staff attorney at Harvard Law School’s Environmental and Energy Law Program.

In all, a New York Times analysis, based on research from Harvard Law School, Columbia Law School and other sources, counts more than 80 environmental rules and regulations officially reversed, revoked or otherwise rolled back under Mr. Trump. Another 20 rollbacks are still in progress.

For contact tracers, COVID-19 fight is personal: ‘I understand hardship’ 

By Colleen Shalby, The Los Angeles Times
Sometimes when he calls, the person on the other end of the phone already knows.  I’m not surprised.   Sometimes, they deny the news.  This is a hoax.   Often, they reel from it.  I can’t afford not to work.   Though each conversation differs, the disquieting messages Levonn Gardner delivers are the same.  “You have been exposed to the coronavirus,” he tells some. “You have tested positive for the virus,” he tells others.  Gardner is a contact tracer, part of an army of hired public health workers who notify those who have tested positive for the virus and identify those they may have exposed to the pathogen that causes COVID-19. The conversations are confidential and sometimes surprisingly intimate. Some last minutes, others hours. And as Gardner and two other contact tracers shared, much of the job relies on intuition shaped by cultural and familial ties — bonds that make the work personal.  To read the complete article, click here.   
The Inside Story of Michigan’s Fake Voter Fraud Scandal
How a state that was never in doubt became a ""national embarrassment"" and a symbol of the Republican Party’s fealty to Donald Trump.
By Tim Alberta, Politico

After five years spent bullying the Republican Party into submission, President Donald Trump finally met his match in Aaron Van Langevelde.  Who?  That’s right. In the end, it wasn’t a senator or a judge or a general who stood up to the leader of the free world. There was no dramatic, made-for-Hollywood collision of cosmic egos. Rather, the death knell of Trump’s presidency was sounded by a baby-faced lawyer, looking over his glasses on a grainy Zoom feed on a gloomy Monday afternoon, reading from a statement that reflected a courage and moral clarity that has gone AWOL from his party, pleading with the tens of thousands of people watching online to understand that some lines can never be uncrossed.  “We must not attempt to exercise power we simply don’t have,” declared Van Langevelde, a member of Michigan’s board of state canvassers, the ministerial body with sole authority to make official Joe Biden’s victory over Trump. “As John Adams once said, 'We are a government of laws, not men.' This board needs to adhere to that principle here today. This board must do its part to uphold the rule of law and comply with our legal duty to certify this election.”  To read the complete article, click here.  
And Play Like a Girl She Did
Vanderbilt’s Sarah Fuller is the first woman to play Power 5 football. She’s been a long time coming.
By Margaret Renkl, The New York Times

NASHVILLE — When Sarah Fuller stepped onto the field at the University of Missouri on Nov. 28, she wasn’t wearing the jersey she normally wears as a goalkeeper for Vanderbilt University’s women’s soccer team. On that Saturday after Thanksgiving, she was wearing full pads and a Commodores football jersey. Her helmet was emblazoned with the words “Play Like a Girl.”  When Ms. Fuller kicked off for the Commodores at the beginning of the game’s second half, she also kicked through a glass ceiling, becoming the first woman to play in a Power 5 football game. (Other women have played college football, though none at the elite level of the Power 5 conferences, which include the Atlantic Coast Conference, Big Ten Conference, Big 12 Conference, Pac-12 Conference, and Southeastern Conference.)  This wasn’t the culmination of a young woman’s lifelong goal, and it wasn’t a publicity stunt by a team in the midst of a humiliating season. Coronavirus quarantines had left Vanderbilt without a kicker, and Ms. Fuller, a 21-year-old senior from Wylie, Texas, was the team’s best hope. The Commodores hadn’t won a single football game all season, while Vanderbilt Women’s Soccer had just won the Southeastern Conference Division 1 championship, its first title since 1994. And Ms. Fuller was a powerful kicker for the championship team.  Though she’d been practicing with the football team for less than a week, she knew exactly what she was doing: “Let’s make history,” she tweeted before the game.  To read the complete op-ed, click here.

Biden orders U.S. intelligence to increase effort to determine origin of COVID-19 virus
President Biden has ordered U.S. intelligence agencies to immediately step up their investigation into the origin of the COVID-19 virus. The order comes after viable reports surfaced that the virus was accidentally released from a Wuhan lab were declassified. Two weeks ago, a group of international scientists wrote a letter urging a new investigation into the possible leak of the virus from a Chinese state lab after initially believing that the virus species jumped from animals, most likely bats, to humans. Biden wants a report in ninety days on the results of the investigation, which is an intelligence rather than a scientific effort. The Administration has previously been relying on the World Health Organization (WHO) to research the origins of the virus. The Chinese government denies that the virus leaked from their labs.  
Confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, vaccinations in Tennessee 
Yesterday, the Tennessee Department of Health reported 392 new cases, bringing the total to more than 862,098 confirmed cases. Twenty-two people died yesterday with more than 12,498 people that have died and 519 who are currently hospitalized with the virus statewide. There have been more than 7.95 million tests completed with a 3.38% positivity rate. As of today in Davidson County, there have been 99,528 (16 new) confirmed cases and 928 deaths. 
As of Monday, 4,818,010 vaccinations have been administered in Tennessee, only 100,000 new in the last week. About 39% of all Tennesseans have received their first dose and 33% are fully vaccinated. The state is below the national rate: 50% of all Americans have received one dose and 40% are fully vaccinated, or some states with over 65% with at least one dose.  
The federal government has delivered nearly 361 million doses of vaccine and 291 million shots have been given nationwide.  
Go to Vaccines.gov or text your zip code to GETVAX (for English) or VACUNA (for Spanish) to find available vaccines at a location near you. 
 

Biden to release $6 trillion budget proposal 
Today, President Biden presented a $6 trillion 2022 budget to Congress. The proposal will include significant spending to grow the economy, creating jobs, fund his American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan to strengthen safety net programs, and improve and repair the country’s infrastructure. The President’s plan also focuses on healthcare, specifically reducing prescription drug costs, and expanding Medicare coverage and benefits. Biden has proposed covering the cost of the budget with a series of tax increases on corporations and the wealthiest Americans. The budget will face stiff opposition from Congressional Republicans who are already balking at the cost of the President’s $1.7 trillion infrastructure plan and expressing concerns about deficit spending. 

  
Senate Republicans vote to kill bipartisan commission to investigate Capitol insurrection  
Senate Republicans voted against a bill to create an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate the January 6 Capitol attack. The final vote was 54 to 35. Eleven Senators, mostly Republicans, did not vote. Despite pleas from injured Capitol Police officers, the family of an officer killed during the riot, and a group of former Secretaries of Homeland Security, only six  Republicans joined Democrats to support the bill, falling short of the 60 votes needed to create the commission. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell personally asked his Republican colleagues to oppose the commission even though he supported such an investigative committee in the days immediately following the insurrection.  

  
Senate approves Wormuth as Secretary of the Army 
Yesterday, the Senate unanimously confirmed Christine Wormuth as the first female Secretary of the Army. Most recently, she served as the Director of International Security and Defense Policy at the RAND Corporation. She was the Undersecretary of Defense Policy at the Pentagon, and as the Senior Director of Defense Policy on the National Security Council during the Obama Administration.  

Biden to meet with Putin next month 
President Biden will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin for an in-person discussion next month in Geneva. The summit is an attempt by the Biden Administration to improve the relationship between the two countries that has been deteriorating over the past several years. Biden is expected to raise concerns over Russia’s production of nuclear weapons, troop build-up along the border with Ukraine, interference in U.S. elections, and climate change. The meeting is not expected to produce any major agreements, but rather is viewed as an opportunity to create better cooperation.  
U.S. to reopen Jerusalem consulate to engage with Palestinians 
After a meeting with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced Tuesday that the U.S. would reopen its consulate in Jerusalem in order to restore ties with Palestinians. The consulate, which was closed by the Trump administration, oversaw U.S. diplomatic relations with the Palestinian Authority for more than twenty years before its operations were merged the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu raised reservations about the move in a meeting with Blinken and said he’d prefer for the consulate to remain part of the main U.S. embassy in Jerusalem rather than an independent diplomatic mission. 
+ Jim said, “Yesterday, the Biden administration announced its plans to reopen the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem after its closure by former President Trump. For more than two decades, this consulate was an important diplomatic link between the United States and the Palestinian Authority. I support steps to rebuild this relationship in a way that provides Palestinians and Israelis alike with respect, security, and dignity.”

4/9/21 16:20,Local Leadership is the Key to Our Energy Future,"Local Leadership is the Key to Our Energy Future


Thanks to the TRi Energy partnership, our country’s FIRST advanced nuclear reactor is going to be built right here in the Tri-Cities, producing carbon-free, renewable energy. This collaboration between local business, government, and community leaders - including Energy Northwest, Grant County Public Utility District (PUD), and X-energy LLC - shows that local leadership is the force that will propel our energy infrastructure into the future. 

I was pleased to be be a part of the signing ceremony that made the partnership official. This is not only a huge step forward for our nation’s clean energy future, but it will also be a powerful job creator for Central Washington.

ICYMI: We Don't Need A Bigger Budget


Politicians like to tell you that there’s only one way to pay for new projects: raising taxes. After all, the money has to come from somewhere. Right?

Rather than taking more money out of your pocket to pay for hidden pet projects, I say it’s past time we take a hard look at where the money you’re already giving the government is going. In 2019, Americans contributed $3.5 trillion in taxes, more than enough to create a balanced budget. It’s high time we got rid of wasteful spending. 

We don’t need a bigger budget; we need a better budget.

Keeping Central Washington's Economy Moving


The U.S. Department of Transportation's Federal Aviation Administration recently announced $2.3 million in grants for needed improvements to municipal airports in Washington’s 4th Congressional District.

Local airports spur a significant amount of economic development throughout our district and provide a steady source of income for our communities. These grants are a substantial federal investment that will allow these airports to implement important safety measures and continue to support local jobs.

Job Creating Powerhouses: Central Washington's Inland Ports






This past week, I spent some time visiting our inland ports - including the Port of Mattawa, the Port of Quincy, and the Port of Warden - and learning more about the work they're doing every day to ensure our agricultural and manufactured goods get to market. 

From job creation to transportation of our agricultural and manufactured goods, our ports are vital to our communities. I am proud of the important role Washington’s ports – including Central Washington’s inland ports – play in our state’s economy. I will continue to work to strengthen our ports and enable them to bring the greatest possible benefit to our local economies. 


Central Washington Community Project Funding

My office is currently accepting eligible Community Project Funding requests that will improve the lives of Central Washingtonians and support the economic prosperity of Washington state.

The Committee on Appropriations recently announced that it will be accepting Community Project Funding requests from Members of Congress, designed to help deliver additional, targeted federal funding to select projects in districts across the country. Community Project Funding requests can be submitted on my website and must be submitted by Friday, April 16th. 

In order to determine which projects best meet the requirements and criteria of Community Project Funding, including community engagement and support, I have established the Central Washington Community Project Funding Advisory Board. This board is comprised of one representative from each county and tribe in Washington’s 4th Congressional District. The Advisory Board will work in conjunction with my office and the House Appropriations Committee to determine which projects will have the most impact in Washington’s 4th Congressional District.

Supporting Students and Teachers



I spent some time this week with teachers and students at Grandview High School to learn about how they have coped with the COVID-19 pandemic.

After a year out of school, our students have sacrificed far too much. Nothing can truly replace in-person instruction. It's great to see our students back in school, and I will continue to work to support our students and teachers so that they can thrive here in Central Washington and beyond.

Protecting the Right to Life 




On Wednesday I joined Rep. Kay Granger and my House Appropriations Committee Republican colleagues in sending a letter urging Chair DeLauro to keep the Hyde Amendment and pro-life protections in FY22 appropriations bills. 

As a father and man of faith, I am deeply committed to defending life, and I strongly believe that Americans should not be forced to violate their conscience and pay for the destruction of human life.

2/27/21 11:13,A Plan to End the Pandemic,"Dear Neighbors,
Last night, the House passed the American Rescue Plan that struggling families desperately need to help stay afloat during this ongoing public health and economic crisis. This legislation implements a national plan to crush the COVID-19 pandemic. It provides the tools and resources we need to ramp up distribution and administration of lifesaving vaccines and testing to track and trace new hotspots before they become larger outbreaks.  
The bill expands access to quality, affordable health care coverage to millions of Americans who lack access to care in the midst of the pandemic. The American Rescue Plan also includes vital assistance to help families keep the lights on, the heat working, the water running, and to expand internet connectivity to help students and teachers without home internet access. It will also deliver critical aid to our state and local governments. Read more here
My Energy and Commerce Committee held a hearing this week with vaccine manufacturers to hear what steps each company is taking to rapidly expand vaccine production, what hurdles might stand in the way, and what additional help they need to increase supply. Widespread access to vaccines and ensuring reliable production lines are in place is essential to achieve herd immunity and end this pandemic. Read more here
I also held another hearing on disinformation and extremism that are a threat to our nation. It has been especially dangerous over the past year when media outlets downplayed the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic, peddled ineffective treatments, and mocked effective precautionary measures. We owe it to our constituents and our democracy to examine how and why disinformation is being aired on traditional media and social media. Read more here
A Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel approved Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine on Friday. Formal emergency use authorization from FDA is expected over the weekend.

May 13, 2021Dear Friend,I hope this e-newsletter finds you well and Eid Mubarak to all those observing. Eid is about community, about coming together and sharing in joy. To those celebrating, I hope your days are filled with family, friends, and warmth – even in this difficult time. 
We are making real progress thanks to the American Rescue Plan and will continue to push for more relief for families. In other good news, The Montgomery County Office of Public Health announced that the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is now available for people aged 12-15 at its County-run vaccine clinics. Anyone under the age of 18 attending a Montgomery County Office of Public Health COVID-19 vaccination clinic must be accompanied by a parent or guardian.  
 
Where can you get vaccinated?To find the vaccine provider closest to you, click here.  
Register online with Montgomery County. For general COVID-19 questions or to pre-register for the vaccine by phone, call the Montgomery County COVID-19 hotline at (833) 875-3967. Pre-registration by phone is available to seniors and people without internet access. The hotline is open six days a week, Monday through Saturday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. 
Please note the hotline cannot provide updates or timelines on vaccine pre-registration, please refer to the instructions received in your confirmation email. General questions can be emailed to covid19@montcopa.org. 
In the Community I loved being in the district, meeting with local community members earlier this week to learn from their experiences. As more people are vaccinated and restrictions are lifted, I am looking forward to being in the community even more. If you’d like to request a meeting with our office, click here. 
 
Meeting with Holy Redeemer Hospital, who requested Community Project Funding to expand their ""Care Without Limits"" program. A program that treats babies with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) and Mothers suffering from addiction. 
Community Project FundingRecently, the Committee on Appropriations announced that it would accept Community Project Funding requests from members of Congress during the 2022 Fiscal year. This new appropriations process was an opportunity for our office to advocate for funding for non-profit and governmental agencies in our district that have community-based projects addressing our most pressing needs. We received requests for dozens of wonderful projects, however, we were limited to submitting 10 projects for consideration to the committee—final submissions can be found here. Next, the Appropriations Committee will review our recommendations for inclusion in our final annual budget. Though our recommendations do not guarantee funding, we are excited to fight for more funding to our district and look forward to working to bring more investment to our area. 
Legislative UpdateRecently, I introduced H.R. 2751, the PFAS Accountability Act of 2021. If passed, the bill would ensure accountability for irresponsible PFAS manufacturing by creating a federal cause of action and improved legal pathways to award medical monitoring for PFAS contamination victims in order to prevent premature morbidity, disability, and mortality. It’s long past time for us to hold polluters accountable and the PFAS Accountability Act is a first step in restorative justice. Senator Gillibrand is leading a Senate companion and I was pleased to introduce the bill alongside Rep. Kildee in the House. This week I partnered with Congressman Bryan Steil (WI-01) to introduce H.R. 3094, the Treasury Human Trafficking Coordinator Act: This bill would require the Secretary of the Treasury to designate a Coordinator for Human Trafficking Issues. This person would be responsible for coordinating actions, programs, and initiatives across the Treasury Department relating to human trafficking and support for survivors. And today, Thursday May 13, the House is expected to pass The Comprehensive Debt Collection Improvement Act, this bill included language from two bills I led: - The Fair Debt Collection Practices for Servicemembers Act: This bill works to support those who protect and serve our country and their families from abusive debt collection practices. The bill prohibits a debt collector from conveying any threats to a servicemember or third parties, including a dependent or commanding officer to have the servicemember’s rank reduced, their security clearance revoked, or to have them prosecuted under the Uniform Code of Military Justice for failing to cooperate with a debt collector - The Private Loan Disability Discharge Act: This bill was written after a constituent came to our office in need. This bill aligns private student loan protections with those of federal student loans by requiring lenders to discharge debt in the case of a total and permanent disability of the borrower. While discharge is currently required under law for death, private student loan lenders can create their own terms and conditions for releasing due to a total and permanent disability. The last week of April, my office also submitted our annual appropriations requests. These requests are split between 12 different appropriations bills. Annual requests span a large area of issues including funding for the NIH and CDC to disease research at the DOD, to Agriculture Department Funds to support affordable food programs and Transportation funds to support SEPTA and Amtrak. This year, our requests also included Community Project Funding – proposals for direct funds into our community. 
Tax Update 
IRS Update on Economic Impact Payments The IRS will continue to make Economic Impact Payments on a weekly basis.  Ongoing payments will be sent to eligible individuals for whom the IRS has information, for individuals the IRS previously did not have information to issue a payment but who recently filed a tax return, as well to people who qualify for “plus-up” payments, which are supplemental payments for people who earlier this year received payments based on their 2019 tax returns but are eligible for a new or larger payment based on their recently processed 2020 tax returns.The IRS and Pennsylvania Department of Revenue has extended the deadline to submit your 2020 tax returns to May 17th, 2021. Information regarding issues with the first or second Economic Impact Payments If the IRS did not issue you the first two Economic Impact Payments or sent less than the amount you should have received, you must file a 2020 tax return and claim the Recovery Rebate Credit on line 30 to get the payments — even if you are not normally required to file a tax return. The Glenside and Norristown district offices have popular tax forms available in an outdoor pick-up box, including the 1040-SR that has features to make tax filing easier for seniors.Tax forms are also available to download and print from the IRS website at https://www.irs.gov/forms-instructions or you can call 1-800-TAX-FORM to have forms shipped to your home.The IRS's VITA and TCE programs offer free basic tax return preparation to qualified individuals. The VITA/TCE locator tool is available on the IRS website to help find a tax preparation site near you.Healthcare Open Enrollment Having reliable, affordable health insurance is more important than ever during the COVID-19 pandemic. A Special Enrollment Period is now open and will remain open until May 15. Get Covered today at HealthCare.gov.SBA Update There is still time for some small businesses to apply through the U.S. Small Business Administration, in consultation with the U.S. Treasury Department, for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). PPP applications are still being accepted by Community Financial Institutions since they still have set-aside funding available--traditional banking institution funds are exhausted in PPP.  This SBA program is designed to efficiently and effectively implement the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act and to ensure increased access to the PPP for minority-, underserved-, veteran- and women-owned small business concerns. Eligible borrowers in underserved and disadvantaged communities can access this program exclusively through Community Financial Institutions (CFIs) that typically serve these concerns. The deadline to apply is May 31, 2021. Here are some organizations accepting applications:PIDC – Accepting PPP for customers and non-customers The Enterprise Center - Accepting PPP for customers and non-customers RBAC - Accepting PPP for customers and non-customers
Ascendus - Accepting PPP for customers and non-customers For more information click here. Resources Find food assistance resources near you. 
Mental health and substance use disorder help is available. See the latest COVID-19 guidance and resources for Pennsylvanians. Download the COVID Alert PA mobile app for exposure notifications. Staying Healthy Thank you for your continued efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19! Let’s continue taking proper precautions -- practicing social distancing, wearing masks, and remaining vigilant. Montgomery County residents can get tested for COVID-19 by registering online here. For Berks County residents, please visit the Berks County Website or click here for information about testing options near you.Stay Safe and Healthy,

The GPEI has made tremendous progress toward global eradication with WPV circulating in only 2 countries in 2020, Afghanistan and Pakistan, down from 125 countries in 1988.

Center for Advanced Manufacturing Excellence: Florida MEP Center – Department of Commerce
	•	Recipient: Florida Makes, Inc.
	•	Award: $4,210,215
	•	Description: Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) is a public-private partnership, designed from inception as a cost-share program. Federal appropriations pay one-half, with the balance for each Center funded by state / local governments and/or private entities, plus client fees. This cost-share model contributes to MEP's success. A GAO study found that because client fees give manufacturers a higher stake in the outcome of services, the positive impact on their businesses is greater. Meanwhile, public funding allows smaller manufacturers to afford services. As a public-private partnership, the Program delivers a high return on investment to taxpayers. For every dollar of federal investment in FY 2019, the MEP National Network generated $33.80 in new sales growth and $32.20 in new client investment. This translates into $4.7 billion in new sales. During this same time, for every $1,221 of federal investment, the Network created or retained one manufacturing job.

Congressional Report
 
 
Dear Friend,
 
My top priority is to save lives and rebuild our economy by making sure communities in my district, and across the nation, have access to COVID-19 vaccines, PPP and their direct payments. However, we cannot address these critical issues if there continues to be violence to our way of life.  
 
Last Wednesday's breach of the Capitol was not only dangerous and heartbreaking to witness, but it was especially horrific to see that the president's rhetoric helped incite this violence. In his final days as president, it is clear that he is unfit to adhere to the oath of office - 'preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States'.
 
This is why I have traveled back to Washington DC to call on the Vice President to invoke the 25th amendment as well as stand with my colleagues in supporting articles of impeachment. 
 
We will not let this lawlessness deter us from fulfilling our constitutional duty and on Jan. 20th, America will see a peaceful transfer of power. 
 

 
 
Rep. Cuellar Visits Rio Bravo and Zapata
 


  
On Monday, January 11th, I visited Rio Bravo and Zapata to provide updates on COVID-19 relief, vaccine distributions and more. In Congress, I'm working hard to ensure you and your families receive the necessary resources to combat the pandemic. During my visits, I had the opportunity to hear the thoughts, questions and concerns of  my constituents as well as figure out ways we can work together in defeating the virus.

'Conversation with Cuellar' 
 

  
On Friday, January 8th, I held a 'Conversation with Cuellar' to discuss authorization language I secured in the Omnibus Appropriations and Emergency Coronavirus Relief package. I worked hard to include authorization language that will create a Latino museum in the nation’s capital, increase economic partnerships between the U.S. and Mexico, expand universal charitable giving deduction for tax year 2021, and protect patients from receiving “surprise” medical bills. Watch the livestream here.

Memorial Service for City of Roma Police Chief
 

  
On Thursday, January 7th, my Outreach Coordinator for Starr and Hidalgo Counties, Nicolas Cruz, paid his respects to Roma Police Chief Jose Garcia. For 36 years, Officer Garcia protected our community, with 27.5 of those years as chief of the police force. He was an exceptional leader in our community and his presence will be greatly missed. My thoughts and prayers are with his family.

Paycheck Protection Program Loans 
 

  
On January 11th, the Small Business Administration re-opened PPP loans to Community Development Financial Institutions. In an effort to address potential barriers for underserved small businesses, SBA is granting PPP access exclusively to community financial institutions that typically serve these concerns - minority, underserved, Veteran and women-owned business).

VIDEO: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - Wear a Mask to Protect You and Your Friends
 
 

 
  
While COVID-19 vaccines are being distributed to communities across the country, it's still important that we continue wearing a mask, practice social distancing, washing our hands frequently and other CDC guidelines. 
 
Stay safe and protect yourself and your loved ones!

 
Sincerely,

5/28/21 16:06,There is a Crisis at Our Southern Border,"There is a Crisis at Our Southern Border


This past weekend, I visited the southern border town of El Paso, TX, and there is no doubt about it: the Biden Administration's policies have created an unmitigated crisis. 



As a farmer, it’s hard to imagine not being able to walk through your orchards or fields without carrying a weapon. But down in El Paso, that’s the reality facing these men and women because of the daily threat they face from the drug cartels passing through. For them, the best thing to happen for their safety was building a border fence, and they’ve made it clear that finishing our wall is not just a priority, it’s a necessity. 


Not only are American civilians at risk, but our border agents are overwhelmed. While hundreds of migrants cross the border illegally during the night, and children are smuggled across the border by unchecked drug cartels, the Biden Administration not only ignores the problem, but seeks to further tie the hands of law enforcement and weaken border security measures. 




The Administration’s attempts to sweep this crisis under the rug are harming our citizens, law enforcement officers, and the hundreds of thousands of migrants coming across the border – while emboldening the drug cartels to be even more blatant in their trafficking operations. Our border is neither secure nor safe, and President Biden and his ‘border czar’ must take action now to change that.

The National Debt is a National Security Risk


President Biden continues to put forth trillion-dollar packages, racking up debt that Americans cannot afford. Today, our national debt tops $28,000,000,000,000 and poses a very real threat to the United States. 

Central Washington’s communities deserve better. That's why I cosponsored a resolution in the House to recognize our out-of-control debt as a national security threat. We cannot continue to be financially beholden to foreign powers if we are to be a sovereign and secure nation. It's well past time for Congress and the Biden Administration to take this crisis seriously and balance the budget - our national security depends on it.

Unanimous Support for Northwest Hydropower


On Wednesday, the House Committee on Natural Resources unanimously approved my bill, H.R. 2641, the Pacific Northwest Pumped Storage Hydropower Development Act of 2021. I introduced this bill to help increase renewable energy production and storage in the Pacific Northwest by improving permitting for pumped storage hydroelectric projects, creating jobs in Central Washington, and protecting Tribal interests. 

This is a huge step forward in enhancing Central Washington’s hydropower capabilities, creating jobs, and encouraging investment in clean energy across the country. I am grateful for the support this legislation has already received, and I am hopeful we can maintain this momentum to pass it in the House and through the Senate.

Senator Portman announced on Monday morning that he would not seek another six-year term in the United States Senate when his current term expires in 2022.  
On Tuesday, Portman joined Fox News’s America’s Newsroom with Bill Hemmer and Dana Perino to discuss that decision and reiterated his commitment to being a fair and impartial juror who will listen to all of the facts during the impeachment proceedings that the Senate is expected to convene in February. Portman also  joined CNBC’s The News with Shepard Smith Thursday night to discuss the need for bipartisanship in the ongoing COVID-19 relief negotiations. 
On Thursday, Portman introduced Representative Marcia Fudge (D-OH) at the Senate Banking Committee hearing on her nomination to serve as Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Senator Portman and Representative Fudge have worked together on a number of issues for Ohioans, including efforts to combat the housing crisis in Ohio and across the nation, and he supports her confirmation. 
Finally, Portman spoke with Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan about his decision to forgo re-election, the upcoming impeachment trial, and his optimistic outlook for the future of the Republican party. 
For a more detailed look at Senator Portman’s week, please see the following: 
Monday, January 25, 2021 
Portman Statement on Political Future 
Portman issued the following statement announcing that he will not seek another six-year term in the United States Senate when his current term expires in 2022:  
""I feel fortunate to have been entrusted by the people of Ohio to represent them in the US Senate. Today, I am announcing that I have made a decision not to run again in 2022. 
""This doesn’t mean I’m leaving now – I still have two more years in my term and I intend to use that time to get a lot done. I will be the top Republican on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and I have a number of oversight projects and legislative initiatives I’m eager to get across the finish line. Over the next two years, I look forward to being able to focus all my energy on legislation and the challenges our country faces rather than on fundraising and campaigning.  
""This was not an easy decision because representing the people of Ohio has been an honor. But I’ve been doing this a long time, longer than I ever intended.  
""I’ve been in public service for 30 years – in the House of Representatives for 12, in the Executive Branch for about eight years in various roles in four different administrations, and in the Senate for the past 10 years. All this time, our family has kept our home in Ohio, where we raised our kids, and I have commuted back and forth to Washington. Jane and our three children have been 100 percent supportive, but I am really looking forward to being home in Ohio full time, seeing family and friends more, and getting back to the private sector, including being able to be more involved in the community and in our family business. And I plan to stay involved in public policy issues.  
""During my service in the Senate, I am proud of what we’ve been able to accomplish for Ohio and the country. I have consistently been named one of the most bipartisan Senators. I am proud of that and I will continue to reach out to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find common ground.  
""Eighty-two of my bills were signed into law by President Trump, and 68 were signed into law by President Obama. This includes impactful laws to address the drug addiction crisis like the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act that has saved lives by providing billions in new resources for evidence-based prevention, treatment and, for the first time ever, recovery services. It includes laws to confront the horrific crime of human trafficking. Working with trafficking victims, advocates, and law enforcement, my SESTA legislation has allowed victims to seek justice, and closed down websites that were trafficking girls and women online.  
""It includes laws to help workers, legislation that before the pandemic helped create one of the strongest economies in a generation, with significant wage growth for working families and the lowest poverty level ever recorded. I took a leadership role on tax reform and tax cuts, workforce training, regulatory relief and permitting reform. They all played a role in creating an opportunity economy and are key to getting us back on track. I have also been a leader on retirement security, technology policy, cybersecurity, trade, energy efficiency, prisoner reentry, National Parks, stopping China from stealing our technology, and more. I have worked constructively with my colleague, Senator Sherrod Brown, on matters that help move Ohio forward. 
""I don’t think any Senate office has been more successful in getting things done, but honestly, it has gotten harder and harder to break through the partisan gridlock and make progress on substantive policy, and that has contributed to my decision. 
""We live in an increasingly polarized country where members of both parties are being pushed further to the right and further to the left, and that means too few people who are actively looking to find common ground. This is not a new phenomenon, of course, but a problem that has gotten worse over the past few decades.  
""This is a tough time to be in public service. For many of the issues I am most passionate about, I will continue to make a difference outside of the Senate, beyond 2022. In the meantime, I am hopeful that President Biden will follow through on his inaugural pledge to reach across the aisle, and I am prepared to work with him and his administration if he does. I was on the bipartisan call yesterday on a new COVID-19 package. I hope the Administration will work with us on a more targeted approach that focuses on things like vaccine distribution, testing and getting kids back to school. 
""I want to thank the great people of Ohio for giving me the incredible opportunity to serve, and I look forward to continuing to work hard for them over the next two years. I appreciate my friends in every corner of Ohio and across the political spectrum who encourage me and help me better represent our diverse state. I thank them for what they do for our communities and for the inspiration they give me.  
""I want to thank my amazing staff both in Ohio and in DC. They work really hard for the people of Ohio and have enabled me to be so much more effective. I know I am biased, but I really believe they are the best team in the Senate, and others think that, too. 
""Of course, I will always be grateful to the voters of Ohio who have supported me in nine elections to the House and Senate. Thanks to them, I’ve never lost an election and never won by less than 18 points. I am confident that with their support I could have won again but, for me, the question was whether I wanted to serve an additional six years in the Senate.  
""I decided to make my announcement now because I have made up my mind, but also because it will allow whichever Republicans who choose to run plenty of time to gear up for a statewide race. 
""Finally, and most importantly, a special thanks to Jane and our family for the unconditional support and for the sacrifices they have made -- and will continue to make for the next two years. I appreciate Jane, Jed, Sara and Sally for being here today and for the well wishes from Will and Tyler who weren’t able to travel to Cincinnati this morning. We are a team.  
""In these next two years, I will continue to be actively engaged, doing my best to provide hope as we try to get through the devastating coronavirus pandemic and doing my best to help bring our great country together, to help us heal, so we address the many challenges we face together.""

On Fox News, Portman Discusses Future of the Republican Party & Upcoming Impeachment Trial in Senate 
On Fox News’s America’s Newsroom with Bill Hemmer and Dana Perino, Portman discussed his decision announced yesterday that he will not seek another six-year term in the United States Senate when his current term expires in 2022. In addition, Portman reiterated his commitment to being a fair and impartial juror who will listen to all of the facts during the impeachment proceedings that the Senate is expected to convene in February. 
A transcript of the interview can be found here and a video can be found here. 
Portman Statement on Senate Procedural Vote on Impeachment 
Portman issued the following statement on the Senate procedural vote regarding impeachment today:  
""I’ve been very clear that former President Trump bears some responsibility for what happened on January 6 through his words and actions. I will listen as a juror, but as I have said, I do have questions about the constitutionality of holding a Senate trial and removing from office someone who is now a private citizen. This is a serious constitutional question, and today I voted for allowing debate on this issue and against tabling this important discussion. As the trial moves forward, I will listen to the evidence presented by both sides and then make a judgment based on the Constitution and what I believe is in the best interests of the country.""

Portman, Colleagues Urge President Biden to Follow Good Government Practices Regarding President Trump’s Late-Term Federal Regulations 
Portman led a letter with Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Deb Fischer (R-NE), James Lankford (R-OK), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Todd Young (R-IN), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Rick Scott (R-FL), Roger Marshall, MD (R-KS), and Bill Hagerty (R-TN) urging President Biden to follow good government practices regarding late-term federal regulations put forward by President Trump’s administration, and reminding him that there are proper procedures in place to ensure both thoughtful rulemaking and oversight of those rules by Congress. Final rules that have completed the rulemaking process generally do not go into effect until at least 30 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register, or, in the case of a “major rule” as designated by the Congressional Review Act, at least 60 days after publishing. In the event his administration seeks to delay some of these late-term federal regulations from going into effect, such a change would require notice-and-comment and the regular procedures should not be short-circuited in the interest of expediency.
""Over the course of the campaign, and more recently post-election, some transition officials and congressional leadership have used rhetoric that raises concern with those of us committed to good government and the well-being of the American people.  It would be unwise to undo the achievements of the last several years with rushed actions that undermine the thoughtful regulatory reforms that have saved Americans $50 billion in regulatory costs…Absent action by Congress expressing its disapproval with any late-term rules issued by the outgoing administration, an incoming administration should carry out its duties and faithfully execute federal law—including by allowing lawfully issued final rules to go into effect,” said the senators.  
A copy of the letter is available here. 
Portman, Cardin Reintroduce Tax Credit to Encourage Revitalization of Distressed Homes 
Senators Portman and Ben Cardin (D-MD), both members of the Senate Finance Committee, have introduced legislation to revitalize housing in distressed neighborhoods in Ohio, Maryland, and nationwide. Cosponsors include Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and Senate Finance Committee members Todd Young (R-IN), Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Tim Scott (R-SC).  Currently, private development lacks in some urban and rural areas because the cost of purchasing and renovating homes is greater than the value of the sale price of homes. The Neighborhood Homes Investment Act (NHIA) creates a federal tax credit that covers the cost between building or renovating a home in these areas and the price at which they can be sold. The NHIA would also help existing homeowners in these neighborhoods to renovate and stay in their homes.  
""The Neighborhood Homes Investment Act provides a tax credit to rehabilitate blighted homes and help revitalize neighborhoods across America and Ohio,"" said Senator Portman. “As we continue to battle the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this tax credit will encourage opportunity and investment in neighborhoods that are often home to vulnerable populations and marked by stagnant housing markets, foreclosures, and blighted or vacant homes. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this new incentive which will work in tandem with the New Markets Tax Credit, Opportunity Zones, and the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit to help Ohioans by providing desirable housing and generating new opportunities for their residents."" 
On CNBC, Portman Discusses Need for Bipartisan Negotiations on COVID-19 Relief 
On CNBC’s The News with Sheperd Smith, Portman discussed the importance of working in a bipartisan manner on COVID-19 relief negotiations. Portman also discussed the upcoming impeachment trial, the need for leadership at the Department of Homeland Security, and his decision to not seek another six-year term in the United States Senate when his current term expires in 2022.

Rob Portman’s Exit Interview 
Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio isn’t running for re-election in 2022. This is not good. He is a rightly respected figure. He tries to advance serious legislation. He doesn’t spend all his time talking on television. 
He cheerily returned my call Wednesday from “the beautiful Russell Office Building.” He thinks his office was once that of Sen. Harry Truman; his previous office had been occupied by Truman’s frequent antagonist, Ohio’s Sen. Robert Taft. Mr. Portman finds this satisfying. In 11 years in the Senate, he has been known for a bipartisan approach.
Before being elected to the Senate in 2010 (by 18 points) and 2016 (by 21), Mr. Portman had six terms in the House and stints as director of the Office of Management and Budget and U.S. trade representative, both under President George W. Bush. He’s dexterously made his way through the party’s Trumpian minefields. Over the years when national events have turned especially murky, I’ve asked his read on things, and what’s always struck me is his stubborn sense of reality: He doesn’t let his wishes get in the way of what he sees. In the geography of the Republican Party he’d be placed with figures like Mitch Daniels —the We Actually Know Things Caucus.
When he made his announcement Monday, he said the Senate is too polarized, common ground has been lost. He has been moved by the response: “It’s a crazy world right now, and this decision I made I thought normal, but the response was abnormal. I think people are really yearning for some renewed bipartisanship and cooperation.” Potential candidates for his seat have called to say they want to be like him. “It’s been crazy,” he laughs, “like dying a good death.""
He’s 65 and means it when he says he wants more time with his family: “I never expected to be a career politician.” He intends to make progress “on the outside” on issues he cares about—drug addiction, sex trafficking, a commission on mandatory federal spending.
It really is something that we’re living in a time when ambitious people leave the U.S. Senate to get things done. 
On his party’s prospects he’s somewhere between bullish and serene. Everybody is talking about the inevitability of breakup, but he doesn’t see it that way. The 2020 election, he argues, showed Republican strength—gains in the state legislatures and the U.S. House. He thinks coming elections can bring out traditional Republicans and summon new ones. “There’s a meshing of the traditional GOP agenda—lower taxes, strong military—with more-populist approaches on, say, immigration, on trade. In the real world you have to have a fair trade system, and it’s not un-Republican to think so.""
An altered tone would help. “This does require leaders who have the ability to communicate these messages without the coarseness and the divisiveness that we have seen over the last four, five years."" 
He sees his state as a microcosm of the country. In 2020, “a lot of the pushback in the suburbs was style and personality. The suburban, more educated folks in Ohio, who are independent voters these days—you can win these areas if you’re focused on the right policies, and more welcoming and embracing.” Donald Trump did well among minorities: “That was about issues—the economy, small business, lower taxes.""
In spite of the smallness and rage various state GOP committees are displaying now, we agree in this space with Mr. Portman’s sense that in the long term it is issues that count. The potential health and durability of the GOP will be based on an integration of old and still-applicable stands with new and still-urgent ones. But that process won’t proceed easily with Mr. Trump as a dominant force. If he’s on the scene it’s back to the old battle lines, and everyone dug in.
On the upcoming impeachment trial: “I have said I will listen to both sides, and I will. I’m a juror.” But he believes trying a former president probably sets a bad precedent. 
I asked about the comment of his former campaign manager Corry Bliss, published Tuesday in National Journal, on Portman’s decision not to run: “If you want to spend all your time on Fox and be an a—h—, there’s never been a better time to serve. But if you want to spend your time being thoughtful and getting s— done, there’s never been a worse time to serve.” Mr. Portman roared with laughter. “Did he say that?” He roared again. “Yeah, I won’t comment.""
Here I switch away from Mr. Portman to squeeze in something being overlooked on the coming impeachment debate. 
I started the new year talking with an ambassador to the U.S. from a European nation, who spoke of Mr. Trump’s campaign to delegitimize the election. Do Americans understand the damage this does to U.S. allies, the ambassador asked. We look to you for an example of how to do democracy—you’re the oldest in the world! It grieves us to see the beacon of democracy sullied in this way. 
Those words rang in my ears five days later as I watched the Capitol besieged.
On “Axios on HBO” Sunday we will hear from President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. He is playing a hard hand. Russia is breathing down his neck, Republicans don’t want to hear about him because they’re embarrassed by the Trump phone call that triggered the first impeachment, and Democrats are embarrassed by Hunter Biden and Burisma. Mr. Zelensky seems kind of on his own, sitting on top of one of the world’s flashpoints. China has been sweetly reaching out.
Reporter Jonathan Swan asked the president how he felt as he saw the Capitol stormed. “Shocked,” Mr. Zelensky said. “I could not even imagine something like this was possible in the United States of America. . . . We are used to thinking that the U.S. has ideal democratic institutions where power is passed calmly, without war, without revolutions.” Such things happen elsewhere; they’ve happened in Ukraine. “That it could happen in the United States, no one expected that. . . . After something like this, I believe it would be very difficult for the world to see the United States as a symbol of democracy in the world.""
For more than a century we have claimed the mantle of world power, basked in the warm glow of our exceptionalism, and put ourselves forward as an example. When you do that you have responsibilities; you owe something in return. What you owe is the kind of admirable behavior that gives the world something to aim for. On 1/6 they saw the storming and the siege and thought: Ah, no stability in that place. We can’t learn how to do it there and replicate it here. 
This is a loss to rising democracies and also to us, to our standing and reputation. Senate conviction is the chance to show the world: No, we won’t have this; those who did it will pay the highest penalty.
It matters that all evidence be presented, that everyone sees we can come down like a hammer, ensuring that 1/6 was a regrettable incident, not a coming tendency. 
It matters that the world see this. That we see it. 
 
GOP Ohio Sen. Portman not seeking reelection, cites gridlock 
Ohio Sen. Rob Portman said Monday that he won’t seek reelection to a third term in 2022, expressing dismay with the deep partisanship and dysfunction in American politics. 
The career establishment Republican with a reputation for bipartisanship cited a political climate that has made it “harder to break through the partisan gridlock and make progress."" 
""Our country is very polarized,” Portman said, adding that former President Donald Trump did not help with the polarization. “It’s shirts and skins right now. We need to tone it down."" 
The decision is one measure of the difficult politics facing many Republicans in Washington as they cede power in President Joe Biden’s administration and watch their party split between hard-right Trump supporters and others eager to turn the page. Portman, a moderate who might see growing influence as Biden looks for allies, did not appear optimistic about the prospect of a new political climate.
Portman, 65, is among the longtime Republican lawmakers who often backed Trump, though not vociferously. Once dubbed “The Loyal Soldier” in a front-page profile story in his hometown Cincinnati Enquirer, Portman usually defended Trump or avoided criticism of him with carefully worded statements. After Trump called the presidential election rigged, citing no legitimate evidence, Portman said Trump had a right to a probe of any irregularities.
But immediately after the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol by a violent mob of Trump backers, Portman said Trump needed to go on national TV to tell his supporters to refrain from violence. 
""Both in his words before the attack on the Capitol and in his actions afterward, President Trump bears some responsibility for what happened,” Portman said. 
His retirement adds another open seat for the GOP to defend in 2022 as it seeks to regain control of a Senate that Democrats hold by virtue of Vice President Kamala Harris being the tiebreaking vote. Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, two other more mainstream Republicans in the Senate GOP caucus, have also said they won’t seek reelection next year.
""There goes the kind of really thoughtful public official who listens, who works both sides, who tries to get things done,” Republican pollster Christine Matthews said. “And right now the kind of candidate that’s going to come out of a Ohio Republican primary is not going to be that kind of candidate. That’s not the kind of energy that’s in the Republican primary electorate right now.""
Indiana Sen. Todd Young, former chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said he wasn’t worried about moderates fleeing the party. 
""(Portman’s departure) says nothing about the 2022 landscape,” Young said. “It says a lot about Rob Portman that, two years out, he made the announcement so that Republicans have plenty of time to field a very strong candidate and to give that candidate sufficient time to run a strong campaign, which they will."" 
Eight-term Rep. Jim Jordan, an outspoken Trump supporter from western Ohio, and six-term Rep. Bill Johnson, from heavily pro-Trump southeast Ohio, are viewed as potential candidates for Portman’s seat. Likewise, former Rep. Jim Renacci from central Ohio, a Republican who lost a Senate challenge to Democrat Sherrod Brown in 2018, is also considered a possible contender.
Portman’s announcement came the same day that the Senate is receiving the House impeachment article against Trump for his role in the Capitol riot. While some Republican senators have criticized going ahead with the trial with Trump out of office, Portman said last week that he would listen to the evidence presented by both sides before deciding how to vote.
Republicans have 20 seats up for reelection in 2022, compared to 14 for Democrats. Those GOP seats include presidential battlegrounds Wisconsin, where Trump narrowly lost in November, and Florida, where he won by more than 3 percentage points.
Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson has not yet said whether he’ll seek a third term. Meanwhile, six-term Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, who would turn 89 two months before the 2022 election, said he would decide this year whether to seek a seventh. Two-term Missouri Republican Roy Blunt has not said whether he’ll seek a third.
Ohio, a perennial battleground for decades, has become more reliably Republican, carried by Trump by more than 8 percentage points in 2016 and 2020. Portman, like many mainstream GOP lawmakers viewed as insufficiently supportive of Trump, was considered likely to face a primary challenge from the right.
""Yeah, sure, some people are mad at him,” said Ohio Republican strategist Ryan Stubenrauch. “But he wouldn’t have faced a credible primary challenge. He does his job. He’s a really good campaigner and well known across the state.""
Portman twice won election to the Senate by wide margins. Before that, he served seven terms in the House and a stint as President George W. Bush’s budget director. 
Still, Portman’s departure offers a glimmer of hope for Democrats in the state. Besides Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, most other statewide officials are Republican. 
Tim Ryan, a 10-term Democratic representative from blue-collar eastern Ohio who ran unsuccessfully for the 2020 presidential nomination, said Monday that he is weighing a Senate campaign. “I haven’t made a decision yet but I’m looking seriously at it,” he wrote on Twitter.
Likewise, Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley, a rising star who lost a 2018 primary for governor, said she is weighing a Senate bid. “I’ve gotten a lot of encouragement, especially today, and will make my decision in the coming weeks,” Whaley told The Associated Press.
Portman’s first federal government job started in 1989, when he served as an associate legal counsel in the George H.W. Bush White House. Portman considered Bush a mentor, one whose genteel style was far from that of the abrasive Trump and some of his Republican supporters in Washington
Portman was elected to Congress from southern Ohio in a 1993 special election and won six more elections before President George W. Bush tapped him to serve as U.S. trade representative in 2005. He traveled the globe, negotiating dozens of trade agreements. Bush then nominated him to be White House budget director in 2006.

Peak Democratic Hypocrisy: Call for Unity, Then Impeach
I stood by our Constitution and voted NO on Wednesday's article of impeachment.

For my thoughts on the Democrats’ decision to impeach the President for a second time, one week before he leaves office, and the divisiveness it sows in America, please read my Op-Ed below.

Discussing the Democrats' Renewed Impeachment Push
 The Left has a short memory when it's convenient, but America doesn't.

We remember the violence inflicted by BLM and radical anarchists in 2020 just like we remember how Democrats and the liberal media labeled the acts as “mostly peaceful” and REFUSED to condemn them.

The hypocrisy never ends.

The Best Rescue Package Is Opening Up the Economy
Here’s Joe Biden’s first attempt at running the country – taking credit for coming up with ideas that President Donald Trump ALREADY signed into law.

The best stimulus/rescue package is opening up the economy.

Americans don’t want to depend on government handouts – they want to go back to work!

Reacting to the Second House Impeachment Vote
It took Speaker Pelosi MONTHS to put forward a COVID-19 relief package that could’ve directly helped YOU, but somehow got a bill ready to impeach the President in a matter of days? Give me a break.

An Absolute Disgrace to Reporting Everywhere

Facts Matter
Well color me surprised: not everyone who rioted in the Capitol was a Trump supporter.

This Week's Impeachment Was Purely Political
This impeachment is purely about political posturing and a catchy CNN headline – it’s a disgrace.

Our 240-plus years of proud history and those who died to ensure America was victorious through its many trials deserve better than the mockery that unfolded before us this week in Congress.

Democrats Are Now Silent on Breaking Up Big Tech
Democrats used to be supportive of breaking up Big Tech but now, are silent. Why? Could it be because the censorship benefits them?

No matter your political party – this authoritarian-style rule ends well for no one. We must reject it.

12/4/20 17:43,"Thank you, Officer Johnson","Dear West Virginian,  Our state has been devastated after learning that Charleston Police Officer Cassie Johnson was killed in the line of duty after responding to a parking violation. Police officers like Officer Johnson selflessly put their lives on the line every day for the safety of our communities. It’s a hard job and one that is rarely appreciated enough. I ask that that we all take a minute today and every day to thank our law enforcement and recognize the sacrifices they make to ensure our communities are safe and protected.  I spoke with Officer Johnson’s mother on the phone on Thursday, and she repeated her daughter’s commitment to organ donation. Even in Cassie’s tragic death, others will live because of her. What a testament to an amazing woman.   I paid tribute to Officer Johnson on the floor of the Senate, ensuring her name is escribed on the annals of history:     Please continue to keep Officer Johnson’s family, the Charleston Police Department, and all of Charleston in your prayers.  Supporting the West Virginia National Guard   The West Virginia National Guard has been an invaluable asset for our state as we continue to battle the coronavirus pandemic. As we begin preparation to distribute a vaccine, we should continue to support their efforts. That’s why I asked President Trump to extend Title 32 orders. On Thursday, President Trump announced that he would be extending the orders through March 2021. This is great news. This extension will allow our National Guard the support they need and benefits for the vital work they are performing in our communities during this difficult time.  Read more in this article from WVNews:   
The Best and Brightest  Every year, I have the privilege of nominating high school students to attend the U.S. Service Academies. I’m pleased to announce this year, I’ve nominated 31 students from 11 counties to represent our state. You can read all of their names here.  For all of these students—high school seniors especially—I recognize this isn’t the school year they were expecting. However, I hope this announcement is a bright spot. These students have adapted to the circumstances and made the most of their year. I know they will continue to exude that West Virginia spirit in this next chapter of their lives.  For more information on the Academy Nomination process, visit my website here.  Play Ball!  On Monday, I applauded Major League Baseball (MLB) and Prep Baseball Report (PBR) in their announcement of a new format for the New York/Penn League, which will feature MLB-draft eligible players. One of the founding members of this league will be in Morgantown—The West Virginia Black Bears.  The Black Bears being able to keep playing baseball is great news for all of West Virginia. It goes without saying that Morgantown offers so many assets, from the facilities, existing partnerships with the community, and wonderful fans who enjoy watching baseball on West Virginia summer nights. When it was announced that the Black Bears were rumored to be on the list to be eliminated as an MLB affiliate, I worked constantly to make sure we had a suitable way to be able to keep playing baseball and this opportunity allows them to do so. Learn more about the details of the announcement here.  Additional COVID-19 Resources  I created a page on my website with information and resources to keep you up-to-date on the coronavirus situation as it continues to evolve.

5/21/21 19:55,Serving You,"Dear Friend,

I hope you had a great week and are looking forward to the weekend! I had a busy week in Congress fighting for you. Here are the highlights:

Standing in Solidarity with the AAPI Community
 

Hate against any group of people has no place in our country. Unfortunately, we saw nearly 4,000 reported incidents of hate crimes targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders over the past year. This is abhorrent and not reflective of the country that welcomed my family and me into its fabric.  

I’m glad that this week, Congress came together to pass a bipartisan bill to help local, state and federal law enforcement agencies better address hate crimes. This bill is an important step in the right direction. However, we also cannot legislate hate out of our hearts and minds. Each of us has a personal responsibility to treat one another with respect. I will continue to do my part. 

Honoring Placentia First Responders
 

First responders are heroes who put their lives on the line each day to serve our communities. My team was honored to join the Placentia Chamber of Commerce and local government leaders at the annual First Responders Recognition Breakfast to honor our Placentia Fire and Police, Placentia Safety Communications Center and EMS Services. 

On behalf of CA-39, our community honors Police Officer Selena Hurtado and Civilian Investigator Andrea Heinzel, Fire Engineer James Banister, Paramedic Louie Grijalva, EMTs Corey Ellison and Joshua Hammond and Public Safety Communications Manager Stefanie Acosta-Reyes.

Thank you to these outstanding public servants for all you do for the City of Placentia and CA-39!

Hearing From You During My Telephone Town Hall
 

Thank you to everyone who joined my telephone town hall on Tuesday! We discussed a wide range of issues, such as the need to secure our border and fix our broken immigration system, get people back to work, support small business owners and workers, lower taxes, address homelessness in California, support the police and more. 

If you did not receive a call this week, please call my office to voice your concerns and provide your contact information so you can join my next telephone town hall. I want to make sure that anyone who wants to join my telephone town hall is able to participate. My team and I are here to serve you and want to hear from you always.

Working in a Bipartisan Way to Deliver Results for CA-39
 

I came to Congress to get through the partisan gridlock and create commonsense policies that deliver results for CA-39. I'm proud that my record in Congress ranks the most bipartisan out of my freshman class. I'm also excited that I have been able to get four of my bills passed by the House and one signed into law by the president. I assure you I am just getting started, and I’ll continue to do all I can to work with members from both sides of the aisle to get things done. 

Strengthening our US-ROK Partnership
 

South Korea is one of our most important allies and an important partner in countering shared threats posed by North Korea.

I was honored to join a bipartisan meeting with South Korean President Moon Jae-in this week to discuss strengthening our bilateral partnership. This week, I also outlined my thoughts on US-Korea priorities in the Washington Examiner and introduced the bipartisan Partner with Korea Act which will strengthen greater investment in American businesses. I will always fight for our nation’s interests on the House Foreign Affairs. 

Increasing Oversight of COVID-19 Relief Programs
 

After more than a year of dealing with unprecedented shutdowns and restrictions, small businesses across CA-39 and nationwide are finally reopening and safely getting back to work. For many entrepreneurs, the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) emergency relief programs, including the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) program, have been a critical lifeline to keep their doors open.

Congress has a duty to ensure the SBA manages relief programs properly and make sure taxpayer dollars are spent effectively. Waste, fraud and abuse must be prevented, so relief goes to those who need it most, and our hard-earned tax dollars are not wasted.  

Protecting American Workers
 

As our nation emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic, we must do all we can to support families and small businesses getting back on their feet after over a year of dealing with pandemic restrictions. The last thing Congress should be doing as we get our economy back on track is passing bills like the PRO Act, which would implement many of the disastrous policies of AB 5 nationwide. 
 
We must support small businesses and Americans returning to work, especially as we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. I hope that the Biden Administration and Congressional leaders talk to California workers and families impacted by anti-worker polices of AB 5 so we can finally deliver solutions that will better the lives of all Californians and Americans.

Creating a More Efficient State Department
 

Our country deserves to have the best tools to achieve our goals worldwide. Currently, diplomats and foreign service officers have to complete duplicative training and reporting requirements. This has made the State Department less responsive to international events and less prepared to meet the 21st Century’s global challenges.

The House passed my bill to reform and modernize the State Department as part of the bipartisan Department of State Authorization Act of 2021. My bill will streamline and improve State Department reporting requirements and ensure employees participate in educational programs to grow their skillsets to better work for the American people. I look forward to my bill being swiftly passed by the Senate.  

Securing Our Border and Fixing Our Broken Immigration System
 

Drug cartels are the only ones benefiting from the security, humanitarian and public health crisis at our Southern border. It’s hurting Americans, straining our resources including of our border patrol and Customs and Border Protection officers on the front lines, endangering migrants who are making the perilous journey to the U.S. in search of a better life, and undermining legal immigration.   

The Biden administration must acknowledge the crisis and visit the border firsthand to talk with border patrol, law enforcement, mayors, judges and others on the front lines. This is no longer just a border issue; it's an American issue. We cannot fix the problem if we do not recognize there is a problem. I will do my part to secure our border and allow for fair, legal immigration.




Celebrating Asian Pacific American Heritage Month

 
 

May is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month! Throughout this month, we recognize the countless Asian Americans who have broken barriers and are making our communities, country and world a better place. I’m proud to represent so many Asian Americans who are making a difference throughout our community.

Follow along on my social media @RepYoungKim as we highlight a few of the amazing leaders across the nation who have paved the way and are blazing trails for future generations.

5/26/21 20:08,Health tips and updates for North Texas,"News from Representative Allred
 
May 26, 2021 
 Dear Friend, 
As we get ready to unofficially kick off summer in North Texas this Memorial Day weekend, here are some helpful tips and reminders about keeping yourself and your family safe. 

It’s so important that every Texan get vaccinated to help us beat this virus, and you can now text your zip code to GETVAX (438829) in English or to VACUNA (822862) in Spanish to immediately receive addresses of nearby available vaccination centers.  Uber and Lyft are providing free rides to vaccination sites. 

  It is important that you and your family have health insurance and access to a doctor, especially as we are still facing a public health crisis. I fought to lower health care costs and expand access to health insurance as part of the American Rescue Plan, which was signed into law. As a result, Congress dramatically expanded subsidies to help millions of folks afford coverage and now, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the American Rescue Plan will help 1.3 million people without insurance finally get covered.   In addition, the special enrollment period for the health care marketplace has been extended to August 15, 2021, giving more North Texans a chance to get quality health insurance during this critical time. Folks who aren’t currently covered, or simply want to change plans to save money, should visit HealthCare.gov to select a plan that works for them.  Read an article I wrote in the North Dallas Gazette on how the American Rescue Plan is helping North Texans get medical coverage during the pandemic. You can also check out my article in the Dallas Weekly on why Texas should expand Medicaid and how I’m fighting to make that happen to provide health care coverage to over a million Texans.  Have questions or need assistance?  My office is here to help you navigate the health care marketplace. Give us a call in Richardson at (972) 972-7949 or start a case online with one of my constituent advocates if you run into any issues.   I will continue to work in Congress to make sure every North Texan can afford health insurance and to lower health care costs across the board for all Americans.

As we celebrate Black History Month over the next few weeks, we will be highlighting New Jerseyans who have made significant contributions to our communities. This week, I wanted to share a conversation on race I had in the fall with former Montclair Deputy Police Chief Roger Terry, his daughter and insurance executive Rhonda Robinson, and his grandson Gary Robinson, Jr., along with Morristown resident Leslie Allen, a former professional tennis player and President & CEO of Win4Life Enterprises.

VALENTINES FOR VETERANS

Last week, we launched our second annual Valentines for Veterans program. Residents are invited to upload a digital message or electronic copy of a hand-written card for veterans in the 11th District through Thursday, February 11th. 
Our veterans have sacrificed so much for our country and this Valentine’s Day is a wonderful opportunity to thank them for their service. Last year, we distributed valentines from students and families across NJ-11 and I know they were greatly appreciated. We are taking the program online this year and encourage all our residents to join us in writing a message. 
The form to submit messages can be found here.

 BLACK HISTORY MONTH SPOTLIGHT:
CONVERSATION ON RACE: SEPTEMBER 2020

I wanted to share the discussion I had this fall with Roger Terry, Rhonda Robinson, Gary Robinson, Jr., and Leslie Allen as we start Black History Month. Both Roger and Leslie are both trailblazers in their fields and have incredible life stories. Discussions about race and community are one step toward building a more equitable and just society, and they help lay a foundation of understanding that is long past due.

EIP AND RECOVERY REBATE CREDIT

Our office has received many inquiries about Economic Impact Payments (EIP). We understand that it has been frustrating for constituents who believe they were eligible for either or both rounds of EIPs but have not received a payment, or have received the incorrect amount. Congress intended these payments to provide immediate relief to individuals and families struggling during the pandemic. My team and I have pressed the IRS to address these problems, continue making eligibility determinations, and issue outstanding payments.
Some of the more common issues highlighted by constituents that would fall into this category include:
	•	Taxpayers whose income was higher in 2018 than 2019 and were determined to be ineligible or eligible for a smaller payment 
	•	Individuals who were claimed as dependents in 2018 but filed on their own in 2019 
	•	Taxpayers who were given a May 22nd payment date but the payment did not arrive 
	•	Taxpayers who now reside at a different address than they did in 2018 or 2019 
	•	Couples who file taxes jointly, but only one person received the $600 2nd round payment 
However, at this point, please be advised that if you did not receive either or both of the Round 1 and Round 2 payments, or if either payment was lower than expected, the IRS has indicated that the best course of action is to claim the amount on your 2020 tax return as a Recovery Rebate Credit. We are disappointed the IRS was not able to issue your payment in time, but also want to make sure you have the information needed to claim your EIP on your upcoming tax return. 
If you did not receive your Economic Impact Payment, or received a lower amount than expected, please take the following steps to claim the funds you are owed:
	•	Confirm the total amount of EIPs you received, either through Notice 1444 and 1444-B or through your bank statements 
	•	Use the Recovery Rebate Credit Worksheet to determine the amount you are owed 
	•	Claim your Recovery Rebate Credit on Line 30 of IRS Form 1040 
 PREPARE and PROTECT LTC Acts
Last Thursday, Rep. Bill Pascrell, Jr., Senator Bob Menendez and I introduced our legislation to restore regulations regarding infection control and emergency preparedness in skilled nursing facilities and nursing facilities.
The Promoting Restoration of Emergency Preparedness and Advancing Response to Epidemics in Long-Term Care Act (PREPARE LTC Act) will require facilities to establish and maintain an infection prevention program and an emergency plan to protect residents during emergency situations. The bill prevents the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services from waiving or suspending staffing reporting and critical inspections during a pandemic. 
Last Friday, Rep. Bill Pascrell, Jr. and I reintroduced our legislation to improve oversight of long-term care facilities and protect seniors and workers. While only 0.5 percent of U.S. residents live in nursing homes, individuals in nursing homes account for more than a third of the nation’s COVID-19 deaths.
The Protecting Residents with Oversight, Transparency, and Enforcement for Compassionate Treatment in Long-Term Care (PROTECT LTC Act) provides $100 million to State Survey Agencies (SAs) to increase investigations and surveys, purchase personal protective equipment, and boost staffing levels. The bill also increases civil monetary penalties for outbreak-specific violations at nursing homes, including staff shortages, overcrowding, and insufficient PPE. 
National Apprenticeship Act
As a new member of the House Education and Labor Committee, I am excited to say I voted on Friday for the bipartisan National Apprenticeship Act to expand the Registered Apprenticeship Program, streamline access for workers and employers, and better protect apprentices. The legislation will help create an estimated one million new apprenticeship positions nationwide over the next five years. 
Apprenticeship programs create opportunities for workers to learn new skills and transition into good-paying jobs. I’ve heard from residents, labor leaders, and educators across North Jersey about how valuable apprenticeship programs are for both workers and employers, and I’m proud to support the expansion of this program with a proven track record of success.
House Global Positioning System (GPS) Caucus 

I announced last week I am joining Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE) as a co-chair of the bipartisan, House Global Positioning System (GPS) Caucus. GPS technology plays an integral part in nearly every aspect of modern society but is also an essential tool for our country’s national security. As a former helicopter pilot for the U.S. Navy, I know first-hand the importance of accurate, reliable, and resilient GPS technology, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to support this critical technology. The Senate GPS Caucus is co-chaired by Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Joni Ernst (R-IA).   

I'm incredibly honored to serve the 11th District and will continue to work hard on the issues that will move New Jersey, and this country, forward.

Holding Washington's Employment Security Department Accountable
 
For some Washingtonians who had their identities stolen to collect benefits from Washington's Employment Security Division, they're being incorrectly told they owe taxes to the IRS on that money.
 
This is unacceptable and must be fixed, which is why I'm pressing ESD to take immediate action to save these fraud victims from additional hassle and financial headaches. Read more here.
 
Under the leadership of Suzi Levine, former Commissioner of the Washington State Employment Security Department (ESD) taxpayers were defrauded of more than $600 million dollars when signs of criminal behavior were missed or ignored. This theft also forced thousands of Washingtonians to go weeks without unemployment assistance. These bogus tax bills are yet another unfortunate chapter in ESD's mistakes during the pandemic. 
 
With this absymal track record, it comes as a shock that the Biden administration would appoint Levine to a National Employment Post. That's why I'm strongly urging President Biden to reconsider Levine's appointment. Millions of Americans who are relying on unemployment benefits cannot risk being negatively affected by Levine's proven poor leadership. Read my full letter to the president here.
  
  
 
Preventing Packing of the U.S. Supreme Court

12/27/20 10:02,The light at the end of the tunnel is here,"THE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL IS HERE

I wrote an article in The Hill this week about the COVID-19 vaccines. As the only pharmacist currently serving in Congress, I understand that these vaccines are record-breaking, unprecedented achievements. The tide is turning against this virus, once and for all.

The light at the end of the tunnel is here

I’ve always said I can endure anything as long as I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Thankfully, the light at the end of tunnel for the coronavirus pandemic is here.

On Dec. 11, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the first COVID-19 vaccine in the United States from Pfizer-BioNTech. As the only pharmacist currently serving in Congress, I understand that this record-breaking, unprecedented achievement is nothing short of a miracle. The tide is turning against this virus, once and for all.

With the help and support of the federal government through Operation Warp Speed (OWS), Pfizer-BioNTech followed by Moderna were able to bring safe and effective vaccines to market in less than a year from the time Chinese scientists released the virus’ genome.

So, how was it done so quickly? The answer — a public-private partnership unlike any before it, led by President Trump’s OWS initiative. Under the president’s leadership, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the FDA, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) worked tirelessly with the private sector to plan and assist with the costs of designing vaccines, staging clinical testing, and reviewing data on the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness.

These efforts resulted in some of the safest and most effective vaccines ever created. Preliminary data shows the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines to be more than 95 percent effective after two doses. In comparison, the flu vaccine is, at best, 60 percent effective in any given year. Both companies have reported very limited side effects for their COVID-19 vaccines including potential short-term pain at the site of injection, fatigue, and headaches — very similar side effects to the flu vaccine.

I am so confident in the safety and effectiveness of these vaccines that I participated in a double-blind placebo trial for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine myself. I recently learned that I received the vaccine during the trial, cementing my confidence in the vaccine.

America has the greatest scientific minds in the world. We have the gold standard of approval set by the FDA, a standard that every other country uses for guidance and direction. This should give every American confidence that these vaccines are completely safe and effective.

Now that vaccines have been approved, the next challenge is ensuring every American who wants to be vaccinated can be in the next several months. President Trump was able to secure distribution contracts for the delivery of the Moderna vaccine throughout the country, while Pfizer is working with the CDC and OWS to deliver their vaccines using their own logistical resources.

Most Americans will need to wait a few months before they can receive the vaccine. At the advice of the CDC, most states have enacted immunization plans that involve vaccinating health care workers first, followed by nursing home residents and employees. The general public will follow, with an emphasis on those with pre-existing conditions and comorbidities.

The head of OWS, Moncef Slauoi, has stated they expect nearly 100 million Americans to be vaccinated within the next 100 days. They estimate roughly 20 million in December, 30 million in January, and 50 million in February. This means that nearly 1/3 of our entire country can be vaccinated in just three months.

We are nearing the end of this vicious virus.

As a pharmacist, health care professional, and vaccine trial participant, I would strongly encourage every single American to seriously consider receiving the vaccine when it becomes available to you.

Vaccines are the single most life-saving innovation ever in the history of medicine. The COVID-19 vaccines will be no exception.

We can only defeat this virus if we work together by receiving the immunization, wearing a mask, washing your hands, and social distancing.

America has been tested time and time again, yet we always come out on the other end stronger. I have no doubt that this pandemic will be no different.

We will beat this virus, and we will be stronger, together, because of it.

For Immediate Release
December 17, 2020


REPRESENTATIVE ADRIANO ESPAILLAT INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO HELP PROVIDERS RECEIVE, STORE, AND DELIVER mRNA COVID-19 VACCINES

The COVID-19 Cold Storage Expansion Act of 2020 Allows Providers to be Reimbursed for Costs of New Storage Equipment to Meet CDC Recommendations


WASHINGTON, DC – Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) released the following statement with the introduction of his legislation, the COVID-19 Cold Storage Expansion Act of 2020: 

“With the planned meeting this week and next week by the Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee reviewing the safety and efficacy of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA COVID-19 vaccine candidates, we need to make sure that all willing providers are able to receive, store, and deliver these COVID-19 vaccines if approved,” said Rep. Adriano Espaillat (NY-13). “The COVID-19 Cold Storage would allow providers who complete and sign the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) COVID–19 Vaccination Program Provider Agreement to be reimbursed for the costs of purchasing new equipment that would meet the specific standards as recommended by the CDC. 

“Allowing more providers to be registered in their city, state, and region to receive and administer these mRNA vaccines will be a critical part of the wider vaccination campaign that must occur to successfully combat this COVID-19 virus,” Espaillat continued. “While the priority in the near term will be vaccination of frontline health care workers, elderly residents of nursing homes and long-term care facilities and essential workers, this legislation will benefit all cities and regions as the wider vaccination campaigns begin in 2020 and continue into 2021.”

CONGRESISTA ADRIANO ESPAILLAT INTRODUCE LEGISLACIÓN PARA AYUDAR A LOS PROVEEDORES A RECIBIR, ALMACENAR Y ENTREGAR VACUNAS mRNA CONTRA EL COVID-19

La Ley de Expansión de Almacenamiento en Frío COVID-19 de 2020 permite que los proveedores sean reembolsados por los costos de nuevos equipos de almacenamiento para cumplir con las recomendaciones de los CDC


WASHINGTON, DC – El congresista Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) emitió la siguiente declaración sobre la introducción de su legislación, Ley de Expansión de Almacenamiento en Frío COVID-19 de 2020:

“Con la reunión planificada para esta semana y la próxima por el Comité Asesor de Vacunas y Productos Biológicos Relacionados que revisa la seguridad y eficacia de los candidatos a suministrar vacunas mRNA contra el COVID-19 Pfizer/BioNTech y Moderna, debemos asegurarnos de que todos los proveedores dispuestos puedan recibir, almacenar y entregar estas vacunas contra el COVID-19 si se aprueban”, dijo el Rep. Adriano Espaillat (NY-13). “La Ley de Almacenamiento en Frío de la vacuna contra el COVID-19 permitiría a los proveedores que completen y firmen el Acuerdo de Proveedores del Programa de Vacunación contra el COVID-19 de los Centros para el Control de Enfermedades (CDC) recibir un reembolso por los costos de compra de equipos nuevos que cumplan con los estándares específicos recomendados por los CDC.

“Permitir que más proveedores se registren en su ciudad, estado y región para recibir y administrar estas vacunas mRNA será una parte fundamental de la campaña de vacunación más amplia que debe ocurrir para combatir con éxito este virus COVID-19”, continuó Espaillat. “Si bien la prioridad a corto plazo será la vacunación de los trabajadores de atención médica de primera línea, los ancianos residentes de hogares de ancianos e instalaciones de atención a largo plazo y los trabajadores esenciales, esta legislación beneficiará a todas las ciudades y regiones a medida que las campañas de vacunación más amplias comiencen en 2020 y continúen en 2021"".

This week, our state reached a heartbreaking milestone when the thousandth Granite Stater lost their life to COVID-19.  The virus has taken too many too soon, and my prayers are with every Granite Stater who has lost a loved one. To all who are struggling right now, whether because you have lost a family member, are newly unemployed, or are facing mental health challenges brought on or exacerbated by the pandemic – please know that you are not alone.  As we mourn together as a state, I urge all Granite Staters to continue to support one another, and, even as vaccines become more available, remember that it is still critical that we wear masks and practice social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus and save lives.  I will continue to work with Republicans and Democrats, as well as the Biden administration, to provide the additional health and economic relief that our country needs. I also appreciate that the administration announced this week that it will reopen the Affordable Care Act’s online marketplace – which will help ensure that more Americans have access to affordable health care during the pandemic.  By continuing to work together and following public health guidelines, we can and will get through this. 
With every good wish,     Senator Maggie Hassan 
What the Senator is Working On
Senator Hassan, along with Senators Todd Young (R-IN), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Tim Kaine (D-VA), reintroduced the bipartisan Gateway to Careers Act to help expand economic opportunity for hard-working Americans and support innovative businesses in need of a strong workforce. This bill to support career pathways is the first bill Senator Hassan introduced this Congress. Learn more here.  Senator Hassan and Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) introduced a bipartisan bill to support the National Guard’s role in helping state and local governments safeguard  their cybersecurity infrastructure.  Read more here.  New Hampshire breweries applauded bipartisan efforts that Senator Hassan helped lead to permanently extend the reduction in excise taxes for craft breweries in the government funding and COVID-19 relief package. Senator Hassan successfully worked to temporarily extend these tax cuts in the bipartisan government funding bill in 2019 and to permanently extend this tax relief at the end of 2020.

Concord's Christa McAuliffe died alongside six others when the space shuttle Challenger exploded 35 years ago this week. Christa was a teacher and a dreamer who was selected for the NASA Teacher in Space Project. Her goal was to inspire students with her love of learning — and while her life was cut short, that legacy lives on in classrooms throughout New Hampshire and the country.  This week, the Christa McAuliffe Commemorative Coin became available for pre-order. All proceeds will go to the FIRST Robotics program, furthering STEM education. Senator Hassan joined Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Mike Enzi (R-WY) in pushing for this small memorial to a phenomenal woman.

Americans and our small businesses urgently need additional COVID-19 relief, and they need it now.  I am part of a bipartisan group of Senators and members of the House of Representatives that put together a key package that provides significant support for individuals, small businesses, public health, and schools. We came together, compromised, and found bipartisan agreement on a response that will help protect lives and livelihoods and provide critical support during some of the most dire months of this pandemic.  Our agreement jumpstarted Congressional negotiations and now Congressional leadership is negotiating a relief bill that uses our framework.  Earlier this week, I met with long-term care providers in New Hampshire who are doing everything that they can to keep their patients and residents safe, but are struggling with a number of challenges and need additional support. Nursing homes, hospitals, small businesses, students, and families across the country cannot wait any longer for additional relief.  The people of our country simply cannot afford any more delays, and Congress should not adjourn until an agreement is passed.  In addition, as Congress works to pass a government funding bill, I am continuing to push for other priorities that are critical to Granite Staters. I have been working across the aisle to end the absurd practice of surprise medical billing, and this week I led a group of Senators in calling for a bipartisan agreement to end surprise billing to be included in the year-end funding bill. You can read our letter here. 
In the coming days, I will continue to push on a bipartisan basis for Congressional leadership to get legislation that will provide Americans with vital support across the finish line.

The latest news and updates from Congresswoman Beth Van Duyne

January 25, 2021

Dear Friend,

Much has changed in our country over the last week. On Wednesday, just as we have done for many generations, we witnessed the peaceful transition of power from one administration to the next. Like many of you, I was relieved to see that the inauguration remained peaceful, and I'm grateful for our brave National Guard and Capitol Police who managed such a large event with high risks.

As the 117th Congress moves into a new phase of legislating and doing the work we were elected to do, I'm committed to working with everyone and anyone – Republican, Democrat, Independent – to get things done for the people of North Texas. Our country is tired of the partisan gridlock. It's time to negotiate meaningful change for the American people.

On Wednesday, I led a number of my House Republican freshmen colleagues in sending a letter to President Biden congratulating him on the start of his presidency and pledging to work together on a number of bipartisan issues, including protecting Americans with pre-existing conditions, strengthening and modernizing infrastructure, and restoring the economy in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic.

While I was initially encouraged by President Biden's pledge to be a President for all Americans, I was disappointed that he kicked off his first few days in office by decimating thousands of jobs, hurting working families, and enacting dangerous immigration policies. Last week, I spoke to Neil Cavuto on Fox Business Network about this and more.

North Texas Small Business Tour 

During last week's district work period, I spent much of my time visiting businesses in North Texas and finding out how they are adapting to the challenges of 2021. We have hundreds of thriving small businesses across the district, and each plays a vital role in our community.



It was great meeting with the President of Atmos Energy to discuss their efforts to prioritize safety and work with their customers to ensure no one is without gas during the pandemic. I appreciate their dedication to our communities, and I look forward to working with them on energy solutions.



Thank you to 6 Stones for allowing me to visit their New Hope Center this week. 6 Stones serves over 300 local families each week through clothing and food assistance. Executive Director Jennifer Leney is passionate about community revitalization, and North Texas is better because of their work.



I enjoyed meeting with Trinity Lakes Development and hearing about their plans for a mixed-used development in the heart of our district. We look forward to welcoming the families who make North Texas their home!


Tri-County COVID-19 Vaccine Briefing Tour

We must do everything we can to open our economy back up while protecting the health and safety of our citizens, and ensuring every American who wants a vaccine can receive a vaccine is a critical component of achieving that goal.

Last Friday, I visited Tarrant, Denton and Dallas Counties to meet with local leaders and tour COVID-19 vaccination sites. Local leaders have truly risen to the challenge and set up the infrastructure needed to vaccinate thousands of people daily, and now we need to work on any delays in manufacturing and distribution.

I appreciate leaders like Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price, County Judge Andy Eads and Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson taking their time to meet with me.

To learn more about our COVID-19 vaccine briefing tour, watch NBC 5 News's coverage.

2/6/21 9:30,Rushing A Budget Reconciliation,"Congressman Smith's E-news: February 6, 2021  


This week I had the privilege of attending the annual National Prayer Breakfast virtually.

Rushing A Budget Reconciliation

Budget reconciliation is a longstanding tool intended to provide an expedited track for making changes to federal law relating to long-term budgeting. The primary purpose of reconciliation is to allow budget-related policies to pass through the Senate with a simple majority, without the need to reach a 60-vote majority to end debate. It has been used regularly under majorities in both parties to change tax policy, enact spending cuts, and to implement policies like welfare reform. 

While this tool is intended to make budgeting easier, implementation of policy changes as dramatic as what comes from a reconciliation cannot, and should not, be rushed. But this is exactly what Congressional Democrats are doing. Rather than working across the aisle to establish a proper budget with long-term goals, Democrats are speeding toward using reconciliation in two ways never intended – to enact short term spending policy and to implement new non-budget federal mandates.

Democrats are using reconciliation to move forward with President Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. In the fight against COVID-19, there is no doubt Americans are in need of assistance. However, many of the measures within President Biden’s package, like the $15 per hour minimum wage, are both economically harmful and budgetarily non-germane. With the hospitality industry and small businesses everywhere struggling to stay afloat, it is preposterous to think now is the time to increase the hourly minimum wage to $15. This measure is not part of the federal budget and should not be included in budget reconciliation.

I also have serious concerns about the rush to move President Biden’s coronavirus relief package when there is still roughly $1 trillion of stimulus money that remains unspent. While we may need to move additional resources into major needs like vaccine distribution, we should have a more thorough analysis of available funds and how they can be used to meet our most pressing needs before we consider spending another nearly $2 trillion. This week I wrote to President Biden asking for a more thorough accounting of outstanding funds. According to the last available estimate from December, there is still $280 billion for the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, $29 billion for agriculture, $58 billion for state and local aid, $239 billion for health spending, and $59 billion in education funding that remains unused.

The Democrat push for budget reconciliation is nothing short of a push for their own wish list. We should be focused on real solutions which would utilize allocated funds for coronavirus relief, get teachers and students back in the classroom, and establish a more proportional vaccine distribution strategy. Now more than ever Americans need targeted relief, not a partisan budget gimmick.

4/29/21 17:36,April Updates from DC and the District,"Good afternoon. I would like to provide a few updates about recent developments in Congress and share some important information.
Endless Frontier Act
I partnered with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Senator Todd Young (R-IN), and Representative Mike Gallagher (R-WI) to introduce the Endless Frontier Act. This bill is a bold initiative to advance and solidify the United States’ leadership in scientific and technological innovation through increased investments in the discovery, creation, and manufacturing of technology critical to U.S. national security and economic competitiveness.
Specifically, the Endless Frontier Act will expand the National Science Foundation (NSF) by creating a new Technology and Innovation Directorate within NSF to advance research and development in 10 key technology focus areas, including artificial intelligence, semiconductors, quantum computing, advanced communications, biotechnology, and advanced energy. The Technology and Innovation Directorate would receive $100 billion over five years to invest in basic and advanced research, commercialization, and education and training programs in technology areas critical to national leadership. An additional $10 billion would be authorized at the Department of Commerce to support regional technology strategies and to designate at least 10 regional technology hubs across the country as global centers for the research, development, entrepreneurship, and manufacturing of new key technologies.
The Endless Frontier Act would also establish a new Supply Chain Resiliency and Crisis Response Program with the mission of strengthening critical technology supply chains in the U.S. and with global allies and partners. Additionally, the bill invests in U.S. manufacturing innovation and competitiveness with over $2.4 billion in funding to enhance and expand the Manufacturing USA network for key technologies. To support the country’s national security capabilities, the bill mandates a strategy on national competitiveness and ingenuity in science, research, and manufacturing to support the national security strategy.
The era of endless wars should come to a close and, in its place, we must embark upon a 21st century full of mass investment in scientific discovery & technological innovation. This bicameral, bipartisan legislation is the first step towards making that future a reality for our country.
Earth Day Hearing with Greta Thunberg
On Earth Day, April 22nd, I held my first hearing as Chairman of the Oversight and Reform Subcommittee on the Environment, which was also the first hearing Congress has ever held on the role of fossil fuel subsidies in preventing action on the climate crisis. Climate experts and advocates, Greta Thunberg, Tara Houska, Joseph Aldy, Peter Erickson, Jill Antares Hunkler, and Frank J. Macchiarola, testified before the subcommittee. 
During this landmark hearing, we discussed the dire health and economic impacts of fossil fuel subsidies and why the Biden Administration, and the rest of the international community, should fulfill their commitments to repeal fossil fuel subsidies. Also, we examined how federal subsidies for the fossil fuel industry disproportionately affect already vulnerable communities.
The United States is the largest oil and gas producer in the world, and under the Trump administration, the fossil fuel industry received between $10.4 billion and $15.2 billion in direct relief from the federal government. We must stop spending our tax dollars to enrich wealthy corporate polluters. It is long past time we invest in the health and well-being of our planet and our communities.
End the Blockade of Yemen
I sent a letter to the Biden Administration calling for the immediate end to the Saudi-led blockade on Yemen. I, along with Debbie Dingell (MI-12), and Mark Pocan (WI-02) led 76 of our House colleagues in pressing the Biden administration to use all available leverage with Saudi Arabia to demand an end to the blockade, which has been a leading driver of Yemen’s humanitarian crisis. It has contributed to shortages of fuel, food, water, electricity, and transportation. According to the United Narions, as many as 400,000 Yemeni children under the age of 5 could die from acute malnutrition this year if the Saudi-led war and blockade continues.
We ask that the Biden Administration publicly pressure Saudi Arabia to lift the blockade and guarantee that humanitarian and commercial imports can freely enter Yemen. Every day we allow the blockade to continue is another day that pushes more children to the brink of death. Furthermore, we must push for a comprehensive political settlement that brings this disastrous conflict to a permanent end.  
Updates in the District
I had the opportunity to meet with many of you, both virtually and in-person, to get an update on vaccine distribution, Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) hate, and more. I understand that there has been some frustration with the COVID vaccine distribution, and I assure you that I will continue working closely with our federal, state, and local officials to improve the process so that everyone who wants to be vaccinated can be. Getting our community vaccinated is the surest way to help our struggling small businesses and ensure an equitable recovering from this economic crisis.
Also, I was encouraged to hear so many in our community speaking out against Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) hate. COVID-19 has already devastated our public health and our economy, we cannot add to the suffering by allowing misguided fear, blame and hatred harm our community even more. All forms of racism and bigotry against the AAPI community must stop. 
As always, my district staff continues to prioritize constituent services and federal agency casework. We will work diligently to find the best pathways to resolve your issues with federal agencies, including U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.
Facebook Live Town Halls
Thank you to all who participated in this month’s Facebook Live town hall. In May, I will host a Facebook Live town hall on May 17th at noon Pacific. Please be sure to follow me on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram @RepRoKhanna.

Withdrawing from Afghanistan
In my Washington Post op-ed with Senator Bernie Sanders, we applaud President Biden’s decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan by September 11, 2021. Senator Sanders and I see this as an essential first step towards ending “forever wars,” and an opportunity to refocus American foreign policy to emphasize diplomacy over military action.

Thank you for reading this important e-newsletter. To ensure you are getting updates from our office, please click here to subscribe. If you are already subscribed, please click here to ensure we have your updated information.  
Dear Neighbor, 
In March, President Biden signed the much-needed American Rescue Plan that my fellow House Democrats and I worked tirelessly to pass so that the many folks struggling in this pandemic would be given access to some new and expanded resources. Below you will find a listing of some of the most important resources available to you and your loved ones.  
THE AMERICAN  RESCUE PLAN BOOSTED FUNDING, EXPANDED ACCESS TO COVID-19 VACCINES & Testing 
As a result, COVID-19 vaccines are still being shipped and distributed throughout the state, county and district. Currently, as supplies allow, all people aged 16 and up are eligible to receive a vaccine. 
More information about vaccines, where to get one, and other resources are available on the State of Michigan’s Coronavirus page: Michigan.gov/COVIDVaccine. 
Free COVID-19 tests are still available at locations across Wayne County. To locate a testing facility near you, visit the State of Michigan’s website at michigan.gov/coronavirustest or call the COVID-19 Hotline at 888-535-6136, press 1.  
AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ECONOMIC IMPACT PAYMENTS (EIP) & CHILD TAX CREDIT (CTC) 
Eligibility  
If you are a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien, you are eligible for the full amount of the third Economic Impact Payment. If you (and your spouse if filing a joint return) are not a dependent of another taxpayer and have a valid Social Security number (see exception when married filing jointly) and your adjusted gross income (AGI) on your tax return does not exceed: 
	•	$150,000 if married and filing a joint return or if filing as a qualifying widow or widower;
	•	$112,500 if filing as head of household; or
	•	$75,000 for eligible individuals using any other filing statuses, such as single filers and married people filing separate returns. 
Payments will be phased out—or reduced—above those AGI amounts. This means taxpayers will not receive a third payment if their AGI exceeds:  
	•	$160,000 if married and filing a joint return or if filing as a qualifying widow or widower;
	•	$120,000 if filing as head of household; or
	•	$80,000 for eligible individuals using other filing statuses, such as single filers and married people filing separate returns. 
Economic Impact Recovery Rebate Credit  
If you haven’t already received it, please know that residents may be eligible for the first and/or second economic impact payment if you were a U.S. Citizen or U.S. permanent resident in 2020 who was not claimed as a dependent for tax year 2020, and have a social security number.   
If qualifying residents did not receive a first or second stimulus payment – or it’s smaller than what you believe to be entitled to – you can claim the proper amount when filing your 2020 tax return under the “Recovery Rebate Credit.”  
A Recovery Rebate credit can be filed on your 1040 or 1040-SR income tax form on Line 30. These forms can also be used by residents that are not typically required to file federal income taxes, but are eligible for a Economic Impact Payment. Residents do not need to take any further action if they received their full Economic Impact Payment in 2020 for themselves or any qualifying child.  
If you don't receive the third Economic Impact Payment or additional payment, or received less than the full amounts this year, you may be eligible to claim the 2021 Recovery Rebate Credit. If you are eligible for the 2021 Recovery Rebate Credit you must file a 2021 tax return next year to claim it.   
 If you need assistance in filing your Recover Rebate Credit, please consult your tax preparer. If you need tax preparation assistance, we hope the following organizations in 13th District Strong will be of help to you and your family:  
	•	Accounting Aid Society (313) 556-1920 
	•	Wayne Metro Community Action Agency-Detroit(313) 388-9799
	•	Wayne Metro Community Action Agency-Out-County(734) 284-6999 
Check the Status of Your EIP 
The IRS will continue to make Economic Impact Payments on a weekly basis. Ongoing payments will be sent to eligible individuals for whom the IRS previously did not have information to issue a payment but who recently filed a tax return, as well to people who qualify for “plus-up” payments. 
Visit irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment. 
Child Tax Credit The first monthly payment of the expanded and newly-advanceable Child Tax Credit (CTC) from the American Rescue Plan will be made on July 15th. CTC payments will be made on the 15th of each month unless the 15th falls on a weekend or holiday. Eligible families will receive a payment of up to $300 per month for each child under age 6 and up to $250 per month for each child age 6 and above. Eligible taxpayers do not need to take any action now other than to file their 2020 tax return if they have not done so.Visit irs.gov/credits-deductions/advance-child-tax-credit-payments-in-2021.

4/12/21 12:37,Meeting Veterans in Montana,"The best way to know how the Department of Veterans Affairs can better serve Montana veterans is to hear directly from Montana veterans. And this week, I was proud to host the leader of VA, Secretary Denis McDonough, in the Treasure State to do just that.
Secretary McDonough and I made our way across Big Sky Country to meet firsthand with as many Montana veterans, veterans advocates, and community leaders as possible. 
In Billings, the Secretary and I stopped by the VA clinic to visit with VA staff working hard to serve our veterans.

In Laurel, we were able to tour the Yellowstone National Cemetery and pay our respects to Montana veterans before heading to Bozeman to visit the local VA clinic and the Montana State University Veterans Center.

From there, we got to visit the newly-opened Southwest Montana Veterans Home in Butte to meet with more Montana veterans, VA staff, and veterans advocates.

We made our way to the Fort Harrison VA Medical Center, and finished up our tour at the Montana Army National Guard Headquarters.

Each day we held a listening session with veterans, VA employees, Veterans Service Organizations, local health care providers and others to discuss how we can improve VA services across Montana. 
We heard firsthand the need to expedite COVID-19 vaccinations, expand health care services for veterans in rural areas, as well as the critical importance of better serving women veterans, supporting Native veterans, improving mental health care, and ensuring we’re delivering COVID-19 relief to those in need as soon as possible.

It was an honor to host Secretary McDonough in Montana and hear straight from the source the best ways we can improve VA services in the Treasure State. 
As Chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I’ll be working with VA to find the best ways to put these ideas into action. Montana veterans swore an oath to this country, and it’s up to us to ensure they receive the benefits and care they’ve earned in return for their service. Time to get to work.
Stay safe and be well.

2/6/21 10:57,Weekly Newsletter,"Dear West Virginian,  This week, I joined nine of my Senate Republican colleagues in offering a targeted COVID-19 relief proposal that people across our country urgently need. On Monday evening, we had the chance to discuss this in more detail with President Biden. Our relief proposal included many shared priorities like:  ·      Increasing funding for production and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine;  ·      Providing economic relief for Americans with the greatest need;  ·      Extending enhanced federal unemployment benefits;  ·      Providing nutrition assistance to help struggling families;  ·      Providing additional assistance for our small businesses;  ·      Getting our children safely back to school and ensuring they can stay open;  ·      Increasing resources for child care.  I discussed this proposal and more this week on FOX News and Bloomberg TV.     To watch one of my interviews, click here or the image above.  However, despite our efforts and the need for COVID-19 relief, Democrats in the Senate chose to use the most partisan method possible to pass a $1.9 trillion budget bill, which included their attempt to provide additional relief for the COVID pandemic. This measure passed without a single Republican vote, and required the Vice President to break a 50-50 tie. Providing COVID-19 relief through this method will take months, when bipartisan agreement could have brought targeted, direct relief to the American people much quicker.  Read more in my full statement here.  Ensuring Transparency and Accountability  This week, the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee had the chance to hear directly from the nominee for U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator, North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Michael Regan.  During the hearing, I focused my questions on the significant impacts overreaching environmental regulations have had on West Virginia’s economy in the past and the need to protect air and water without compromising jobs. I also secured a commitment from Michael Regan to visit states like West Virginia that are directly impacted by the environmental policies—something the Obama-Biden administration neglected to do when it proposed its illegal Clean Power Plan. More details here.      To watch Senator Capito’s opening statement, click here or the image above.  To watch Senator Capito’s first round of questions, click here.  To watch Senator Capito’s second round of questions, click here.  Great News for Raleigh County!  Earlier this week, Senator Manchin and I announced that the Raleigh County Memorial Airport Industrial Park will receive a $3.5 million award from the U.S Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration (EDA) and the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC). This investment is well deserved, and will bring crucial improvements that will help expand airport operations and capabilities.  This has been a project that I have been dedicated to see trough for several years now. In 2019, I hosted ARC’s Tim Thomas in Beckley to show him the importance of this project to the region, and I am so thrilled to see it finally become a reality. None of this would have been possible without the work of local leaders and economic development councils who have been essential in the planning and advocacy for the investment. Click here for more details.  In Case You Missed It  Now that the new Congress is underway, we have hit the ground running and introduced legislation that will have meaningful impact in West Virginia. In case you missed this, check out the links below for the details:  ·      ACCESS Act   ·      Early Educators Apprenticeship Act   ·      Safe Connections Act   ·      Healthy Food Access for All Americans Act   West Virginia Veterans Upward Bound  Do you have a veteran in your life who is looking to pursue higher education opportunities or brush up on their skills? West Virginia Veterans Upward Bound is dedicate to providing service to veterans in our state, and they are currently looking for referrals for their programs. Whether you’re looking to improve your computer skills, financial literacy, complete a new degree, or seek assistance with financial aid, WVVUB is here to help. Learn more here: https://vubwv.org/   Additional COVID-19 Resources  I created a page on my website with information and resources to keep you up-to-date on the coronavirus situation as it continues to evolve. For example, checks and debit cards are on the way to those eligible as a result of the relief package we passed recently. Check out that page here, and please share with friends so they can keep up with the latest.  In addition to my webpage, I also want to make sure you know where to get the latest updates from the medical experts at CDC.gov and West Virginia DHHR.  I will continue doing my best to keep you up to speed on what we are doing here at the federal level to help and other resources that can be useful back at home. I will be posting regular updates on my Facebook and Twitter accounts, so be sure to follow me there.

Supporting Servicemember's Mental Health and Transition to Civilian Life


On Wednesday, Senator Joni Ernst and I introduced bipartisan legislation; The Daniel J. Harvey Jr. and Adam Lambert Improving Servicemember Transition to Reduce Veteran Suicide Act, to support the mental health needs of servicemembers and veterans as they return to civilian life in their local communities.
 
Cpl. Adam Lambert and Lance Cpl. Daniel Harvey were American heroes. We are all well aware of the difficulties many servicemembers have transitioning to civilian life and we owe it to our veterans to help them during this challenging time. It is so important that we continue to end the stigma around mental health treatment and encourage everyone to get help when they need it. This is yet another bipartisan piece of legislation that will honor an Iowa hero and improve mental health in our veteran community.

Bipartisan Action to Help Locate Missing Veterans

This week, Senator Joni Ernst and I joined Rep. Chris Pappas (NH-01) and Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-NH) to introduce the National Green Alert Act of 2021. This bipartisan legislation would establish an interagency committee on the development of “Green Alert” systems that would be activated when an at-risk veteran goes missing. 

We are all familiar with AMBER and Silver Alerts and how effective they are, and it makes sense to have a system to help locate at-risk veterans during a time of need. Making sure that our veterans receive the care they need is one of my top priorities as a Member of Congress. I am proud to join in introducing this reasonable and bipartisan legislation to better serve our veterans.

Weekly Meetings
 

I had a great meeting with Cheryll Jones and Dr. Tom Scholz this week. We discussed the importance of telehealth, child health specialty clinics, and funding for youth with special healthcare needs.

On Tuesday, I had the pleasure of meeting with the Iowa Association of Electric Cooperatives to talk about Iowa’s safe and reliable electric grid that powers the homes of hundreds of thousands of Iowans.
 
 

Recognizing Pella’s Tony Schmitz


On Wednesday, I spoke on the House Floor to recognize Pella’s Tony Schmitz. With his acceptance to the United States Military Academy in West Point, New York, Tony has an incredibly bright future ahead of him and I could not be prouder of his achievements.
 
 

Encouraging Vaccinations

 

This week, I spoke on the House floor on vaccine hesitancy. I spent the last Congressional recess traveling the Second District administering COVID-19 vaccines. I would strongly encourage everyone to get a vaccine as soon as possible to reopen our economy and schools, gather with our loved ones, and stop wearing masks.

4/12/21 18:06,Newsletter: Gimenez urges CDC to end the obsolete Conditional Sail Order,"Last week, I joined Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody as they unveiled a lawsuit against the Biden Administration for their reckless, bureaucratic decisions to punish Florida’s cruise line industry. It is time for the Biden Administration and the CDC to revamp their obsolete Conditional Sail Order. As it stands, it entirely ignores the rapid rate of vaccination across the United States and unfairly singles out the cruise line industry. 


If we are to follow the science and believe in the efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine, then why is the CDC not allowing cruise lines to install mitigation protocols, just like it has allowed airlines, rail companies, ground transportation, hotels, and theme parks?
 
This irresponsible and unscientific decision by federal bureaucrats, who have no concept of what is actually happening in the real world, is deeply hurting South Florida’s economy. The unwillingness of the CDC to adapt its guidelines to the ever-changing nature of the country’s pandemic response unrelentlessly destroys an industry that generates hundreds of thousands of jobs and several billions of dollars to our economy.
 
The Conditional Sail Order has a ripple effect across Florida’s economy. Aside from killing the cruise line industry, it hurts folks who work in cruise ship maintenance. It hurts our airports, which service passengers from all over the country who come to Florida for the cruise. It hurts our hotel workers, our port workers, and all the people in between.
 
Unfortunately for these hardworking Americans feeling the impact of the Conditional Sail Order, these bureaucrats never have to face the reality of a prolonged furlough or have had their job jeopardized by the pandemic.
 
I guarantee if it were their job on the line and had to handle the things hardworking Americans have had to handle in the real world in the face of this pandemic, they would find the solution and rectify this issue immediately.
 
I have had conversations with the CDC. I joined a letter with several of my colleagues asking the CDC what the scientific basis is for this Conditional Sail Order. I sent a letter to the CDC demanding they update their guidelines to include consideration of vaccination and get the cruise lines back in the water. I held conversations with several Members of Congress and local officials who agree that this decision by the CDC is hurting our economy.
 
Time and time again, the CDC has decided to ignore us on this issue. It is time to hold the CDC and this Administration accountable for the damage they are committing against these hardworking Americans and for what they are doing to our local economies.
 
I applaud Attorney General Ashley Moody for filing this lawsuit and Governor Ron DeSantis for backing these efforts.
 
Sincerely,

Gimenez Pens Miami Herald Op-Ed in Support of DREAMers and Securing our Border


Over the weekend, Congressman Carlos A. Gimenez wrote an op-ed in the Miami Herald advocating for Congress to pass a clean bill to extend legal protections for DREAMers – individuals who entered the United States as children through no fault of their own. In the op-ed, Gimenez said it is time to allow DREAMers “to come out of the shadows and continue contributing to our communities without the fear of retribution.” 
 
He also pointed to current legislative proposals in Congress, noting that he joined a number of Republicans in the bipartisan American Dream and Promise Act to extend legal protections for DREAMers. Gimenez said these protections “would allow DREAMers to get a driver’s license, go to school, legally obtain work, own a home, and fully integrate into the country they consider home.”
 
The Congressman also underscored some areas where he disagreed with the bill, saying “[t]he legislation was by no means perfect. No legislation that comes out of a partisan, gridlocked process is perfect, and this legislation is far from the ideal solution.” Gimenez’s opposition includes sections relating to the ban on law enforcement officials from using government databases to identify gang members and the relaxed date-of-entry requirement for individuals eligible for protection.
 
Acknowledging the political reality in the House of Representatives – which is controlled by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats – he urged his colleagues in the Senate to strip legislation of this language and pass a clean bill without “poison pills.”
 
Another key focus area for Gimenez in the op-ed was the need to secure the border. In the op-ed, Gimenez recounted an interaction he had with a Honduran family attempting to illegally enter the country while on a visit to the southern border last month. He writes, “[s]everal weeks ago, I joined Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and several other colleagues in El Paso, Texas, to visit the border. While there, I met a Honduran family with young children. When I asked why they had chosen to make the journey to the United States, they indicated that President Biden’s policies and rhetoric would make it easier for them to be successful in immigrating here illegally.”
 
Gimenez also points to discussions with Customs and Border Protection agents – law enforcement officers tasked with keeping the border safe – that point to President Biden and his administration’s policies and rhetoric as an integral reason of the uptick in illegal border crossing attempts. He also makes note of the importance of extending aid to Latin America, particularly Central America, in order to mitigate the socioeconomic reasons why so many attempt to illegally enter the United States.

Gimenez Visits with Atlas Air


Congressman Carlos A. Gimenez visited with Atlas Air in Miami last week to discuss burdensome regulations currently impacting the cargo industry. Atlas Air, which is one of the largest global cargo companies in the world, maintains a hub at Miami International Airport.
 
Gimenez met with Atlas Air CEO John Dietrich where Dietrich specifically brought up his concerns with “Part 117,” a regulatory statute that increased the required rest period for pilots in between flights. The Atlas Air executive also told Gimenez that generally U.S. regulations are much more cumbersome than regulations placed on European and Asia-based cargo companies, putting American companies at a significant disadvantage.
 
After the meeting, Gimenez said in a tweet, “I will always fight for American companies to be well-positioned to dominate their space. Maintaining America’s competitive advantage against adversaries such as China and Russia is key to safeguarding our prosperity.” 

Gimenez Joins Letter in Support of Cuban Pro-Democracy Program Funding


Last week, Congressman Carlos A. Gimenez joined a letter spearheaded by Florida colleague Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart to President Biden in support of funding for Cuban pro-democracy group funding in the next annual budget.
 
These programs include media platforms such as Radio Marti, to give exiles, refugees, and freedom fighters a platform to counter Castro’s communist propaganda machine with pro-democracy and pro-capitalism messaging.

12/4/20 15:45,Progress on Emergency COVID-19 Relief,"November 30 - December 4, 2020 
    With a continued surge in COVID-19 cases, folks struggling to make ends meet, and small businesses on the brink of closure, Americans are in urgent need of additional relief. Congress must come together to get a deal done. This week, Senator Romney helped lead a large group of colleagues in introducing a bipartisan, bicameral COVID-19 emergency relief framework to help American students, families, businesses, workers, and health care providers. The framework is the result of weeks of member discussions in which Senator Romney has fought for targeted relief to those most in need. The response to the proposal has been encouraging, and the Senator will be engaged in ongoing discussions this weekend to fight for a compromise deal.       The $908 billion proposal includes approximately $560 billion in repurposed funds from the CARES Act, with about $348 billion in new spending – representing a significant departure from prior demands from Democrats for a nearly $2 trillion bill. The framework would include an extension in federal unemployment benefits, relief for struggling small businesses, and critical funding to support vaccine distribution. Senator Romney is also pushing for liability protectionsfrom COVID-19 lawsuits. A breakdown of the framework can be found here.           Full story by Lee Davidson here.

4/2/21 19:26,America Rescue Plan at work in Central Florida,"Dear friends and neighbors, 

The American Rescue Plan is changing the course of the pandemic and delivering real relief to Central Florida’s families. This week, I made countless visits throughout our community to see how our federal investments are making a difference in our district.   

While the American Rescue Plan brings hope back into our community, this is no time to build back to the way things were. This week, President Biden announced a new plan to reimagine and rebuild a new economy. The American Jobs Plan makes critical investments that will create good-paying jobs, rebuild Florida’s infrastructure and boosting the United States’ global competitiveness. Specifically, President Biden’s plan will: 
﻿
	•	Fix highways, rebuild bridges, upgrade ports, airports and transit systems;
	•	Deliver clean drinking water, a renewed electric grid and high-speed broadband to all Floridians; 
	•	Solidify the infrastructure of our care economy by creating jobs and raising wages and benefits for essential home care workers;
	•	Revitalize manufacturing, secure U.S. supply chains, invest in R&D and train Floridians for the jobs of the future; and 
	•	Create good-quality jobs that pay prevailing wages in safe and healthy workplaces while ensuring workers have a free and fair choice to organize, join a union, and bargain collectively with their employers.

Congress is already at work transformational infrastructure package. Together, we will Build Back Better in Central Florida and across the country. 

In the District

Supporting Community Health Centers

 
 

Our Community Health Centers have been critical players in our response to COVID-19. This week, I visited Central Florida Health Care to see how the American Rescue Plan is already helping our community defeat the coronavirus. I was happy to announce that $10.6 million in federal funds are on the way so doctors and nurses can redouble their efforts to get more shots in arms and save more lives! 
 

Restarting Tourism in Central Florida
 

I visited Orlando International Airport to see how our friends at Advent Health are providing COVID-19 testing to travelers and essential airport workers to ensure safe travel. Investments in the American Rescue Plan are already helping to restart tourism in Central Florida! 
 

Feeding Families in Our Community

 
 

Too many Central Florida families face food insecurity because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This week, we helped feed dozens of families in the City of St. Cloud. Our American Rescue Plan is helping our community come together to support our neighbors during this crisis! 
 

Supporting our K-12 Teachers
 

The American Rescue Plan delivered $1 billion to Osceola, Orange and Polk County schools. This week, I hosted a virtual roundtable to see how Central Florida schools are using federal funding to keep students safe and make up for valuable learning time in the classroom. 
 

Talking to Casa Venezuela Orlando about Venezuela TPS

 
 

I was pleased to host a town hall with Casa de Venezuela Orlando to speak about TPS for Venezuelans and answer specific questions regarding the process. For more information or to apply, click here. 
 

Supporting Professional Airline Pilots
 

We visited Kissimmee Aiport to see how Aerostar is providing the highest quality training to Central Floridians. 
 

Standing with Central Florida's African American and Black Community
 

This week, I had a roundtable with African American and Black community leaders to discuss how American Rescue Plan will change the course of the pandemic, deliver immediate relief for hard-hit Black families and small businesses, build a bridge towards economic recovery and reduce poverty in Black communities by 34 percent. 
 

Supporting Airport Workers
 

I met with AFGE TSA workers at the Orlando International Airport to discuss how the American Rescue Plan is helping get workers vaccinated, saving jobs and making travel safer. Glad to see the benefits of the American Rescue Plan being felt right here in Central Florida!

Most of these payments are projected to be sent electronically and received on April 7, 2021. The Get My Payment tool will not be updated until this weekend with information for Social Security and other federal beneficiaries expecting payments next week. 

The IRS continues to review data received for Veterans Affairs (VA) benefit recipients and expects to determine a payment date and provide more details soon. Currently, the IRS estimates that Economic Impact Payments for VA beneficiaries who do not regularly file tax returns could be disbursed by mid-April. VA beneficiary payment information will be available in the Get My Payment tool at a future date.

                                            District Update 

Dear Friend,

This week lawmakers did not convene for legislative activity, but President Biden addressed a sparsely attended joint session of Congress to report on the first 100 days of his administration, and his plans for the future.

I was disappointed that the President did not come clean with the American people about the humanitarian catastrophe that his pro-illegal immigration policies have created along our southern border. Even worse, he offered no plan for how to bring this dangerous and rapidly worsening situation under control.

The speech was also a reality check for many Americans.  After promising repeatedly to seek “unity,” President Biden has instead pursued a radical agenda – one that has sought to divide America along political and racial lines, demonize the men and women of law enforcement, and ignore an alarming wave of crime, violence and lawlessness that is becoming a way of life for many American cities.

On the economic front, the President announced yet another multi-trillion dollar spending proposal that would further expand the bloated federal welfare state – this one with a price tag of some $2 trillion. Yet in the next breath, he blamed the tax reductions approved in 2017 for today’s skyrocketing national debt.

For those of you keeping track, this new spending plan adds to the more than $2 trillion “stimulus” bill the President already signed into law – and the roughly $3 trillion “infrastructure” bill he has already sent up to Congress (which dedicates only around 6 percent of that total to roads and bridges). Taken together, these three proposals alone will cost taxpayers a whopping $7 trillion dollars – and this is before Congress even begins to consider the regular spending bills that fund annual government operations (those will likely cost taxpayers another $4 trillion dollars).

President Biden has promised repeatedly to “Build Back Better,” yet his first acts as President were to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline and strangle the American energy development that our manufacturing sector depends on – killing jobs and hammering Americans with soaring gas prices at the pump.

We also heard the president call for increasing the top marginal income tax rate to nearly 40 percent, and 30 percent hike in the corporate rate – even as millions of American workers, families and businesspeople continue to struggle under the weight of government-imposed lockdowns.  

These policies won’t just squeeze family budgets, they represent a return to the kind of failed high-tax, job-killing, big-spending policies that strangled our economy during the Obama years and exported American jobs and factories to countries like China. 

In short, the last 100 days have not been what many Americans expected, and they have set the tone for an administration that we simply can’t afford. 

I hope we can work together in Congress across party lines in the coming weeks and months to restore some basic checks-and-balances to our government, find ways to address problems like the border crisis, and get serious about expanding opportunity for American families – not the budgets and bureaucracies in Washington, DC.

Thanks for checking in with us this week, and we hope you enjoy this Friday’s edition of the Telegram!

Sincerely,






Tom Tiffany
Member of Congress

Critical Race Theory: Your tax dollars at work 
Telegram readers have seen our updates on some of the troubling steps Democrats on Capitol Hill have taken to polarize America along racial lines. From House Judiciary Committee approval of a “reparations commission,” to a Senator from a neighboring state declaring she would only vote for “minority” nominees, it seems like every day there is some new push to stop treating Americans as unique individuals, and start treating them based on their skin color. The Biden administration now appears headed further down that unfortunate road – and is reportedly planning to spend taxpayer money to inject radical, race-based theories into history class curriculum. This project would indoctrinate our students with the false and inflammatory claim that America’s founding – and even our war for independence from the British Empire – were simply tools to expand slavery. You can read more about this dangerous proposal here.

Equal opportunity challenge filed against race-based USDA program  
Many of you have been keeping an eye on the Agriculture Civil Rights and Equality or ACRE Act, legislation Rep. Burgess Owens and I introduced last month to block a USDA program signed into law by President Biden. The Biden program would provide debt relief to farmers based solely on the basis of race. This week, our efforts got a boost when farmers in multiple states, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Ohio, South Dakota and Texas, challenged the constitutionality of the program. 

Coming soon: Subsidized high-rise apartments in the suburbs? 
A little-known feature of President Biden’s massive “infrastructure” package would take aim at neighborhoods zoned for single-family homes by offering federal money to local governments if they agree to pave the way for construction of high-density apartment blocks in suburbs.  Some of you remember that former President Trump and Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson warned that Democrats would pursue such a plan in a newspaper column last summer. I am opposed to this idea and believe we’d all be a lot better off if Washington, D.C. bureaucrats kept their noses out of local neighborhood planning decisions.

Breaking China’s grip on the WHO 
On Tuesday I joined several of my colleagues in voicing opposition to Taiwan’s continued exclusion from the World Health Organization (WHO).  For years, the WHO has been under Beijing’s thumb, undermining global public health efforts and silencing China’s critics – including Taiwan. Readers may recall that Taiwan tried to alert the WHO about person-to-person transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus back in December of 2019– before the pandemic swept across the globe. Unfortunately, the WHO ignored those warnings to protect Communist China, and we know what happened next.  China’s domination of the WHO is unfair, unwise, and unhealthy – and it needs to come to an end. I’ve long advocated for closer U.S. ties with our friends in Taiwan, and I hope in the coming year we can work across party lines to deepen the friendship between our two nations – and reform the beleaguered WHO. You can listen to my statement on Taiwan’s exclusion from the WHO here.


                          Committee Update
Natural Resources Committee Update 
On Thursday the Natural Resources Committee had a National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands Subcommittee hearing on wildfires. I made the point that the wildfire problem in the western states is primarily a forest management problem. But that isn’t the only negative consequence of poor forest management.  In Wisconsin, timber harvest has been significantly reduced on the Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest (CNNF) over the last thirty years – costing taxpayers a bundle. In fact, it has cost the federal treasury $250 million – exacerbating the budget deficit, reducing wildlife diversity, and killing jobs as mills that depend on the harvests closed their doors. We also see increased risks of fire from the blowdown of mature trees that should have been harvested years earlier in the Diamond Roof area in Langlade, Forest and Oconto Counties. One of the witnesses, invited by the majority, made the claim that “large trees are more fire and drought resistant and store and accumulate more carbon annually than small trees.” This statement is patently incorrect, in fact the older trees get, the rate at which they sequester slows down, and when they die that carbon is released back into the atmosphere. That is why it is important we practice active forest management – not a neglectful “hands-off” policy that leaves forests to become overgrown and packed with dead trees, creating tinderbox conditions that make wildfires more likely.


                            District Update
COVID/Vaccine Update 
Wisconsin continues to see a decline in daily case numbers, with an average of 612 reported cases each day. Hospitalizations remain stable throughout the state, although the North Central HERC region did experience an increase in COVID admissions in the past two weeks. On the variant front, Wisconsin is still seeing significant numbers of B117 (UK) and B1427 (California) being reported throughout the state with 707 and 394 total reported cases respectively.
On the vaccine side, Wisconsin reached 4.3 million doses administered, and nearly 2 million people have received their second dose and are fully vaccinated. Additionally, this week the CDC and FDA lifted their temporary pause on the Johnson & Johnson vaccine following an investigation for reported events of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS). Both the CDC and FDA concluded the benefits of the vaccination far outweigh the risks with only 15 people out of more than 8 million recipients ever showing signs of TTS. They do encourage women under the age of 50 to consider all available vaccine options as TTS has largely been traced to that demographic in clinical settings.   New Studies and Announcements on Masking  This week the CDC also presented new guidance for vaccinated individuals, allowing them to go without masks in most outdoor settings. You can find that guidance here. This announcement leads me into another conversation regarding mask wearing—mask mandates in schools. Many schools throughout the state have begun removing mask mandates in classroom settings, a major milestone in bringing our children back to a state of normalcy.   I also wanted to highlight a study conducted by Baruch Vainshelboim, a clinical exercise physiologist, which shows the negative impacts mask-wearing can have on our health. The research shows mask wearing can raise heart rate and arterial oxygen pressure when worn for more than 60 minutes. Additionally, cloth masks have shown to provide poor filtration and increased moisture retention, which in some cases leads to increased risk of respiratory infection. The most critical point in my opinion was Vainshelboim’s discussion of the psychological and emotional impact of never seeing another person’s mouth in a conversation setting. For our children, this has created a detrimental impact on social development in the classroom that needs to be addressed. It is clear the masks are ready to come off, and Wisconsin students are ready to learn fully face-to-face once again.  

                                  Resources    The USDA continues to make resources and assistance available to agricultural producers and working families to ensure access, safety and stability for food markets and supplies.   Small businesses can also apply for assistance through the Economic Injury and Disaster Loan program. This program provides economic relief to businesses that are currently experiencing a temporary loss of revenue as a result of the pandemic.  If a friend forwarded you this newsletter, and you would like to receive it in the future, you can subscribe here for weekly updates and connect with me on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.   As always, you are welcome to visit my website or to contact my offices in Washington, DC or Wisconsin, which remain open for service, if you have any questions or need assistance.

2/1/21 20:25,Path Forward on Bipartisan COVID Relief,"A message from US Senator Todd Young
 


Path Forward on Bipartisan COVID Relief
Tonight, I was part of a group of 10 Republican Senators who met with President Biden to discuss the details of a more targeted COVID-19 relief proposal capable of garnering bipartisan support. My colleagues and I recognize the President’s calls for unity and want to work in good faith with his administration to meet the health, economic, and societal challenges of the COVID crisis. Our plan mirrors many of the components from his plan, including increasing funding for the production and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine; providing economic relief for Americans with the greatest need; extending enhanced federal unemployment benefits; providing nutrition assistance to help struggling families; providing additional assistance for our small businesses; getting our children safely back to school and ensuring they can stay open; and increasing resources for child care, which is critical to getting Americans back to work.  Yesterday, I sent a letter to President Biden, with Senators Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) outlining our COVID-19 relief compromise.  Since March 2019, Congress has passed five bipartisan Covid-19 relief bills and provided more than $4 trillion in COVID-19 relief. The latest COVID-19 relief package provided $900 billion in additional resources and was signed into law on December 27, 2020. Much of that assistance is only now being disbursed.  Click here for more details on the proposal.  
February is Black History Month
February is Black History Month. This month, and throughout the year, we reflect on centuries of Black history and heritage in communities across Indiana and the country. Over the past three years in the Senate, and throughout my tenure as an elected official, I have made it a priority to meet with Indiana’s Black leaders and hear firsthand what changes needs to occur. As such, I have been working closely with these groups to enact real reforms within criminal justice, affordable housing, health care, job opportunities, and education.   While Black History Month is often synonymous with prominent figures such as Martin Luther King Jr., Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, and more, this February, I ask that all Hoosiers recognize and celebrate the contributions of all our Black communities and how their efforts have helped make Indiana the great state it is today.
Supporting the Pro-Life Agenda and March for Life 
Year after year, Hoosiers remain united behind our most fundamental right - the right to life. Even though this year’s March for Life was virtual, it was just as important that we stand up for the unborn, especially now that the Biden Administration has already taken steps to allow taxpayer-funded abortions on demand. I will continue to support legislation that protects innocent life.  President Biden’s reversal of abortion restrictions goes against the pro-life principles supported by a majority of Americans and certainly by most Hoosiers. I am sickened that making abortions easier to obtain was one of the President’s top priorities upon taking office.  As a Senator, President Biden supported the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for abortions. However, now that he has risen to the White House, it’s clear he is taking orders from the radical left who support taxpayer-funded abortions on demand. I will continue fighting back against these horrific actions and doing everything in my power to protect the unborn.
Click here to learn more about my efforts to defend life through:  
The No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act 
	•	The bill would prohibit the use of federal funds for abortions or for health care coverage that includes abortions.
The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act 
	•	The bill would protect unborn babies after 20 weeks post-fertilization, a point at which research has shown unborn children feel pain. The United States is currently one of only seven countries in the world that allow abortions after 20 weeks – a list which includes human rights violators like China and North Korea.
The Support and Value Expectant (SAVE) Moms and Babies Act 
	•	The bill would strengthen the oversight of chemical abortion drugs, prevent providers from dispensing them remotely, and stop the approval of new types of these drugs.
The Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act 
	•	The bill would ensure that babies who survive an attempted abortion have a chance at life by requiring health care practitioners to provide the same level of treatment for these babies as they would for any other baby born at the same age. 
The Dignity for Aborted Children Act 
	•	The bill would ensure the bodies of the unborn are treated with respect by enforcing guidelines for the dignified handling of aborted fetal remains. 
The Protecting Life in Foreign Assistance Act 
	•	The bill would codify the expanded Mexico City Policy in law, ensuring no U.S. foreign aid be provided to organizations that provide or promote abortions.  
The Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act 
	•	The bill would prohibit elective abortion providers, such as Planned Parenthood, from receiving federal grants through the Title X Family Planning Program.
The Defund Planned Parenthood Act 
	•	The bill would prohibit federal funding for Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider.
New START Extension to Limit Russia’s Strategic Arsenal  
Over the last 10 years, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty has advanced our national security and effectively constrained Russia’s strategic nuclear arsenal. Extending New START is clearly in our nation’s best interest, and that’s why I am pleased to hear the Biden Administration is working to renew the Treaty with Russia for five years. I hope both sides are able to swiftly come to an agreement to preserve this important arms control accord.  New START keeps a lid on Russia’s long-range nuclear capabilities that target the U.S. homeland and includes an extensive monitoring regime that provides us valuable insight into the operations, composition, and location of Russia’s nuclear forces. Critically, extending New START will also lay the groundwork for negotiating follow-on agreements with Russia and pursuing parallel efforts to engage China on arms control.  Looking beyond New START, I look forward to working with the new Administration to continue enhancing other aspects of our nuclear deterrence, including the bipartisan work to modernize the United States’ nuclear arsenal, and craft an effective, durable arms control strategy that enhances our national security. 
Constitutional Amendment To Keep SCOTUS At Nine Justices 
Last week, I joined my colleagues in reintroducing a constitutional amendment that would limit the Supreme Court of the United States to nine justices. The Supreme Court has had nine seats since 1869.  The Supreme Court is critical to our system of checks and balances, and proposals that call for expanding the Court to further partisan goals are antithetical to American values. Such efforts would irreparably harm our democracy and Americans’ faith in our institutions. I hope the new administration will support this effort to reaffirm our commitment to the norms that have served us well for the past 150 years.
National School Choice Week Resolution
I introduced a resolution declaring last week as National School Choice Week. In a time when COVID-19 has severely limited access to quality education for many, parents across the country continue to recognize the importance of school choice. According to a new survey released by the American Federation for Children, 72 percent of K-12 parents who work full-time support school choice.  The education of our youth is a priority for all Hoosiers. Families should be allowed to choose the type of education that best suits their children’s needs. I’m proud to support National School Choice Week as we recognize and celebrate all kinds of learning opportunities for Hoosiers, especially during this pandemic.
Gateway to Careers Act to Expand Job Opportunities and Strengthen Innovative Businesses
Every Hoosier deserves a fair shot at success. My Gateway to Careers Act would help remove barriers that keep individuals from excelling in our ever-changing workforce. This bill would provide resources to individuals in need to help train our workers, support our businesses, and grow our economy – which is especially relevant during this pandemic.  Learn more about this bill here.  
The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act
Each day, the world becomes more aware of the horrific human rights abuses being committed by the Chinese Communist Party against the Uyghur people in Xinjiang, China. Governments and industries alike need to speak up for those being oppressed and enslaved in these modern-day concentration camps. It is unconscionable that western companies would benefit from modern day slavery. These human rights atrocities must stop and I am glad to work with my bipartisan colleagues to help bring an end to these abuses.  Which is why, last week, I helped reintroduce the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. This bipartisan bill will ensure that goods made with Uyghur forced labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) do not enter the United States. Earlier this year, the State Department issued a determination that the Chinese Communist Party is committing crimes against humanity and genocide against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.

BROADBAND 
Take a Speed Test Here. 
The sad fact is that many places in West Virginia simply do not have access to reliable broadband and the lack of access affects West Virginians every day. Back in 2015, the FCC released a coverage map that stated 99.9% of Americans had wireless coverage. I knew then what I know now: That is just plain wrong.

From the Hill to the Mountains
JANUARY 15, 2021: MANCHIN URGES UTILIZATION OF INCREASED FUNDING AND SUPPORT FOR HOMELESS STUDENTS IN WEST VIRGINIA  Charleston, WV – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) urged the Department of Education to swiftly implement additional support he secured in the year-end package to better assist students experiencing homelessness in West Virginia. Schools across the state have reported a significant increase in student homelessness due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Senator said in part, ""It is now more urgent than ever before to address the needs of students experiencing homelessness. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department’s data showed that 1.5 million homeless children and youth were identified and enrolled in public schools – an 11 percent increase over the previous school year and the highest number on record.  The economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly exacerbated this situation, causing more families and youth to struggle without a safe, stable home environment, and creating even more barriers to their education."" 
JANUARY 13, 2021: DOZENS OF RURAL WEST VIRGINIA HEALTH PROVIDERS ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING AFTER MANCHIN EFFORTS  Charleston, WV – U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) announced that six West Virginia counties are now eligible for funding through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) which determines a large percentage of grants and awards for rural health providers. After Senator Manchin’s efforts, HRSA made revisions to the Rural-Urban Commuting Areas (RUCA) codes, which changed Boone, Clay, Hampshire, Lincoln, Preston and Wirt counties from “urban” to “rural”. In October 2020, Senator Manchin submitted comments supporting the HRSA policy change.  ""After pushing for over a year to change the classification system that kept rural West Virginia counties from crucial healthcare funding, HRSA announced revisions to the RUCA codes are complete, making dozens of health providers eligible for rural grants and assistance across West Virginia,"" said Senator Manchin. ""I am pleased our hard work paid off and health providers now have access to funding that supports critical programs including black lung/coal miner clinics programs, rural opioid response programs, rural HIV/AIDS planning programs, rural telehealth programs, State Offices of Rural Health, hospital flex grants, and many more. While we did not change all of the county classifications we advocated for, I will continue to work with HRSA to change the classifications and get our health providers the funding they need to serve West Virginians."" 
JANUARY 13, 2021: MANCHIN CHAMPIONED RENTAL ASSISTANCE FOR WEST VIRGINIANS  Senator Manchin Led Calls For Rental Assistance In Initial COVID Relief Assistance Proposal Charleston, WV – In December, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) championed rental assistance programs for West Virginians when he led COVID-19 emergency relief negotiations. Senator Manchin’s initial emergency relief proposal – which was the framework of the final package – included $25 billion in rental assistance. As a result of Senator Manchin’s leadership, West Virginia is slated to receive an estimated $200 million from the federal Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program that was established in the recent COVID-19 stimulus package. These funds will be administered through the West Virginia Housing Development Fund to assist Mountaineers with paying rent, utilities, and other housing-related needs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  ""Across the state, West Virginians are struggling to find jobs, put food on the table, or keep a roof over their head due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I fought to include rental assistance in the recent COVID-19 stimulus package and now West Virginia will receive an estimated $200 million from the Emergency Rental Assistance program to provide rental assistance and help keep a roof over our neighbors’ heads. I will continue to work with federal, state, and local parties to ensure this program is up and running as quickly as possible so West Virginians can get the help they need during these difficult times,"" said Senator Manchin. 
  
  
HONORING CHUCK YEAGER’S LEGACY
MANCHIN HONORS GENERAL CHUCK YEAGER  Charleston, WV – U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), released a video tribute honoring the life and legacy of General Chuck Yeager, an American hero and native West Virginian.  ""The legacy Chuck leaves is such an important part of our heritage as West Virginians.  Our little state has mined the coal that forged the steel that built the tanks and ships that keep our country the strongest in the world. It is an honor to remember Chuck as part of our military service heritage and our way of life that sinks deep into the roots of West Virginia’s rich culture. I encourage all Americans to learn what they can about this legendary West Virginian,” Senator Manchin said in part.

MANCHIN, CAPITO ANNOUNCE $339 MILLION FOR COVID-19 RELIEF TO WEST VIRGINIA SCHOOLS  Charleston, WV - U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $339,000,000 from the U.S. Department of Education as part of the most recent COVID-19 relief package to help West Virginia schools respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. This funding can be used for testing, to address learning loss, and to assist schools in ways like improving air quality in buildings as schools prepare for eventual reopening. This funding was made available through the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER), and builds on a previously announced award from the CARES Act at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  ""The COVID-19 pandemic hit our students, teachers, and faculty hard, forcing them to quickly adjust to new ways of learning and teaching. During the negotiations for the emergency COVID-19 relief package passed at the end of last year, I advocated for this funding to support our schools and students as they navigate these difficult times. I’m glad West Virginia has received this funding to help with testing and other priorities and will continue to fight for West Virginia priorities in any future relief legislation,"" said Senator Manchin.   
MANCHIN, CAPITO ANNOUNCE FUNDING TO EXPAND COVID-19 TESTING, VACCINE DISTRIBUTION IN WEST VIRGINIA  Charleston, WV – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $119,346,660 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) through the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act. Of the $119,346,660 appropriated for West Virginia, $103,153,083 is allocated for expanded COVID-19 testing and contact tracing, while $16,193,577 will be used for assistance in distributing the COVID-19 vaccine.   ""As cases continue to rise in West Virginia and across the nation, we must expand COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, and vaccinations so we can defeat this terrible pandemic,"" Senator Manchin said. ""This funding will help West Virginia ensure vaccines are administered to every West Virginian who wants one as they become available and will support the testing and contact tracing programs across the state that help slow the spread of the virus. We must keep working together to beat the COVID-19 virus, and I will continue to fight for West Virginia to receive funding that helps our neighbors, family and friends stay as safe as possible during these difficult times.”

COVID relief vital to successful reopening of schools

By Rep. Adriano Espaillat
Original Article Published in The Hill
May 25, 2021


It’s been over a year since students and families around the country had their lives and education upended by the COVID-19 pandemic. Millions of students had to adapt to a whole new world of learning — a world that isn’t shy of difficulty and disparity. But, in spite of this, teachers, administrators, and school employees alike have worked tirelessly to support our children during this time of great uncertainty — and as states begin to reopen, it’s now our job to ensure that they have the resources they need to ensure their schools’ safely and wellbeing.

This is why the American Rescue Plan is so critical. It puts safety first, and helps students, universities, and communities around the nation get back on track, and build back better.



At the forefront of this public health crisis, the greatest concerns have been for the health and safety of our students and their families. And now, a year later, there is a safe path forward — and we can do it, both in communities throughout my congressional district, and in communities around the nation.

As schools begin to re-open and our students head back to their classrooms, Congress, the Biden-Harris administration, and Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona have been hard at work to provide the resources and support our schools need to make in-person learning a reality again — being driven by science and supported by educators, students, and their families along the way.

As the only formerly undocumented member of Congress, I’m especially appreciative of Secretary Cardona and the U.S. Department of Education for ensuring this vitally necessary funding reaches every student who has been severely impacted by this pandemic, including DACA recipients, undocumented students, and international students. Members of Congress, including myself and our bicameral leaders in higher education, have been absolutely clear that the decision by the prior administration to exclude these students from emergency aid — many of whom suspended their education in order to work in frontline jobs during this pandemic — was a sure-fire contradiction to original congressional intent and a plain reading of the law.

And for a solution to get our education system back on track, you don’t need to look any farther than the American Rescue Plan. It delivers $125 billion for K-12 education and nearly $40 billion for childcare providers, including Head Start, to get our children safely back in schools. These funds were made available to state education departments so that they can get schools open safely, keep schools open safely, and reinvigorate our students – because the toll virtual learning took on our children will take years to remedy.

It comes as no surprise that virtual learning has put an incredible burden on our community – with countless families around the country needing more resources to manage their children’s education from home, having to adapt to working from home, battling to secure unemployment assistance, and so much more. Simply put, the transition to online learning was no small feat to be tackled by our teachers and school administrators, and they should be applauded for how much they were able to accomplish. However, we now see the additional stressors this transition put on our educators and staff who are – still – working overtime to re-create engaging and creative learning spaces online for our students.

But this transition to virtual and remote learning also put a burden on our students – a heavy one. With over a year in-person engagement lost, our children have been barred from developing crucial social skills that just simply can’t be learned through their screens. Too many students have had to resort to using free, and limited, Wi-Fi from restaurants, public libraries, and other businesses while using school-issued laptops, tablets, and other devices just to get by and complete their assignments on time. And because of this, we’re seeing disparities like these more clearly now than ever before, seeing just as clearly the structural weaknesses that COVID-19 exposed — and exploited.

While we do not yet know the long-term effects that this crisis will have on the next generation, we know that — at least in the near-term — in-person learning is absolutely critical. And that’s why we need to reopen our schools safely.

With the American Rescue plan providing billions for COVID-19 tracing, testing, and vaccines, states can — and must — finally get our children safely back in school. And it’s about time.

We can’t become passive or take for granted the process we have made as a nation. We need to continue following the CDC protocols, getting our families vaccinated, and wearing face masks as needed for those yet to be fully vaccinated. And with this nearly $130 billion investment from the American Rescue Plan, we can modify our educational spaces so students and teachers can socially distance, have improved ventilation in closed areas, and be provided additional support to get our children’s educations back on track.

The American Rescue Plan also provides $36 billion for nearly 5,000 public and private, nonprofit colleges and universities nationwide and will help local institutions cope with the severe financial distress caused by the pandemic and as they continue serving their students safely. At least half of the funding each institution receives will be distributed in the form of emergency cash assistance grants to students who are facing hunger, homelessness, and other hardship. On top of that, nearly $3 billion in additional funding will be made available for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), other Minority-Serving Institutions, and other under-resourced institutions.

I know that what we have asked of our schools, our educators, our students, and their families has been extraordinary. But now, with vaccines becoming available to more and more adults and children, and with the measures we’ve learned and deployed to stop the spread of COVID-19 and combat this pandemic, we now have the resources needed to make a larger and more robust return to in-person learning — all while keeping our children safe, and lifting a burden off of their families along the way.

Schools don’t serve just one purpose — and this pandemic has shown us that. Schools are a place for education, recreation, nutrition, health care, mental health care, and emotional support. Our children need to get back to learning about different cultures and experiences. And with the American Rescue Plan, we can do it.

El alivio por COVID es vital para la reapertura exitosa de las escuelas
Por Rep. Adriano Espaillat Artículo original publicado en The Hill 25 de mayo, 2021  

Ha pasado más de un año desde que la pandemia de COVID-19 cambió la vida y la educación de estudiantes y familias de todo el país. Millones de estudiantes tuvieron que adaptarse a un mundo de aprendizaje completamente nuevo, un mundo que no se amilana ante la dificultad y la disparidad. Pero, a pesar de esto, maestros, administradores y empleados de escuela por igual han trabajado incansablemente para apoyar a nuestros niños durante este tiempo de gran incertidumbre, y a medida que los estados comienzan a reabrir, ahora es nuestro trabajo asegurarnos de que tengan los recursos que necesitan para garantizar la seguridad y el bienestar de sus escuelas.

Es por eso por lo que el Plan de Rescate Estadounidense es tan crucial. El plan pone la seguridad en primer lugar y ayuda a los estudiantes, las universidades y las comunidades de todo el país a volver a la normalidad y a reconstruir mejor.



Al frente de esta crisis de salud pública, las mayores preocupaciones han sido por la salud y seguridad de nuestros estudiantes y sus familias. Y ahora, un año después, hay un camino seguro hacia adelante, y podemos hacerlo, tanto en las comunidades de mi distrito congresual como en las comunidades de toda la nación.

A medida que las escuelas comienzan a reabrir y nuestros estudiantes regresan a sus aulas, el Congreso, la administración Biden-Harris y el secretario de Educación, Miguel Cardona, han trabajado arduamente para proporcionar los recursos y el apoyo que nuestras escuelas necesitan para lograr que el aprendizaje presencial sea una realidad de nuevo ―impulsado por la ciencia y apoyado por educadores, estudiantes y sus familias a lo largo del camino.

Como el único miembro del Congreso que alguna vez fue indocumentado, agradezco especialmente al secretario Cardona y al Departamento de Educación de los EE.UU. por garantizar que esta financiación vitalmente necesaria llegue a todos los estudiantes que se han visto gravemente afectados por esta pandemia, incluidos los beneficiarios de DACA, los estudiantes indocumentados y los estudiantes internacionales. Los miembros del Congreso, incluyéndome a mí y a nuestros líderes bicamerales en educación superior, han sido absolutamente claros que la decisión de la administración anterior de excluir a estos estudiantes de la ayuda de emergencia ―muchos de los cuales suspendieron su educación para trabajar en puestos de primera línea durante esta pandemia― fue una verdadera contradicción a la intención original del Congreso y a una lectura clara de la ley.

Y para encontrar una solución que vuelva a encarrilar nuestro sistema educativo, no es necesario que busque más allá del Plan de Rescate Estadounidense. Este ofrece $125 mil millones para la educación K-12 y casi $40 mil millones para los proveedores de cuidado infantil, incluyendo Head Start, para que nuestros niños regresen a las escuelas de manera segura. Estos fondos se pusieron a disposición de los departamentos de educación estatales para que puedan hacer que las escuelas abran de manera segura, mantener las escuelas abiertas de manera segura y fortalecer a nuestros estudiantes, porque el costo del aprendizaje virtual para nuestros niños tomará años remediar.

No es de extrañar que el aprendizaje virtual haya puesto una carga increíble en nuestra comunidad, con innumerables familias en todo el país que necesitan más recursos para administrar la educación de sus hijos desde el hogar, tener que adaptarse a trabajar desde casa, luchar para conseguir la asistencia por desempleo, y mucho más. En pocas palabras, la transición al aprendizaje en línea no fue una pequeña hazaña que nuestros maestros y administradores escolares debieron abordar, y deben ser aplaudidos por lo mucho que pudieron lograr. Sin embargo, ahora vemos los factores estresantes adicionales que esta transición ejerce sobre nuestros educadores y personal que, todavía, están trabajando horas extra para recrear espacios de aprendizaje atractivos y creativos en línea para nuestros estudiantes.

Pero esta transición al aprendizaje virtual y remoto también supuso una carga para nuestros estudiantes, una pesada carga. Con más de un año perdido de participación en persona, a nuestros niños se les ha impedido desarrollar habilidades sociales cruciales que simplemente no se pueden aprender a través de sus pantallas. Demasiados estudiantes han tenido que recurrir al uso de Wi-Fi gratuito y limitado de restaurantes, bibliotecas públicas y otras empresas mientras usaban computadoras portátiles, tabletas y otros dispositivos proporcionados por la escuela solo para salir adelante y completar sus tareas a tiempo. Y debido a esto, estamos viendo disparidades como estas más claramente ahora que nunca, viendo con la misma claridad las debilidades estructurales que el COVID-19 expuso y explotó.

Si bien aún no conocemos los efectos a largo plazo que esta crisis tendrá en la próxima generación, sabemos que, al menos a corto plazo, el aprendizaje en persona es absolutamente fundamental. Y es por eso por lo que necesitamos reabrir nuestras escuelas de manera segura.

Con el Plan de Rescate Estadounidense que proporciona miles de millones para el rastreo, las pruebas y las vacunas de COVID-19, los estados pueden, y deben, finalmente hacer que nuestros niños regresen a la escuela de manera segura. Y ya era hora.

No podemos volvernos pasivos o dar por sentado el proceso que hemos realizado como nación. Necesitamos continuar siguiendo los protocolos de los CDC, vacunando a nuestras familias y usando mascarillas según sea necesario para aquellos que aún no están completamente vacunados. Y con esta inversión de casi $130 mil millones del Plan de Rescate Estadounidense, podemos modificar nuestros espacios educativos para que los estudiantes y maestros puedan distanciarse socialmente, tener una mejor ventilación en áreas cerradas y recibir apoyo adicional para que la educación de nuestros niños vuelva a encarrilarse.

El Plan de Rescate Estadounidense también proporciona $36 mil millones para casi 5,000 universidades de dos y cuatro años públicas y privadas sin fines de lucro en todo el país y ayudará a las instituciones locales a hacer frente a las graves dificultades financieras causadas por la pandemia, mientras continúan brindando servicios a sus estudiantes de manera segura. Al menos la mitad de los fondos que recibe cada institución se distribuirá en forma de subvenciones de asistencia en efectivo de emergencia a los estudiantes que enfrentan hambre, falta de vivienda y otras dificultades. Además de eso, se pondrán a disposición casi $3 mil millones en fondos adicionales para Colleges y Universidades Históricamente Negros (HBCU), Colleges y Universidades Tribales (TCU), otras Instituciones al Servicio de Minorías y otras instituciones de escasos recursos.

Sé que lo que les hemos pedido a nuestras escuelas, a nuestros educadores, a nuestros estudiantes y sus familias ha sido extraordinario. Pero ahora, con las vacunas disponibles para más y más adultos y niños, y con las medidas que hemos aprendido e implementado para detener la propagación del COVID-19 y combatir esta pandemia, ahora tenemos los recursos necesarios para hacer un mayor y más sólido retorno al aprendizaje presencial, todo mientras se mantiene a nuestros niños seguros y se les quita la carga a sus familias en el camino.

Las escuelas no tienen un solo propósito, y esta pandemia nos lo ha demostrado. Las escuelas son un lugar para la educación, la recreación, la nutrición, el cuidado de la salud, el cuidado de la salud mental y el apoyo emocional. Nuestros niños necesitan volver a aprender sobre diferentes culturas y experiencias. Y con el Plan de Rescate Estadounidense podemos hacerlo.

Dear Friends: 
During President Biden’s the first 100 days in office, Democrats have passed the American Rescue Plan to get shots in arms, money in pockets, children in schools and people in jobs. The U.S. has administered over 230 million vaccines and more than 95 million Americans are fully vaccinated. More than 18 million Americans are able to pay their bills because they continue to receive unemployment benefits that were extended in the American Rescue Plan. 
 
These are important accomplishments, but more needs to be done. Unfortunately, as long as the filibuster remains in place, a small minority of Senators retain the ability to block everything the House has passed, from voting rights and policing reform to stronger background checks for guns. We cannot make the progress we need to make without changing this outdated rule in the Senate. To learn more about the filibuster and upcoming legislation to recover from the COVIC-19 pandemic, I invite you to join me for a telephone town hall on Thursday, April 29th at 6 p.m. I will be joined by the author of Kill Switch: The Rise of the Modern Senate and the Crippling of American Democracy, Adam Jentleson. Jentleson is the Executive Director of Battle Born Collective and a former deputy chief of staff to Senator Harry Reid. Also joining me will be a representative from San Mateo County Health to answer your COVID-19 related questions.

January 22, 2021 


Earlier this week, we took time to reflect on the vision, the mission, and the dream of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. His birthday calls on us to reevaluate our progress in fulfilling what he called the “promissory note” of equal rights, equal justice, and equal opportunity in our nation. Dr. King often preached that “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice” – he also knew that it doesn’t bend on its own. Each of us has a responsibility to participate in our democracy, confront social and racial injustice in all its forms, and bend that arc further and faster. As we turn the page on this dark chapter in American history, our country must move forward armed with the spirit and wisdom of Dr. King’s message. 
Celebrating a New Day
Wednesday marked the beginning of a new chapter for our country. We witnessed the historic swearing-in of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as our next President and Vice President of the United States. I was moved to watch Vice President Harris take her oath of office on the bible owned by a son of Baltimore and barrier-breaking Supreme Court Justice, Thurgood Marshall. And I was inspired by President Biden’s call for unity over division, as he addressed our nation for the first time as Commander-In-Chief. 
President Biden and Vice President Harris have pledged to serve each and every American – both those who voted for them and those who didn’t. While our nation now faces some of the most difficult challenges in our history, I am committed to working with the new Administration and my colleagues in Congress to meet these problems head-on. Together, we must work to heal our country, stride boldly into the future, and pursue a more perfect, just, and equal union. 
Tackling the Challenges at Hand
Our top priority must be to beat this pandemic and bring relief to those hardest hit by the economic fallout of this crisis. Marylanders are still struggling to make ends meet and are seeking action amid the growing challenges in vaccine rollout and the climbing death toll, which has now surpassed 400,000 in the United States. I’m glad that lawmakers came together in December to pass another bipartisan stimulus bill and was pleased to join the Maryland delegation last week to announce that $400 million will go to expanding our state’s vaccine distribution, contact tracing, and testing capacity. But much work remains to be done, and we must pass more emergency relief now. 
Fighting the COVID-19 pandemic requires an all-hands-on-deck approach. I’m glad to see the Biden Administration hit the ground running with their national strategy to fully mobilize the federal government and improve coordination with state and local governments to overcome this pandemic. And I support President Biden’s comprehensive plan, which will help us tackle the coronavirus head-on by boosting our capacity to vaccinate, test for, and treat this disease. From the start, I have urged the Executive Branch to make full use of the Defense Production Act to generate the necessary supplies to fight the pandemic, and I am glad President Biden is moving quickly to do so. Biden’s strategy also includes support for our state and local governments – a priority I’ve repeatedly pressed for – by providing new funds and increasing the federal cost share for FEMA and National Guard assistance to 100 percent. Critically, this plan confronts the child care crisis, prioritizes the safe reopening of schools, and will provide our students and educators with more resources to improve learning at this challenging time. President Biden’s plan also commits to addressing the disparate impact of this pandemic on communities of color and will help tackle these challenges by improving community-based services. Last but not least, this new strategy lays the groundwork to reopen our economy and build back better. I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to implement and build on this plan. I also support President Biden’s earlier-released American Rescue Plan, which will increase the $600 payments by an additional $1,400, bringing the total relief payment to $2,000 per eligible person, among other key provisions. It’s time to move full-steam ahead. 
The coronavirus has also shone a harsh light on the deeper, structural challenges facing our nation that we must confront at their source. We need to build back better – with an emphasis on “better.” I will fight to build a dynamic economy that works for everyone, root out systemic racism in all its forms, and address the threat of the climate crisis by investing in clean energy and making polluters pay – and I look forward to partnering with the Biden-Harris Administration to meet these pressing challenges with urgency. I’m pleased that the new Administration has already moved forward with executive actions to tackle the pandemic, promote equity, and protect our planet. Congress has a responsibility to pass legislation alongside these vital efforts, and I will work every day in the halls of the Senate to achieve that goal. 
Defying Insurrection
In order to march toward the future, we need to resolve the unfinished business of the past. Make no mistake: while serving as Commander-in-Chief, Donald Trump threatened the safety and security of our democracy, demonstrated contempt for our Constitution, and violated his oath to protect the American people and defend our republic. The Article of Impeachment passed in a bipartisan vote by the House of Representatives last week makes the case plain: Trump “engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanors by inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” His conduct left the Congress with no choice but to take action, and I stand with the House in its decision to impeach. Now, his case goes to the United States Senate, and I believe lawmakers of both parties have a moral duty to hold Trump accountable. I believe accountability and unity go hand-in-hand. As President Biden said in his inaugural address, “We must reject a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured… Each of us has a duty and responsibility, as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders, leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation, to defend the truth and defeat the lies."" Joining forces and working across the aisle to achieve that goal will help our nation come together again. I am convinced that our brightest days are still to come.

HAPPY  MOTHER'S  DAY 
On Mother’s Day, we honor and celebrate our mothers, tell them how much we love them, or for some of us, cherish their beautiful memories.   Being a mom is a big responsibility, at times a lot of work, and ultimately a wonderful gift!  Some of our families were far away from each other over this past year, and it’s a blessing to see more and more families reunited due to repatriation flights.   To all of you, the mothers in American Samoa, thank you for what you do, and know we love you. God bless, and we wish each of you a healthy and happy Mother’s Day!  

  Soifua, 

Member of Congress 
  
 
On President Biden’s Speech To Congress
Last week, I attended President Biden’s first speech to Congress at the U.S. Capitol, marking 100 days of the administration this week, though attendance was limited due to Covid precautions. 
I was humbled to be selected to attend in person, as out of 441 total Members of the House only 200 could go. President Biden announced his legislative push for the infrastructure package and new benefits for families with children. I support a strong infrastructure focus, and my priority is the needs of LBJ Tropical Medical Center, plus attention to necessary roads, seawall, and other local efforts and projects.  The President is proposing two years of paid community college, which would be important to our young people and American Samoa Community College. He’s proposing free pre-school for ages 3 and 4, along with other child care and nutrition measures. Just this week, I signed a joint letter from Members of Congress working together for a major investment in K-12 education.  

 I took part in a Natural Resources Committee markup before the President’s speech 
  
This legislation, called for by President Biden, will be written with input from the House and Senate. Working with the other Territories, my priority is always that American Samoa is fully included and treated fairly along with the States. Later this week, I am meeting with the White House liaison to Congress, to discuss how our goals for American Samoa can line up with the President’s policy initiatives.  During this pandemic, we are seeing record federal spending, but the U.S. economy has proven to be strong and resilient. The vaccine success is another factor helping people get back to work and the economy moving. I appreciate the thoughtful responding speech by Senator Tim Scott, who is a respected leader in the U.S. Senate. Congress should be mindful of how U.S. businesses can be kept on a competitive footing with international corporations as new taxes are discussed. I will keep you informed on important legislative developments, and what it will mean to American Samoa. 
  
 
Emphasizing Health Infrastructure
I again emphasized health infrastructure in a Wednesday hearing of the Natural Resources Committee’s Subcommittee for Indigenous Peoples, stating for the record that LBJ Tropical Medical Center is “in dire need of replacement or repair.” The oversight hearing was titled “Infrastructure in Indigenous Communities: Priorities for American Jobs Plan.”   I continue to include LBJ Tropical Medical Center at every opportunity in Washington, as Congress and President Biden are currently emphasizing infrastructure considerations. I empathize with the testimony showing challenges for remote communities in Alaska and tribal communities, and that description has similarities to our needs in American Samoa, as we work for long term solutions for better health infrastructure.”  

Congresswoman Amata on Capitol Hill this week. 
 
The Committee examined the proposed infrastructure legislation in terms of providing health care infrastructure support in these areas, and the need for clarity and specifics in providing those services despite geographic challenges.  
  
 
Firefighter Appreciation Day
I highlighted Firefighter Appreciation Day, also known as International Firefighters’ Day:  On Firefighter Appreciation Day, I want to say thank you to our firefighters for their readiness and responses. They help educate us to prevent house fires, and rush to contain them so lives are saved, each time along with potentially a lifetime of possessions and memories in a home.  

We specially remember and think of the families of Captain Mike Tipoti and Captain Allen Velega. Our community lost these senior firefighters last year in a vehicle accident as they were doing their jobs, serving the public, returning from responding to a fire call.  

 I commended American Samoa’s firefighters in 2018 and presented congressional certificates 
 In 2017, I had the opportunity to officially thank our firefighters in Congress. As I said then, in American Samoa, we are blessed with abundant rainfall and green vegetation, so we can be thankful we aren’t likely to ever see a raging forest wildfire like the American West endures. Instead, when those fires were at their worst, our firefighters more than once have generously gone to join their fight and serve others on the U.S. West Coast.   We love and appreciate our firefighters. 
 
Thank You Teachers
I thanked teachers for Teacher Appreciation Week (May 3-7):  This week is a great time to let a teacher know they are truly appreciated. Our teachers care about our children, teens, and young people in college or vocational school. Teachers choose to invest their lives in these young people.  

We all tend to look back on a teacher in our lives that inspired us, helped direct us, or improved us in some way. Teachers make a difference, and are important to our community. They spend many hours with our children, and can be a meaningful influence for years after their classes.  I’m encouraged by federal investment in education last year and ongoing funding efforts this year, as we need to continue providing tools and improvements so our teachers can be at their best for our students. 
Thank you, Teachers, and God bless you! 
 
  
 
National Nurses Week

I am highlighting National Nurses Week, also called Nurse Appreciation Week, celebrated May 6-12, partly to coincide with the birthday of Florence Nightingale, often described as the founder of modern nursing:  A special thank you this week to all the nurses serving in American Samoa. During this pandemic, we’ve looked to nurses to prepare for COVID-19, continue to care for all the health needs of our people, and now take part in a massive vaccination effort. You’ve done a great job, especially in these circumstances for many months.   Anyone who has ever experienced a health crisis, a time of hospitalization, or a loved one under medical care knows what a remarkable difference a caring nurse can make to a patient and their family.  This National Nurses Week, may God bless our nurses in a special way!

Dear Friend,

After surpassing the necessary 270 electoral votes, the Electoral College certified the victory of former Vice President Biden following a close and competitive campaign season. 

President Trump said that he would live by the decision of the Electoral College, and on Monday, the Electoral College certified Vice President Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election.

In the House, I will work with the new administration to defeat COVID-19 and deliver commonsense solutions for central Arkansas’s families, workers, and small businesses.

COVID-19 VACCINE ROLLS OUT

 Last Friday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use.  This was the fastest vaccine ever produced for a novel pathogen and demonstrated a 95% effectiveness rate during clinical trials. According to scientists and professionals at the FDA, the vaccine has proven to be safe and effective.  

 On Sunday, U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar stated that, based on the distribution plan and strategy of Operation Warp Speed, 20 million Americans will receive the vaccine in December, 50 million Americans will receive the vaccine by the end of January, and an estimated 50 million Americans will receive the vaccine by the end of February.   Over the weekend, the Trump Administration worked with Pfizer to begin the vaccine distribution process to the American people. On Monday morning, health care workers and individuals who live and work in long-term care facilities received the first doses of the vaccine.  On Tuesday, I stopped by a pharmacy in Little Rock, where preparations were being made to administer the first doses and distribute Pfizer’s vaccine all across the state.  According to a briefing held by the FDA yesterday, Moderna’s vaccine for COVID-19 will likely soon join Pfizer and BioNTech with vaccine approvals, which are critical to bringing a swift end to the pandemic.  Another incredible, long-lasting impact of Operation Warp Speed is the new technology used by Pfizer and Moderna. These vaccines do not contain live viruses – the traditional method. Instead, they use mRNA – Messenger RNA. This generic material instructs the body to make a fragment of a viral protein to elicit an immune response.  This new approach will lead to new and better vaccines to fight Ebola, HIV, and some cancers.  The tireless and diligent efforts of our scientists and doctors have paved the way for this unprecedented and historic medical accomplishment. This vaccine’s development and distribution network could not have been possible without the effective planning and framework created by Operation Warp Speed and the Trump Administration’s efforts to defeat the coronavirus. 


HOUSE COMES TO A BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT TO END SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLING


Last week, leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, House Education and Workforce Committee, House Ways and Means Committee, and Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee came to a bipartisan and bicameral agreement to end surprise medical billing.

This is a promising and beneficial initiative for our patients and families who are burdened by unexpected medical bills, which occur when a patient receives a bill for the difference between the out-of-network provider's fee and the amount covered by the patient's health insurance.

The agreement includes a 30-day period where the insurance plan and the health care providers could try to negotiate a payment for the out-of-network claims – if no agreement is reached, independent arbiters would negotiate a deal based on guidance written into the bill.

Inflated medical costs, drug prices, and surprise medical bills are issues that I have fought to improve and correct during my time in office. This is why I have previously cosponsored the Protecting People from Surprise Medical Bills Act, the Patient Access to Higher Quality Health Care Act, the Lower Costs - More Cures Act, and the Lowering Prescription Drug Costs and Extending Community Health Centers and Other Health Priorities Act.

This effort to reign in surprise medical bills from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will shield Arkansas patients and families from devastating surprise medical costs and is a crucial step in the endeavor to improve our healthcare system.


REOPENING OF TOAD SUCK PARK

 On Monday, the Little Rock District of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced that Toad Suck Park would be reopening to the public following devastating and historic flooding in the spring of 2019.  My staff and I have been pushing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to clean-up and reopen the park, and with the help of flood-related funding from Congress, the Army Corps of Engineers began repairs in October 2019. The Army Corps of Engineers also awarded a contract which aided in the process of general repairs. The total cost to revitalize Toad Suck Park totaled $1.3 million.  The community has been anxious for the park's return, and the U.S. Army Corps. of Engineers noted that its long-awaited repair had been a burden on the residents nearby.  For more information or to make reservations for Toad Suck Park, you can call (877) 444-6777 or click HERE.  

WINNER OF CENTRAL ARKANSAS’S CONGRESSIONAL ART COMPETITION WORK DISPLAYED IN CAPITOL BUILDING

 Congratulations to Victoria Macuil, a student of LISA West High School, on winning first place in the Second Congressional District’s Congressional Art Competition and representing our state in the halls of the United States Capitol!  Each day, my fellow legislators and I from all across the country walk past your beautiful piece titled, “Daily Routine.” I am honored to have your work represent the state of Arkansas in the halls of Congress.  Victoria’s hard work paid off, and I am grateful that this competition gave her the opportunity to showcase her spectacular talents!  



CELEBRATING HANUKKAH


This week, I was pleased to join my good friend Rabbi Yosef Kramer and families in central Arkansas to witness and honor the 30th annual lighting of the menorah for the celebration of Hanukkah.

Every year, Lubavitch of Arkansas organizes and sponsors this traditional lighting of the menorah in celebrating this holiday tradition. I am grateful for Rabbi Kramer’s invitation to witness this special event with my friends in Arkansas.

To my fellow Arkansans who continue to celebrate the remainder of the Festival of Lights, I wish you all a Happy Hanukkah!



It is my honor to represent you in Congress.
 
Please contact me at (501) 324-5941 or Hill.House.Gov if I may be of service to you.

Hello, 
After an unprecedented month of action, I can confidently say: America is back on track. In April we reached 100 days of the Biden administration, and that milestone brought a tremendous amount of achievements. This month we reached 200 million vaccines, recommitted to global climate leadership, and introduced historic investments in America to support working families, rebuild our economy, and restore the country’s crumbling infrastructure. The Biden administration and our Democratic majority in Congress is showing that government can deliver for the people. Below are some highlights from the past month I’d like to share with you.   President Biden’s Plans for Jobs and Families  Just one month after we passed the historic American Rescue Plan to get shots in arms, money in people’s pockets, kids safely back to school, and millions of people back to work, President Biden unveiled our next big deliverable for the American people: the American Jobs Plan. This transformational roadmap will bring our infrastructure into the 21st Century with a focus on equity, jobs, and resilience. For decades, we have woefully neglected our infrastructure, and we know we not only need to rebuild it, we need to improve it. But this plan goes further than just bold investments in our nation’s transportation and infrastructure. It supports American manufacturing, invests in rural and urban communities, creates well-paying jobs, and addresses the most significant crisis of our lifetime: climate change.   
 
Vice President Kamala Harris, President Joe Biden, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the Joint Address to Congress. 
To close out April, President Biden unveiled the third major plan of his administration – the American Families Plan. This plan is an ambitious, once-in-a-generation investment to rebuild the middle class and invest in America’s future. As we rebuild from the pandemic, we must lay a new foundation for working families and an equitable economy. The president’s American Families Plan invests in America’s future to reward work, not wealth, and ensure a bright future for everyone.  Recommitting to Climate Action  In honor of Earth Day, I joined Senator Ed Markey and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to reintroduce the Green New Deal. The GND sets the right standard for climate action by building equity, social justice, public health, and economic opportunity into our climate solutions. These aren’t pie-in-the-sky concepts. The comprehensive, concrete steps outlined in the Green New Deal are what's urgently needed to tackle the climate crisis.    
 
Rep. Huffman joins fellow congress members outside the U.S. Capitol to reintroduce the Green New Deal. Click here to watch a recording of the event. 
I also had the privilege to meet with Climate Envoy John Kerry and my colleagues on the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis ahead of President Biden’s international Leaders Climate Summit. We’re ready to get to work with world leaders on solving the climate crisis—and with renewed goals and leadership in the administration, we are moving full steam ahead.  
 
SCCC members meet virtually with Climate Envoy John Kerry. 
Serving You  In the beginning of April I met with small businesses in Humboldt that have been affected by the COVID pandemic. We talked about the American Rescue Plan and how federal relief programs have helped these small businesses and what challenges remain during recovery.   
 
As always, my staff is hard at work serving you. Whether it’s assistance working with a federal agency or providing information about legislation and policy – we're here to help.   There is no problem too big or small. Your needs matter, and I’d like to share one of our recent success stories:   
 “I lost my home and contents to the Glass Fire. After months spent speaking to dozens of people from federal agencies looking for assistance and failing, someone suggested I contact Congressman Huffman’s office. No one had figured out that I was placed into the wrong disaster classification. Thanks to Rep. Huffman’s staff this was fixed, and I started getting financial assistance! I was about to give up and likely may have become homeless if it wasn’t for Congressman Huffman’s office. Thank you!” -- David, Sonoma CA  
 This is just one example of how my office can help you. As I continue my important work for the people of California’s Second District, please don’t hesitate to contact my office for assistance if you are in need.  
If you would like to keep up with the work I am doing as your representative, please subscribe to my newsletter, and follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. 
I also invite you to subscribe to my podcast, “Off the Cuff with Rep. Huffman,” so that you can engage with our in-depth conversations about what's happening in California and in Washington, D.C. Tune in here for my latest episode with Congresswoman Grace Meng on the rise of hate against AAPI communities. Misinformation, intersectionality, personal experiences—everything was on the table as we talked about this issue and how we can work together to Stop Asian Hate.  Thank you, and stay well,  
Jared HuffmanMember of Congress

Dear Lindsey, 
 
I write to you today for the first edition of Ronny's Roundup with an update on what has been going on in Washington, and resources available in the aftermath of the unprecedented winter weather conditions we experienced in Texas last week. 
  
Connect with Rep. Jackson
To ensure you are receiving the latest updates from my office I encourage you to subscribe to my e-newsletter and follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Please also forward this to your friends and family in TX-13 and encourage them to subscribe, too.

Winter Storm Resources 
Since Texas was hit by an unprecedented winter storm, resulting in power outages, my office has returned hundreds of calls and emails to constituents regarding available resources.
 
Thankfully it looks like we have made it past the power outages, but I know the work does not stop here. The aftermath has left issues with our water and food supply, and the State Legislature begins the important work of examining what happened and implementing changes to ensure it never happens again. 
 
Texans are resilient, so I know we will get through this together. Below you will find important resources and information, but please let my office know if you have questions or would like additional information.
 
Federal Major Disaster Declaration
 
Four counties in TX-13 are currently approved for federal assistance under the White House's Major Disaster Declaration: Cooke, Montague, Wichita, & Wise.
 
This will fall short of what's needed, so I have joined 25 of my Texas colleagues in sending a letter to President Biden calling for ALL 254 counties in Texas to be eligible for assistance.
 
This is how YOU can help. Please report damages you incurred from the recent winter storm and its aftermath using the survey linked below. 
 
The state will use the data in part to present to FEMA and the White House, which will increase the chance of additional counties being approved.
 
  
COMPLETE DAMAGE SURVEY
 
Farmers and Ranchers
 
Texas' farmers and ranchers are eligible for USDA disaster assistance loans for physical losses from the recent winter conditions. 
 
More information regarding the USDA's Disaster Assistance Programs can be found here.
 
These loans will be managed and distributed by your local Farm Service Agency office. Click here to determine which office is closest to you.
 
Individuals
 
Individuals who have had underinsured or uninsured losses in Cooke, Montague, Wichita, or Wise counties can now apply for disaster assistance from FEMA. During the application process please be sure to select the cause of damage as snow/ice, among other damages that may have occurred.
 
If you have damage from the Texas severe winter storms and have insurance, contact your insurance company to file a claim. When you apply for FEMA disaster assistance, you need to provide your insurance claim information.
 
Visit DisasterAssistance.gov or call 1-800-621-3362 to apply. 
 
NOTE: Small businesses should apply through the SBA before applying for individual assistance.
 
The Texas Department of Insurance can provide contact information for insurance companies and answer questions about how to file a claim. Call 800-252-3439 from 8AM to 5PM CT, Monday to Friday. You can also view insurance company contact information online.
 
Additional food assistance is also available in Texas through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Recipients may apply for replacement benefits for food lost or destroyed by dialing 2-1-1.
  
What happened?
The Electric Reliability Council of Texas' (ERCOT) annual winter assessment before this winter season assured the public of Texas that there would be enough power to meet peak demand this winter. Clearly, ERCOT fell short on its promises.
 
That's why I DEMANDED answers from ERCOT on Texas’ power grid failures and lack of preparedness so we can ensure this never happens again.
 
ICYMI: I joined Newsmax over the weekend to offer my perspective. Key takeaways: 
	•	The federal government should not regulate our power grid. The federal government breaks anything it touches. We are capable of solving this in Texas!
	•	What we experienced in Texas last week is exactly why the Green New Deal is a non-starter. The purpose behind the Green New Deal is to fully shift away from fossil fuels to strictly renewable sources. If we were fully reliant on renewable energy in this situation it would have been far worse. 
	•	We can’t be dependent on one form of energy or another country’s energy production—bottom line.
  

  
First Legislation, Standing up to China
I recently introduced my first piece of legislation as a Member of Congress, titled Opposing Business with Chinese Military Companies Act. 
 
President Trump stood up to the Chinese Communist Party in a way no President had before him when he produced a list of Chinese Communist military companies
operating in America and imposed critical sanctions on them.
 
This authority was granted by Congress in the Fiscal Year 1999 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), though no President had the courage to use it until President Trump came on the scene.
 
Now President Biden wants to abandon the important sanctions imposed by President Trump, making clear that Congress needs to change the law from an authorization to a requirement. That is exactly what my bill does! 
 
I am proud to take a stand against China's aggression with my first piece of legislation, and I fully intend on inserting it into this year’s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).
 
Why it matters
 
It should be common sense to prohibit investment in Chinese Communist military companies, which threaten America’s national security, jeopardize American intellectual property, and aid China in carrying out genocide against its own people.
 
The National Defense Strategy rightly emphasizes the growing threat of China, so removing the sanctions and allowing American dollars to go to the Chinese Communist Party would be counterproductive to the goals of the Department of Defense. 
  
Legislative Roundup
Tough on Immigration
	•	Joined the Border Security Caucus.
	•	Sent a letter to President Biden voicing concerns on his recent immigration policies and the spread of COVID-19.
	•	Sent a letter to the Secretary of State and Secretary of Homeland Security opposing any efforts to weaken the screening and vetting of foreign nationals coming to the United States.
Taking Care of Veterans
	•	Cosponsored the Improving Confidence in Veterans’ Care Act which ensures only qualified medical professionals are working at the VA.
Keeping GTMO Open and Vaccinating Americans, not Terrorists
	•	Sent a letter to Secretary Austin expressing concerns about transferring prisoners from, and closing, the Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp (GTMO).
	•	Original cosponsor of a resolution opposing the vaccination for COVID-19 of detainees at Guantanamo Bay detention facility before the vaccination of American citizens.
	•	Original cosponsor of the Vaccinate Americans, Not Terrorists Act which would prohibit the US government from providing a COVID vaccine to GTMO detainees.
Protecting the Unborn
	•	Joined the Pro-Life Caucus.
	•	To date, I have sent 6 letters and co-sponsored 23 pieces of legislation that protect the unborn, limit access to abortions, and/or restrict taxpayer money from funding abortions.
	•	A few examples…
	◦	Defund Planned Parenthood Act – prevents any federal money from going to Planned Parenthood, which received over $550 million in taxpayer’s money while sitting on almost $2 billion in net assets. Instead, this bill directs $235 million to thousands of community health centers that do not perform abortions. 
	◦	Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act – prohibits abortion for unborn children who are 20 weeks or older, which is the age when the child can first feel pain.
	◦	Sent a letter to the SBA Administrator demanding that no money from future rounds of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) go to Planned Parenthood or any organization that performs abortions. 
Ensuring Secure Elections
	•	Cosponsored the Save Democracy Act, which would help protect future elections from fraud. This bill includes commonsense reforms to voter registration, ballot casting, and ballot tabulation processes in federal elections.
	•	Last month, I sent a letter along with some of my Texas colleagues in the House to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton encouraging him to investigate election fraud offenses, and offering Congressional assistance and resources to enforce election laws. We must rebuild trust in our electoral system! 
Reopening Schools
	•	Sent three separate letters encouraging President Biden and his Administration to follow the science and stop listening to special interest groups on school reopenings.
	•	Science shows that schools can safely reopen. Studies also show the harm of virtual learning on the developmental, emotional, and mental health needs of school-aged children.

	•	Stimulus checks for illegal immigrants.
I will not stand for it! There is no reason we cannot make this round of relief meaningful and targeted. Instead, it looks like liberals are choosing wasteful pork and politics.

Calling on Joe Biden to Address His Border Crisis
I joined my Texas colleagues earlier this week to describe what we saw while traveling along the southern border last month. The alarming situations that we all witnessed have only gotten worse due to the inaction by this administration.

Watch my remarks by clicking the link below!

To watch video, please click here.
Fighting for Answers
I’ve seen firsthand health and safety protocols being utterly abandoned at our overflowing migrant holding facilities along the southern border.

This administration can pretend a crisis doesn’t exist, but I'm forcing them to give YOU answers on their plan to solve it.

See my and Congressman Jodey Arrington’s (TX-19) letter below.

To view letter, please click here.
 Expanding the Supreme Court Will Destroy It
 I agree Joe Biden! This is a bonehead idea. Expanding the Supreme Court will destroy it.

But per the usual, if the Democrats can’t win, they cheat. Don’t sleep on this issue, America!

 When Will This Administration Do Something?
 Our migrant holding facilities are totally overwhelmed, our treasury is being squandered, and American and migrant lives are at stake.

How many more children need to be tossed over a 14-foot border wall before this administration does something?

Cartels Are Now Recruiting America's Youth
Cartels are now recruiting America’s youth to do their illegal bidding.

This may be the land of the free – but once you owe the cartels, you’ll never be free again.

Biden must secure the border NOW!

This Is About Power
Our founders knew the nation’s capital should be on neutral ground.

Instead of debating rational solutions like Congressman Jody Hice’s (GA-10), Democrats chose the unconstitutional route because they know it ends with more liberal seats in the U.S. Senate.

This is about power for them.

To read article, please click here.
Words Are Not the Crisis
 Pathetic. This administration won’t stop until we’re borderless, bankrupt, and living in chaos.

Trust me – words aren’t the crisis. The REAL crisis is that the Democrats are helping cartels to enslave, abuse, assault, and kill these migrants, including children.

Trump understood the need to keep Iran under control and non-nuclear – Biden must also.

I was proud to stand with former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and many of my colleagues on Wednesday in support of the Maximum Pressure Act, which will work to sanction and disempower this volatile regime and keep us safe.

Speaker Pelosi Must Hold Her Caucus Accountable
 Outrageous and dangerous demagoguery. This week, Rep. Waters did the very thing she voted to impeach Trump for.

America’s system of justice is not determined by Waters’ personal beliefs.

Pelosi must address the hypocrisy of her own caucus and hold her accountable!

The Woke Left Continues to Abandon Law Enforcement
You'd think that the mayor of a city where 20-plus people were shot last weekend – one death being a 7-year-old girl – would support their law enforcement more.

Unfortunately, common sense and backing the blue isn't on the woke Left's agenda.

This Is Not How Governing Should Work
 Calling Biden’s $2 trillion infrastructure bill a “Trojan horse” isn’t an exaggeration.

Democrats are listing every imaginable item on the liberal agenda as “infrastructure” and forcing YOU to pay for it. This is not how governing should work!

12/22/20 12:43,Relief Is On The Way,"The Durbin Report: A message from Senator Richard J. Durbin 



Fellow Illinoisan,   Last week, a group of Democrats and Republicans—including myself—came together and introduced compromise emergency COVID-19 relief legislation in the areas where we could agree. It wasn’t perfect by any means, but it was a start.    Our bipartisan bill quickly became the catalyst for larger relief negotiations. And those negotiations eventually led to the $900 billion bipartisan COVID-19 emergency relief legislation that Congress passed this week. 

DURBIN SHARES SUPPORT FOR BIPARTISAN COVID-19 EMERGENCY RELIEF LEGISLATION 
Like all compromises, the final relief bill is not perfect.  I’m disappointed that we weren’t able to agree on including much-needed funding for states and localities in this package.  I want to be clear:  I’m not giving up on funding for states and localities.  This funding is essential in our fight against the pandemic and for our economic recovery.   However, this legislation includes many important provisions including extending crucial unemployment benefits for hundreds of thousands of Illinoisans; offering a lifeline to struggling small businesses and nonprofits; providing direct checks to millions of American families; and providing funding for vaccine distribution, nutrition assistance, rental assistance, our hospitals and health care clinics, schools and universities, transit systems, and more.    As we continue to face this unprecedented public health crisis, I believe that more funding will be needed.  But this emergency relief will help us weather a tough winter ahead and should be signed by President Trump without delay.   Sincerely,   U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL)   PS—If you are interested in finding out more about what is contained in the relief package, or how it will affect Illinois, check out this webpage.

Honoring Our Law Enforcement Across CA-39


Our law enforcement officers across California’s 39th District and our nation put their lives on the line every day to protect and serve our communities. 

I’m proud to support our law enforcement and their important, hard work they do each day. From Captain Steven Tousey and Deputy Louis Denver with the Walnut Diamond Bar Sheriff’s Office in Los Angeles County, who I rode along with last week, to Orange County Sheriff Don Barnes and their hardworking team, I’m always talking to our law enforcement across Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties on how I can help make sure they have the support and resources needed to perform their demanding and dangerous jobs, and learn how I can support our police officers in Congress.  

As we celebrate National Police Week and every day, we thank our law enforcement for the work that they do to keep us safe. Click HERE or on the above image to watch my full speech on the House floor. 

Securing our Border and Fixing our Broken Immigration System


After visiting the Southern border in California and in Texas, it's clear there's a public health and humanitarian crisis at our border. 

It’s also clear that while we need to come together to address the root causes of mass migration, recent policy changes made by the Biden administration are contributing to this crisis and hurting Americans, straining our Border Patrol and Customs and Border Protection officers on the front lines, endangering migrants who are making the perilous journey to the U.S. in search of a better life, and undermining legal immigrants. 

Read my full thoughts here.

Fighting for the 57/60 Confluence Project


Since coming to Congress, I’ve made the 57/60 Freeway Confluence Project a top priority by requesting funding and educating my colleagues on the impacts of the Confluence in CA-39. 

I caught up with City of Diamond Bar Mayor Nancy Lyons, City of Industry Mayor Cory Moss and Director of Public Policy for the San Gabriel Valley Economic Partnership joined me for a press conference at the 57/60 Confluence site to share an update on the status of the project and why Congress should join me in funding this vital infrastructure project. 

Paying Respect to Fallen Buena Park Police Officers


The Buena Park Police Department has sadly lost four officers in the line of duty. My team joined the family members of the fallen officers and the Buena Park Police for the unveiling of their Fallen Officer Memorial and to remember the lives of the men who sacrificed their lives protecting Buena Park. 

We remember Detective Darrel Cate, Deputy Shayne Daniel York, Corporal Tyler Matthew Pinchot and Officer Daniel Ryan Ackerman. We remember your names and honor and thank you always.

Pursuing The American Dream


It's an honor to be able to represent the community I've called home for decades in Congress and to be one of the first Korean American women elected to serve. 

I hope my story can inspire others to pursue their American dream just like I did.

Supporting Human Rights and Freedom in Vietnam


I joined a bipartisan group of colleagues to introduce the Vietnam Human Rights Act. This bill will prioritize U.S. foreign policy to help the Vietnamese people as they struggle for freedom and human rights. 

I will always stand firmly for human rights and with the Vietnamese people.

Helping our Small Businesses Innovate


One of the many reasons America is the leader in science and technology is because of public, private partnerships between the federal government and small businesses. To remain the leader in technological development, we must prioritize the effective use of resources to commercialize new technologies. 

During this week's Small Business Committee hearing, I asked how the government can best partner with small businesses to bring new technology to the marketplace and keep our competitive advantage over countries worldwide.  

Recognizing CA-39 Small Businesses


As our community begins to reopen from the COVID-19 pandemic, I hope that each of us can make an effort to support small businesses and entrepreneurs. Small businesses have had a hard time throughout the past year, and it is important that we support them. 

My team was honored to be at the grand opening of the new Crumbl Cookies location in La Habra to recognize this accomplishment. I am proud to advocate for entrepreneurs on the Small Business Committee in Congress and our district.

2/13/21 12:04,Rep. Grothman Newsletter- Vitamin D Resolution,"Vitamin D Resolution
 
On Thursday, I introduced a House Resolution to recognize the significant role vitamin D may play in the fight against COVID-19.
 
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, I have shared research about the possible benefits of vitamin D for COVID-19 prevention, referencing medical research studies out of Northwestern University, University of Chicago, and Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, to name a few. These studies show a strong correlation between vitamin D deficiencies and negative COVID-19 patient outcomes, including severe symptoms, hospital stays, ICU admittance, and overall mortality rate. Furthermore, the studies suggest those with healthy vitamin D levels are likely to fare much better against COVID-19 infection because of the benefits vitamin D intake can have for overall respiratory health and immune response.
 
This past September, Dr. Anthony Fauci endorsed taking vitamin D supplements for immune system health and function. In December, 120 health, science, and medical experts from the U.S., U.K., and Europe sent an open letter to world governments stating that there is clear evidence that Vitamin D reduces COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths.
 
During the early stages of COVID-19, the world was in need of a treatment for this virus while we awaited a safe, effective vaccine. While we now have vaccines to prevent COVID-19, not everyone has access to them yet, there are two existing COVID variants we know of, and people are still dying from the illness every day.
 
We have been told to listen to the science regarding COVID-19 since its inception. Now, 120 doctors from several of the world’s most prestigious medical institutions concur that there is overwhelming evidence that vitamin D can be effective in decreasing the severity of COVID-19, but our government’s top public health agencies still have not pursued this credible lead. The unwillingness of these agencies to investigate this lead has undoubtedly cost many lives.
 
I am once again calling on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and National Institutes of Health (NIH) to study the connection between vitamin D deficiencies and COVID-19 and let the public know how this could help in our fight against the virus, just as they have with other prevention methods during the pandemic.
  
 
Workplace Choice for Individuals with Disabilities
 
During my time as a state legislator, I made it a point to be an advocate for individuals with disabilities. The love, laughter, and pride they bring to everyone around them is something to be cherished and celebrated. I have taken this attitude with me to Washington, DC and continue to look out for their best interest.
 
Democrats have included the elimination of Section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act in the stimulus package they are currently pushing through Congress. This section of the Fair Labor Standards Act allows certain organizations, known as Community Rehabilitation Providers (CRPs) to pay individuals with disabilities a special minimum wage. Some balk at the prospect of paying someone a special minimum wage, but the reality of the situation is different from the theory.
 
I introduced an amendment during the House Committee on Education and Labor markup of the FY2021 budget bill that would maintain Section 14(c) and the employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities it provides. Sadly, this amendment was swiftly rejected by the Democrat-controlled Committee. Click below to watch me introduce my amendment and speak to the importance of preserving workplace choice and flexibility for individuals with disabilities.
  
 

 
  
Here are some other common misconceptions about CRPs:
 
	•	Q: Don't individuals with disabilities deserve enough money to live?
	•	A: Yes. However, individuals who work at CRPs under 14(c) certificates have access to benefits like Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid.
 
	•	Q: Why do these individuals work at a CRP if they don't need the money?
	•	A: For anyone, having a steady job and earning a paycheck is a point of pride. These individuals deserve the dignity that comes from feeling productive and contributing to society.
 
	•	Q: Why don't these individuals get a job outside of the CRP? 
	•	A: Many do! CRPs are set up to assist individuals with disabilities in their work and teach them valuable skills, including how to operate in the workplace. Many people work for a CRP for a period of time, then use those skills to get a job elsewhere. Most people who do gain employment elsewhere, however, are only able to work four or five hours per week, so many retain their job at the CRP in addition to working part-time for another employer.
 
	•	Q: Shouldn't individuals with disabilities be paid $15/hour instead of the CRP's profits going toward making the executives richer?
	•	A: CRPs are most often non-profit and money they do make is reinvested back into the company to assist the employees. I have been told separately and on more than one occasion by different CRPs in Wisconsin's Sixth District that if government regulations require CRPs to pay $15/hour, they would likely be forced to lay-off all employees and close their doors permanently.
 
	•	Q: Why would it be bad if CRPs closed permanently?
	•	A: The individuals who work there would lose their job and many would be relegated to adult daycare. Employees of CRPs all over the Sixth District have told me that while it's nice to have a paycheck and some spending money, their favorite part about having a job is that they get to be with their friends at work. This support system is not available to them with other employers, which is why many have more than one job.
 
Oversight Committee Amendments
 
On Friday, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform held its own markup on sections of the FY2021 budget bill that fall under the committee's purview, including $350 billion earmarked for state and local governments. To these sections, I offered three amendments.
 
The first would help restore the jobs lost by President Biden's misguided decision to shut down construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. We are in a recession due to COVID-19 and on day one, President Biden issued an executive order that will cost our country at least 11,000 jobs, hundreds of which are in Wisconsin. My amendment would ensure that funds are not distributed until the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline resumes.
 
The second would ensure sanctuary cities and jurisdictions are not rewarded for refusing to follow federal immigration law. These cities include Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Baltimore and dozens more large, medium, and small cities throughout the country. Those jurisdictions do not cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials and decline to comply with lawfully issued orders to hold individuals (these orders are called “detainers”) from federal law enforcement agencies, like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), meaning dangerous gang members are then released back into their communities to reoffend. Just last year in Baltimore, a 16-year-old girl was murdered. Five suspects were charged with murder in the first degree, assault in the first degree, kidnapping, conspiracy to commit first degree assault, and conspiracy to commit kidnapping. ICE issued detainers on three of these individuals. In addition to being illegally present in the United States, they are members of the ruthless MS-13 gang. Two of these suspects had previous ICE detainers placed on them for past crimes but were released because of sanctuary policies. These criminal illegal immigrants and dangerous MS-13 gang members should have never had the opportunity to murder this teenage girl. My amendment would prohibit federal funding to areas that ignore these commonsense laws. 
 
The third would prevent a federal bailout of chronically mismanaged state and local public pension funds. For example, the Illinois state public pension fund is in disrepair because of misguided decisions made by the people in charge of the fund. On the opposite side of the spectrum, Wisconsin's state public pension fund is healthy because it has been managed responsibly. My amendment would prohibit COVID-19 funding from being used to bailout these mismanaged state and local public pension funds.
 
Unfortunately, the Democrat-controlled House Committee on Oversight and Reform did not adopt any of my amendments.

Dear Friend,  
Happy Valentine's Day!
 
This week I had my first House Ways and Means Committee markup! A markup is a meeting of the Committee where we go through each line in a piece of legislation and ""mark"" it up before it gets voted on by the full House of Representatives. This week we marked up Democrats' expensive and partisan spending bill that includes COVID-19 relief.
 
The past COVID-19 relief packages have been negotiated on a bipartisan basis. Unfortunately, the same can't be said about this most recent package. This new legislation was written behind closed doors, includes a significant amount of liberal ""wish list"" items, and is being jammed through Congress by obscure legislative procedures. For a party that preaches unity, this is not unity from House Democrats.
 
There are still unused funds from past COVID-19 relief legislation that need to be used before we pass another piece of costly legislation. We need to target the communities that need the aid most, which is why in this week's markup I offered an amendment that would allocate emergency funds proportionately based on the number of children living in poverty in each state. It would ensure the funding in this spending bill effectively helps combat child poverty in West Virginia and across the country by targeting resources to states that need it most, not just allocating it to states with the largest populations as originally proposed in the package.
 
Sadly, every single Democrat on the Committee voted against this commonsense amendment.

5/7/21 18:13,Creating Jobs through Clean Energy,"May 7, 2021
 
Hello Friends,
 
This week, as our ongoing efforts to recover and rebuild from the COVID-19 pandemic continued, I joined my colleagues in Congress and industry experts to discuss expanding our energy infrastructure to build a more resilient, sustainable energy grid. The COVID-19 public health and economic crises have highlighted the urgent need to bolster our energy infrastructure to ensure no one is left without the support they need. 
 
This past year has also shown the national threat that climate change poses and how important it is for our planet and our economy to invest in clean energy to create jobs and preserve our natural resources for generations to come. 
 
  
 
Taking Action on Climate Change in Congress
 
  
 

 
The transportation sector is the number one source of carbon emissions in the U.S. — we have the opportunity to decarbonize our electric grid, transition to electric vehicles, and reduce carbon pollution.
 
This week in the Energy and Commerce Energy Subcommittee, I questioned experts about building out a robust network of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations around the country. These stations can’t be isolated to urban areas, or along major highways — we need policies to pave the way for EV charging stations to operate in rural communities, too. One of the major barriers to building charging stations in rural communities are fees called “demand charges,” which electric companies place on businesses with charging stations. In rural, less populated areas, these fees can be extremely high. In New Hampshire, this means small businesses and towns can’t afford to operate EV charging stations. 
 
I look forward to working with my colleagues to resolve this important barrier to expanding clean energy infrastructure in our state.
 
  

In Congress, I’m working to build a more sustainable, resilient energy future.
 
On Wednesday, I joined Dartmouth for the “Investing in our Energy Futures” virtual conference to discuss steps we need to take to build the clean energy economy of the future. We are at a critical moment for our nation’s energy future, and we have the opportunity to take bold, transformative steps forward to create a more resilient, more sustainable grid. It was great to talk with experts about steps we can take in the public and private sectors to ensure we are investing in our nation’s energy infrastructure to be competitive for generations to come.
 
Through innovative legislative solutions and pioneering public-private partnerships, we are building the framework necessary to bolster energy production, create good-paying jobs, and save our planet.
 
  
 
Lowering the Cost of Prescription Drugs
 
  

For too long, Americans have been grappling with the skyrocketing costs of prescription drugs. The status quo is unacceptable.
 
On Tuesday, I joined an Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee hearing and questioned experts on steps Congress can take to ensure no American has to choose between the prescription medications they need and necessities like food or rent. Regardless of party affiliation or where you live, Americans in every corner of our country are seeing more of their hard-earned dollars go towards life-saving treatments and prescription drugs. That is why I partnered with my colleague Rep. David McKinley to introduce the Ensuring Access to Lower-Cost Medicines for Seniors Act to create billions in savings for Medicare Part D beneficiaries. 

I look forward to working across the aisle on the Energy and Commerce Committee to advance this beneficial legislation and lower prescription drug costs for Americans in the Granite State and across the country.
 
  
 
Addressing the Substance Use Crisis
 
  

Last week, the Bipartisan Addiction and Mental Health Task Force held our first roundtable.
 
In order to truly address the substance abuse crisis and end the cycle of addiction, we must ensure that treatment is available and accessible to those in need — including justice-involved individuals. Mental health and substance use treatment throughout our criminal justice system has been inadequate for decades, but we still act shocked when people continue to struggle with addiction after incarceration and recidivism is high. We’re not surprised when a person with diabetes gets worse if they go without their treatment, and we need to start thinking about addiction in the same way.

I look forward to continuing to work with my co-chairs on the Bipartisan Addiction and Mental Health Task Force as we focus on prevention and treatment efforts and advance evidence-based policies to end the addiction and mental health crises in America.
 
  
 
Ending Hate Against the AAPI Community
 
  

I thank all of our panelists for joining this incredibly important conversation and for sharing their stories — we can and must do more to end Asian hate.
 
This morning, I hosted a virtual roundtable with members of the New Hampshire Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Community to discuss racist bullying and hateful rhetoric and ongoing efforts in Congress and New Hampshire to end Asian hate. I was proud to be joined by my dear friend and colleague, Rep. Grace Meng (NY-06), whose legislation, the COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act, I cosponsored.
 
I’m so grateful to the members of the NH AAPI Community who joined this conversation and thank them for sharing their heart-wrenching stories here in NH – their words and experiences highlight the necessity of comprehensive legislation to address and end Asian hate. I am committed to addressing the rise in anti-Asian hate and to protecting all Granite Staters and all Americans from hatred and bigotry in all forms.
 
We can and must do better with education and training in our schools and communities about diversity and inclusion.
 
  
 
Supporting Women in Our COVID-19 Recovery
 
  

Today, I spoke with advocates and New Hampshire Women’s Foundation members about support for Granite State women and families in the American Rescue Plan.
 
This afternoon, I was joined by State Senator Becky Whitley and New Hampshire Women’s Foundation leadership for a virtual roundtable to highlight wins for Granite State women and crucial support included in the American Rescue Plan Act, and to discuss the legislation’s positive impact on New Hampshire families. I pushed for the inclusion of key support for families in this transformative relief bill, including the expanded Child Tax Credit and additional Economic Impact Payments.

The American Rescue Plan Act represents the first major step forward as we recover from the COVID-19 public health emergency and work to build back better. The pandemic has had serious consequences for women in our state and across the nation with 1 in 4 American women leaving the workforce in the past year. I will continue leading efforts to secure additional support for women and families and ensure no one is left behind as we rebuild and recover.
 
  
 
News You Can Use
 
  

COVID-19 hit our NH restaurants hard, and help is available for those in need.
 
Starting this week, the U.S. Small Business Administration is accepting applications for the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. Created by the American Rescue Plan, the Restaurant Revitalization Fund provides $28.6 billion in direct relief funds to restaurants and other hard-hit food establishments that have experienced economic distress and significant operational losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The online application will remain open to any eligible establishment until all funds are exhausted.
 
Learn more and see if your business is eligible here.
 
  

Safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines continue to be some of our best tools to end this pandemic.
 
COVID-19 vaccines are key to ending this pandemic, and your local pharmacy could have vaccination appointments available! I encourage everyone to sign-up to get their vaccine as soon as they can to protect themselves, their loved ones, and our communities.

As always, the CDC and the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services are the best resources to turn to during the COVID-19 public health emergency. If you are sick, stay home and call your health care provider. If you live in NH and have questions about coronavirus, dial 2-1-1 or visit CDC.gov for more information.
 
To stay updated on my work in Congress and around the Granite State, as well as for important information and resources, like my page on Facebook and follow me on Twitter. 
 
With warmer days on the way and more shots being administered into arms every day, remember that we’re all in this together. Brighter days are ahead! I hope you have a safe and fun weekend!
 
Sincerely, 
 
Annie

Foxx Report
 
The nation and the world are reeling from the rioting and violence that occurred on January 6th in the United States Capitol. As law enforcement works to bring accountability and swift justice to the perpetrators involved that day, Congress must leave no stone unturned in its quest to examine this event. This tragedy must never happen again.
Joe Biden is the President-Elect. Period. I echo Leader McCarthy’s appeal to President Trump to call Joe Biden and acknowledge him on that basis. Many of my colleagues pointed to the process on January 6th as the day of “ultimate significance” – in the words of the late Justice Ginsburg.  Unfortunately, those words now carry increasing weight and infamy. Truly, the election process is over, and we need to unify. 
As Congress, the American people, and the nation seek justice, the current calls for a “snap” impeachment and unprecedented, supra-Constitutional remedies must cease. We cannot abridge the safeguards that are explicitly used to enshrine justice in the name of justice itself. Speaker Pelosi’s march towards this “snap” process would abridge House rules, all known precedents, principles of due process and rights to a trial, and could possibly run afoul of the Constitution.
If my Democrat colleagues are focused on moving the country forward, they should work with Republicans to find appropriate remedies that don’t jeopardize that aim. President-Elect Biden will be sworn in on January 20th, and we must ensure a smooth and orderly transition of power. Another round of impeachment moves the needle further away from that outcome. 
I Will Never Stop Defending Life
The sanctity of life must be respected, and any institutions or organizations that conduct operations contrary to the preservation and defense of life must be excluded from subsidized funding by taxpayers for abortion services.
In 1970, when the Title X Family Planning Program was created, Congress issued a strong rebuke against abortion providers by not allowing funding under the title to be used for programs where abortion is considered a method of family planning. Since then, the original intent behind the law has been quashed repeatedly. Title X funds have been contributed to employee salaries, facility costs, and medical supplies for abortion providers. This must be corrected immediately.
The Protect Life Rule was an important step to end this exploitation of the law, and the Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act will make sure taxpayer dollars don’t subsidize abortion providers under any future Administrations. I’m proud to introduce this legislation and have 84 cosponsors joining me in defending life.  New Scam Alert
There’s no doubt that 2020 was fraught with scams that have defrauded countless North Carolinians across the state. You’ve likely seen my weekly scam updates, and I can assure you that these updates will continue this year. You deserve information on how to protect yourselves and your families from these rogue actors, and I will always keep you up to date.
This week let’s focus on a new threat: fraudulent telephone calls from scammers claiming to be CDC officials. As the COVID-19 vaccine is being distributed, many North Carolinians have received telephone calls from scammers asking for donations to help fund the distribution and administration of vaccines. They’ve even gone so far as to change their caller ID to display “Centers for Disease Control” to mislead those they call. Further, scammers will go on to ask if you would be willing to pay to receive a vaccine. 
Here’s the truth: the vaccine is free to everyone and it is funded by taxpayer dollars. In some instances, healthcare providers may charge an administrative fee for a vaccine, but it should be reimbursed by both private and public insurance companies. Online pharmacies are NOT reliable sources for receiving a vaccine.
I urge you to visit the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services website to find out what the planned phases are for vaccine distribution and other important information.
Have a blessed weekend.
Sincerely,

The Commonwealth is receiving $482 million from the American Rescue Plan to make up for lost revenues caused by the pandemic. The U.S. Treasury announced Monday the funds would be received in a single payment and that other relief funds for municipalities would be announced in the coming days.

Rescue Plan $482m available now

$481,876,521 from the American Rescue Plan’s Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds are now available for the Northern Mariana Islands. The U.S. Treasury announced the allocation of funds on Monday and opened the application portal. Congress appropriated $4.5 billion for the U.S. insular areas in the Rescue Plan on March 11. Half the money was divided evenly among the five areas, the other half was divided by population, a formula very favorable to the Marianas. Treasury also issued expanded guidance on how the money can be used to replace government revenue lost because of the pandemic. This will allow Commonwealth employees to be paid and continue to provide public services. Funds may also be used to provide job training and other assistance to unemployed workers, and direct aid to families facing food, housing, and other financial insecurity. Small businesses, particularly those in travel and tourism, may be given loans, grants, and counseling to help their recovery. Investment in water and sewer projects that align with the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Water State Revolving Fund and Drinking Water State Revolving Fund, which the Commonwealth receives, are allowed. And broadband infrastructure can be built out to meet the standard of 100 Mbps download and 100 Mbps upload speeds. Direct aid to households to support internet access at these speeds is another eligible use of the American Rescue Plan grant to the Commonwealth. 
 

$1.4m in airport improvement grants

The Commonwealth Ports Authority is receiving $1,388,888 in FY2021 Airport Improvement Program funds for infrastructure and safety projects, the FAA announced Thursday. $1 million of the grant award will be used to conduct a new pavement management study for Saipan, Rota, and Tinian International Airports. A second project, worth $388,888, will prepare an airport safety management system manual and implementation plan that meets FAA requirements. A portion of the AIP grants is provided by the American Rescue Plan Act that included $8 billion to be awarded as economic assistance to eligible airports to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. Congratulations to CPA. 
 

$300k for Garapan cleanup

The Marianas is receiving $300,000 for assessment and cleanup of the Lower West Takpochao Planning Area in Garapan, the Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday. The Marianas is one of 151 communities nationwide receiving a Brownfields Multipurpose, Assessment, and Cleanup grant. The money can be used to assess and clean contaminated and abandoned industrial and commercial properties. EPA says residential properties near brownfield sites have been shown to increase in value by 5% to 15.2% as a result of cleanup activities.
 
 
 

$2.4m for CHCC vaccination work

The Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation is receiving $2,383,674 to pay for personnel costs related to administration of the COVID-19 vaccines, the Federal Emergency Management Agency informed your congressional office on Monday. The funds are intended to cover 100 percent of the money CHCC pays staff from May 12, 2021 through August 12, 2021. FEMA obligates the funds directly to the Commonwealth government, which is then responsible for conveying the money to the Healthcare Corporation. Congratulations to CHCC, which to date has received $3,612,310.27 under the pandemic major disaster declaration.
 
 

Rose Cuison-Villazor, Vice Dean and Professor of Law at Rutgers University, was among the witnesses I called for a hearing I chaired this week on a resolution urging the courts to abandon reliance on the racist Insular Cases. Professor Villazor grew up in the Marianas and has written extensively on the Insular Cases in the California Law Review, Harvard Law Review Forum, and other publications. 

Rejecting the “Insular Cases”

Addressing America’s legacy of racism is the purpose of H. Res. 279, the “Insular Cases Resolution,” and the reason for Wednesday’s hearing on the bill. The bipartisan resolution, introduced by Natural Resources Committee Chair Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), places the House of Representatives on record as rejecting the racist reasoning of the Insular Cases – a series of Supreme Court decisions made beginning in 1901 concerning the constitutional rights afforded to residents in U.S. overseas territories. For over a century, these rulings have been used to block equal treatment under the law and access to essential federal programs for the people in the U.S. insular areas. They are long overdue to be overturned. This must be done, however, as I explained in my opening statement, with respect for each territory. The Insular Cases have been used to preserve the local Matai culture in American Samoa, for instance, and to justify the restrictions on land ownership in Article XII of the Northern Marianas Constitution. But given recent rulings on the illegitimacy of policies based on racial classifications and given the conservative makeup of the current judiciary, reliance on the Insular Cases to defend Article XII seems unwise. One of the hearing witnesses, former Saipan resident, Professor Rose Cuison-Villazor shared that assessment. Watch our exchange here. 
 
 

Strategizing the Pacific. Hawaii Representatives Ed Case and Kaialiʻi Kahele and I got together Friday to discuss a range of issues affecting the Marianas, Hawaii, and the wider Pacific region. One particular concern we share is expiration of the Compacts of Free Association between the U.S. and the freely associated states. With foreign powers eager to exert influence in the FAS, we should ensure that the U.S. helps advance their economic development and self-sufficiency, while U.S. national security strategy and diplomacy is maintained. Funding must also be made available to territories and states to help defray costs associated with hosting COFA migrants. 
 

H-2B policy update

On Thursday, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services issued new guidance to implement the H-2B exemptions for certain projects in the Northern Marianas and Guam. Section 9502 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2021 (Public Law 116-283) allows employers to petition for H-2B Temporary Non-Agricultural Workers without having to demonstrate that the service or labor is temporary if the project supports or is adversely affected by the military buildup. All other H-2B requirements must be met. The policy applies to H-2B petitions requesting employment start dates on or before December 31, 2023. Employers seeking to file under the updated policy are encouraged to visit the H-2B page and policy guidance on the USCIS website. 
 

Biometrics suspended for some

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced the temporary suspension of the biometrics requirements through May 17, 2023  for certain nonimmigrants filing the I -539, Application to Extend /Change Nonimmigrant Status. The temporary suspension applies to five classifications including E-2 CNMI Investors and L-2 nonimmigrants, who have a pending I-539 as of May 17, 202 and have not received a biometrics appointment, or who submit new applications on or after  May 17, 2021. Go to the USCIS website for additional information and requirements. 
 
 

Tell your story. Whether you’re an educator with exciting new research, an organization with an innovative concept, or a family on the frontlines, your voice deserves to be heard, says Rules Committee Chair Jim McGovern. He is inviting Americans to share their story and help guide our work to finally end hunger now. “We have the food, the ability, and the means to end hunger in America — what we lack is the political will and moral courage to act. We must change that."" Tell your story here. 
 
 

API Heritage Month Essay Contest. In celebration of API Heritage Month, I am hosting the congressional office’s first ever API Heritage Month Essay Contest. This contest is a chance for middle school and high school students in the Northern Marianas to reflect on their experiences and share their stories about growing up within the Asian and Pacific Islander community. One middle school winner and one high school winner will be selected to have their essay published in the Congressional Record. For more information and to participate in this year’s contest, visit the contest webpage at sablan.house.gov.

12/7/20 20:07,Why Congressman McCaul will be getting the COVID-19 vaccine,"In Case You Missed It:
McCaul discusses COVID-19 vaccine
In a recent interview published by the Houston Chronicle, Congressman Michael McCaul discusses why he will be getting the COVID-19 vaccine and his support for Operation Warp Speed.  
Recent Updates on COVID-19 
Just last week, Governor Greg Abbott announced that Texas will receive 1.4 million first round doses of the vaccine for healthcare and frontline workers and those who are vulnerable. 
Austin and Houston city officials are preparing administer the vaccine pending the approval from the Food and Drug Administration.  
McCaul's thoughts on the COVID-19 vaccine  
(The below article was originally published online by the Houston Chronicle) 
With a COVID-19 vaccine on the horizon, the community is cautiously hopeful for an end to the pandemic. Congressman Michael McCaul, representative for District 10, has been a key player in working alongside the medical community to see to it that a safe, effective vaccine could be developed and made available to the public quickly.  McCaul was a major proponent of Operation Warp Speed, a U.S. government initiative dedicated to facilitating and accelerating the development, manufacturing and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments.  McCaul discussed the process of working behind the scenes to advance vaccine availability and when the residents of District 10 can expect to have access to it.  This is the first time in history that we’ve gotten a vaccine so quickly. Did you do anything to encourage the expedited process? Tell us about your involvement and why you championed this cause.   I sent a letter in March to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar asking them about a plan to scale-up vaccine distribution, previewing the agency’s work for what was to become Operation Warp Speed. This pandemic has killed over one million people globally and cost Americans thousands of jobs, and I wanted to do something about it. In Phase I of COVID-19 relief, I voted for $8.3 billion to kick-start the COVID response, including the development of a vaccine. Before the pandemic, I had the foresight to advocate for increased funding for the National Institute of Health, which has played an instrumental part in combating this virus.  What was it like working with the medical community to bring this potentially lifesaving vaccine to the American people?   I think it’s truly remarkable how quickly this vaccine was safely and effectively manufactured and will soon be approved. In a matter of months, we were able to come up with not one, but three different promising COVID-19 vaccines. To put this into perspective, it took six years to approve a vaccine for Ebola. It is evident that Operation Warp Speed has been a complete success and I am proud to have supported funding that made the development of this vaccine possible.  You support a lot of causes that involve the medical world. You’re working to combat childhood cancer and the global AIDS crisis, for example. How did your involvement in the battle against COVID-19 compare to those experiences?   My work combating the global AIDS crisis and childhood cancer prepared me to address a life-threatening global issue, like COVID-19. I was able to advocate for NIH funding and make connections with key players at HHS and NIH prior to COVID-19 - which was very effective in understanding the resources available to help the American people defeat this virus.  There is a lot of apprehension surrounding the vaccine, especially because it was approved so quickly. In the past, we’ve seen devastating results to medical treatments that were pushed through too quickly. How can people trust that this vaccine is safe?   The Food and Drug Administration did not compromise safety in the process of developing an effective vaccine. I have talked to Secretary Azar regarding safety issues, and he has assured me that the vaccine is very safe.  I think understanding what is in the vaccine is also a comfort - so let’s discuss that for a moment. Unlike other vaccines, the COVID-19 vaccine is not cell-based, meaning it does not use an inactivated germ to help build antibodies, rather the vaccine uses mRNA to teach our cells how to make antibodies to fight off the virus. You can read more about how the vaccine works on CDC’s website too.  Should people who are low-risk for complications due to COVID-19 still get the shot?   For any health question you may have, I think it is first and foremost important to consult with your doctor. In my opinion, I do believe that it is safe for everyone to get the vaccine - but again if you have questions, I recommend consulting your doctor.   Will you be getting the vaccine yourself? If so, do you know when you’ll be receiving it?   Once the vaccine is available and I am eligible to receive it, I will do so as soon as possible. I believe the vaccine is critical to the public health of our nation, which in turn will get our economy back on track to support hard working Americans. I will be encouraging everyone to have faith in the science and take the vaccine.  When can the residents of your district expect to be able to get the shot?   December 14th is when the first batch of vaccines will go in Texas. I must commend Governor Abbott for his plan in distributing the vaccine - as soon as it is approved, the state will begin administering it. At first it will go to our health care and frontline workers and then the vulnerable populations. I am hopeful that by spring 2021 most Americans will be able to get the vaccine. Dr. Fauci has predicted this could be the case.  What would you say to people who are afraid to get the vaccine?   I can understand why people could be fearful, we are all going through this unprecedented time together, and the unknown can be frightening. What always calms my nerves is looking to what I do know. We know that no steps were skipped in the process of safely and effectively manufacturing this vaccine and we know that those who have developed and are involved in its approval have the highest standards before releasing it to the public. These key things are great to focus on when you may start to feel uneasy. And again, I encourage anyone who is apprehensive to consult their doctor.

Dear friend,  
It's been two months since the American Rescue Plan, or ARP, was signed into law, and it's already accelerated South Florida's recovery. Here are highlights of what the plan did, and will do, for our community:
 
Improves Health Care Coverage
The American Rescue Plan reduces health care premiums for low- and middle-income families through 2022 and provides COBRA subsidies so workers who have been laid off or had their hours reduced can keep their doctors and their coverage.
 
Established a National Vaccine Campaign
We worked to ensure the plan provides more than $20 billion to establish a national COVID-19 Vaccination Program and additional funds to boost testing, equity, and supply chains.
 
Expanding Child Tax Credit and Cutting Child Poverty in Half
Benefits were set to run out March 14, but this plan extends them to September. It makes the child tax credit fully refundable for 2021, and lifts the annual amount to $3,000 per child ($3,600 for a child under age 6).

Support for Small Businesses
Small business are the backbone of our community. That's why the American Rescue Plan invests more than $50 billion into small businesses, providing $28.6 billion for restaurants, $15 billion for disaster loan grants of up to $10,000 per business, and additional funding for Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) forgivable loans.
 
Investments in Local Governments
To relieve the pandemic strain on local budgets, the ARP provides $360 billion for new Coronavirus Relief Funds for state and local government, including $10.2 billion for Florida to keep critical workers on the job.
 
Supports for Transit & Airline Workers
We can't return to normal without essential workers in the transportation industry, so the plan includes $30 billion for transit agencies nationwide to prevent, prepare, and respond to the continued threat of the pandemic.

A Return to Safe In-Person School
Every parent knows how important safe, in-person education is to a child's developments. I'm proud to say the American Rescue Plan invests $130 billion in K-12 education to improve ventilation systems, reduce class sizes, increase social distancing, and buy PPE.

News From the Tenth District
I know it’s Wednesday but it’s been a hectic start to the week so I was slightly delayed in writing this week’s newsletter. As always I hope you are safe and well.  To those fighting the virus this week, I continue to pray for a full and fast recovery.  To anyone who has lost a loved one to the virus, I extend my personal condolences. 
Last week the House returned to session following the Thanksgiving recess.  The three most critical matters before the end of the year are funding the Government through Fiscal Year 2021, passing the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and finding a compromise to pass a COVID Relief package.  
Yesterday, the House passed the NDAA yesterday and sent it to the President’s desk for signature.  President Trump has threatened a veto because the bill does not change policy affecting tech companies like Google and Facebook (nothing to do with national defense). The NDAA is a broad, bipartisan compromise that should be signed by the president without hesitation.  I expect that if there is a veto, Congress will likely override it sometime in January. 
As for FY21 funding, although negotiators are talking, a final deal has not yet been reached.  Tomorrow the House will therefore vote on a one week extension so that the government does not close down on December 11.  We expect to have an agreement sometime next week. 
Regarding COVID relief, last week, I joined with the almost 50 members of the Problem Solvers Caucus, Democrats and Republicans, to support a compromise COVID stimulus relief proposal. The proposal also has the support of a group in the Senate calling themselves the “908 Coalition,” after the $908 billion in support it would provide to Americans. The bipartisan, bicameral proposal has pushed leadership back to the negotiating table and I am cautiously optimistic that we will get a stimulus deal in the next week. On Monday, I discussed the contours of the deal on WBEZ‘s Reset with Susie An. 
While there is light at the end of the tunnel with new vaccines and hopefully a stimulus bill, we must remain resolute in our determination to keep each other healthy during this holiday season. I suspect you are tired of me repeating myself, but please, watch your distance, wash your hands, and wear a mask. And avoid gathering indoors if possible. 
Closer to home, this Saturday I hosted the second session for this year’s STEM Scholars Program.  We were joined by an amazing group of employees from Valent BioSciences in Libertyville who shared information about their work in agricultural healthcare (or bio rational solutions), as well as insights on building a successful STEM career.Thanks so much to Dr. Warren Shafer,  Dr. Greg Venberg and the entire VBC team. 

Lastly, on Thursday I am hosting my final Telephone Town Hall of 2020.  It’s been a minute because of the 90 day communication blackout before the election, so I am excited to catch up and share information about what’s happening with the coronavirus and the status of a potential relief package.  
If you’d like to dial into my Town Hall at 6pm on Thursday, you can dial into the English line at 855-859-7337 or into the Spanish line at 855-962-1312. 
Please continue reading for more details on this and other happenings. 
  
COVID IN THE DISTRICT
COVID cases continue to rage in our area, and around the country. In total, Illinois has recorded more than 800,000 COVID cases and, tragically, 14,390 COVID-related deaths. Cook County reported 26,324 new cases last week. In Lake County, we have seen 3,336 new cases in just the last seven days. 
On a positive note, the trend numbers in Illinois are starting to move in the right direction with the seven day average of new cases trending slightly down. Maybe we are beginning to see the effect of more people wearing masks and following safety guidelines.  Great if so, but we need to remain diligent.  We are so close to getting this pandemic behind us, but only if we continue to work together to keep each other safe. 
If you think you might have COVID or possibly have been exposed to someone who has, please get tested [Lake County] [Cook County]. Waukegan is offering free testing for all county residents with a site located on Water St. In Arlington Heights, you can get tested at the Arlington Racetrack. In North Chicago, you can go to the Lake County Health Department Respiratory Illness Clinic for a test by appointment. And Advocate Aurora Health System is offering COVID-19 testing. 
Mobile Testing in Lake County 
Free Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) testing is coming to Grayslake. A mobile testing unit managed by the Illinois Department of Public Health will be stationed: 
  
Monday, December 14, 8 a.m. – 4 p.m. 
College of Lake County 
19351 West Washington Street, Grayslake 
  
Assistance is Available 
In these difficult times, many Americans are struggling. 
If you or someone you know needs food, you can find your nearest food pantry or program here. If you have a problem with unemployment or other state issues, please contact your state elected official. Another excellent resource is 211 Lake County, operated by the United Way. 
If you live in Cook County and need help paying your mortgage due to the Coronavirus pandemic, you can apply for mortgage assistance here through Cook County.
Qualifying Cook County constituents can get a one-time $600 payment for COVID assistance through the Cook County Government. If you have experienced hardship due to unpaid leave, care for vulnerable or infected relatives, or loss of wages due to business or school closures, please consider applying. If you are dealing with an eviction or debt issue or are behind on your mortgage or property tax payments, Cook County residents can receive free legal aid through the Cook County Legal Aid for Housing and Debt, a county-wide initiative to help resolve eviction, foreclosure, debt, and tax deed issues.
Currently, Zion Township has access to CARE Act funding that will assist with COVID-19 related financial needs. The application deadline is December 15th. If you or someone you know is struggling with rent, a mortgage payment, or paying an electric bill, Zion Township may be able to help. 
  
More Help for Small Businesses Available 
There may still be funds available through the Illinois Business Interruption Grant Program (BIG). BIG is available for small businesses in Illinois. The program will provide $220 million in funds for small businesses hit hardest by the ongoing pandemic.  Applications are open here. If you run a local small business, I encourage you to review and apply for this funding. 
  
Get a Flu Shot 
This year, containing the spread of the flu is more important than ever. Help reduce the strain on our frontline workers fighting Covid by rolling your sleeve up and getting a flu shot. You can find more information on how to receive a vaccination here. 
  

  
Congress Back in Session
In addition to finalizing FY2021 funding, passing the National Defense Authorization Act, and most urgent, but also possibly most challenging, convincing Senate Majority Leader to agree to a COVID Relief Package, Congress passed other important legislation last week.  Perhaps most newsworthy was passage of the MORE Act that decriminalized marijuana at the federal level. As well, we passed several bills to help small businesses, include modernizing the Small Business. Administrations Advantage Loan Program, increasing the maximum loan available to small manufacturers.  And. We passed the Big Cat Public Safety Act to improve conditions for captive big cats and reduce public contact with these animals to. Protect both people and the animals. 
Returning to COVID relief, iIt is imperative that we help Americans get through the darkness of winter, when we expect to see an explosion of COVID cases impact every part of our society –  from small businesses, to frontline workers, and health care providers.  Our proposal contains the following  elements: 
	•	State, Local, and Tribal Governments- $160 billion 
	•	Additional Unemployment Insurance (UI)- $180 billion 
	•	Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) including restaurants, stages, and deductibility- $288 billion
	•	CDFI/MDI Community Lender Support- $12 billion
	•	Tansportation (Airlines, Airports, Buses, Transit and Amtrak)- $45 billion
	•	Vaccine Development and Distribution and Testing and Tracing- $16 billion
	•	Healthcare Provider Relief Fund- $35 billio
	•	Education Funding- $82 billion
	•	Student Loans- $4 billion
	•	Housing Assistance (Rental)- $25 billion
	•	Nutrition/Agriculture- $26 billion
	•	U. Postal Service- $10 billion
	•	Child Care- $10 billion
	•	Dedicated Broadband Funding- $10 billion
	•	Opioid Funding- $5 billion
  
Getting Seniors the Health Care They Deserve 
This week, the House passed my bill, the BENES Act, which would prevent Medicare late enrollment penalties. 
In the middle of this stifling pandemic, the BENES Act is proof that Republicans and Democrats can come together to help more older Americans get the quality health care they deserve. 
Learn more about the BENES Act here. 
  
Vaccine Update 
This week, we learned that the Trump Administration passed when Pfizer offered to sell more vaccine doses to the United States over the summer. The Administration’s self-sabotage of our COVID response is appalling and an American embarrassment. They never had a plan. Whether it’s an offer to send masks to every American or pre-purchase extra vaccine doses, every time they’ve been offered help, they’ve turned it down! 
In September, the House passed my COVID PREPARE Act, a bill designed to reduce the exact kind of ad-hoc decision-making that has crippled America under the Trump Administration. The bill has been sitting on Senator McConnell’s desk, waiting while Americans suffer. 
  
Requesting Tickets to the Inauguration 
The Inauguration of President-Elect Joe Biden and Vice President-Elect Kamala Harris will be historic and an unprecedented undertaking in the midst of the pandemic. Though we do not yet have any details, I trust that the January 20th Inauguration Ceremony will be exceptionally well done with protections in place for the public health. 
The JCCIC typically provides members of Congress with a limited number of viewing area tickets to distribute, most of which are for a standing area near the east end of the National Mall. Because of the coronavirus and changing public health guidance, the inaugural ceremony will likely look different than in years past. Unfortunately, this means we are limited in our ability to answer your questions about the event at this time. 
To request tickets, read the “Additional Information” section on my website and fill out the ""Ticket Request Form.” 
  
AROUND THE DISTRICT
Sydney Barber 
If you haven’t yet read about the remarkable Sydney Barber, this week the Chicago Tribune published a feature on her work as the first Black woman named brigade commander at the US Naval Academy. Her achievements should be celebrated by the entire Tenth District and represent the commitment to service that ripples throughout our whole community. 
  
Open Enrollment Is Now
We are currently in Open Enrollment – the yearly period when people can enroll in a health insurance plan. The Open Enrollment period runs through December 15th. Whether you are looking to get covered or are already covered, I encourage you to visit healthcare.gov and shop around. During this COVID pandemic, having access to affordable, quality health coverage is more important than ever. Don’t go uncovered. Go to healthcare.gov and find a quality, affordable plan that works for you. 
  
Those interested in finding a plan on an ACA Marketplace should watch my workshop with Get Covered Illinois this week. 

Those interested in Medicare Open Enrollment can find a useful presentation from SHIP Coordinator Melissa Versch on the Medicare Plan Finder here. 

  
  
Brad’s Bookworms 
I am challenging local elementary students to read ten books before December 31st. This year will mark the fourth year of Brad's Bookworms, and I expect this year's groups to read record-levels of books. Those with questions about participating are encouraged to call the Lincolnshire Office at (847) 383-4870 or email Alvaro.Melara@mail.house.gov 
TELEPHONE TOWN HALL 
On Thursday I am hosting my final Telephone Town Hall of 2020.  It’s been a minute because of the 90 day communication blackout before the election, so I am excited to catch up and share information about what’s happening with the coronavirus and the status of a potential relief package.  
If you’d like to dial into my Town Hall at 6pm on Thursday, you can dial into the English line at 855-859-7337 or into the Spanish line at 855-962-1312. 
  
IN CLOSING 
Some good news this week: we saw the first publicly-available world wide vaccinations take place in the United Kingdom. It was great watching the cheer and determination of one recipient, as he declared, “I hope I’m not going to have the bloody bug now. I don’t intend to have it, because I have granddaughters and I intend to live a long time to enjoy their lives… Well there’s no point in dying now, when I’ve lived this long, is there?”  Watch Mr. Kenyon here. 
Please continue to stay strong, stay safe and stay healthy.  We still have a long way to go in the fight to beat the pandemic and regain a sense of normalcy. But, as I talk every day with constituents, elected leaders, small business operators, nonprofit volunteers, and the like, I am constantly reminded of the strength or our communities and the humanity of our neighbors.  I know that together, united as one large community, one strong nation, we will get through this and see better days ahead. 
  
Stay hopeful, be inspired, and please, let’s work together keep each other healthy! 
Sincerely,   Bradley S. Schneider Member of Congress

Dear Friend,   I am writing to inform you that the special enrollment period to sign up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act Marketplace was extended until August 15. During this period, you can purchase health insurance or change your plan for 2021.   Please visit HealthCare.gov before August 15 to purchase coverage, compare plans, or check your eligibility. The ACA Marketplace has trained brokers available to help you find the plan that works best for you and your family and trained assistors available to help you fill out an application. To get free help from a local broker or assistor, please click here. You can also call the HealthCare.gov toll-free number at 1-800-318-2596.   Most people using HealthCare.gov qualify for financial assistance. As a result, 2 in 3 people could find plans for $10 per month or less last year. If you already had coverage through HealthCare.gov, there may be additional plans to compare and choose from, and you may save more by choosing a different plan for 2021.   All plans include essential health benefits such as coverage for doctors’ services, prescription drugs, pregnancy, childbirth, and mental health services. Plans also cover pre-existing conditions and preventive care, like vaccines, cancer screenings, fall prevention, and more. For more information on types of plans and coverage, please click here.  My team and I stand ready to help our community during this time of need. For resources to help you and your family navigate through COVID-19, please visit our website.

Dear Friend, 
I’m pleased to share that my bill, H.R. 3125 COVID-19 Emergency Medical Supplies Enhancement Act of 2021, passed the U.S. House of Representatives. The bipartisan bill will support the President’s use of the Defense Production Act (DPA) authorities to further advance the production, acquisition, and distribution of medical supplies used to help prevent the spread of COVID-19.   This bill also requires the administration to provide a report conveying the federal contracts awarded under DPA authorities and requires additional reporting on the percent of contracts awarded to small businesses. This report will allow us to track how the DPA has been used, and thus, see its essential impact on the production of medical materials, necessary to save lives.  Learn More.   As your representative, I am working to address important issues concerning our border region. In addition to my legislative work in Washington, my office is ready to help if you are experiencing issues with a federal agency. My team of experienced caseworkers will work on your behalf, answer any questions you may have, and ensure you receive a fair and timely response to your request.     This week, a constituent contacted our office seeking assistance with the IRS.  The constituent stated their family had not received their 2019 tax refund, 2020 tax refund, and their third economic impact payments.  My staff helped the constituent by contacting the IRS and requesting an update on the payment status.  The constituent and his spouse received all three funds, totaling in $12,400.        Learn more about contacting my office here.

Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 1.11.21
Monday, January 11, 2021 –                                 
Priorities for the New Congress
On January 20, Joe Biden will be sworn in as president of the United States. I will attend his inauguration, which I consider one of my duties as a Member of Congress.
I also consider it my duty to conduct rigorous oversight of any Administration to ensure it upholds the Constitution and carries out the laws we enact.
Earlier this year, I was sworn in for a new term. I am honored to represent you for another term in the U.S. House of Representatives.
The new Congress presents a chance to renew my work on priorities for the constituents of Virginia’s Ninth Congressional District.
Improving access to and lowering costs of health care remain among the topmost items on my agenda. The ongoing coronavirus pandemic obviously poses the most significant challenge in the health care space. Monitoring the rollout of new vaccines and therapeutics are a task for this phase of the pandemic, but this same task also points forward to a health care agenda beyond the pandemic.
The development of multiple safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines in Operation Warp Speed was a landmark accomplishment. It came about through a partnership between the Federal Government, private sector, and scientific institutions. Likewise, policies of the Federal Government must be geared toward promoting the development of new cures and treatments for other diseases and medical conditions through cooperation of these various sectors.
At the same time, the high cost of prescription drugs has long been a problem borne by Ninth District residents and a top concern. I have worked throughout my time in the House of Representatives on commonsense measures with bipartisan backing to address this problem.
In the last Congress, the bill passed by House Democrats pursued a different path, purporting to make drug prices affordable but only by a socialistic-style price control scheme that would have stifled innovation and new cures. That bill went nowhere. In this Congress, we have the chance to return to the bipartisan path that addresses costs without sacrificing development of new drugs and treatments.
Before the pandemic, I championed telehealth as a way to provide access to health care to more people, especially in rural and isolated areas such as those found in the Ninth District. The pandemic has increased the use of telehealth and shown just how valuable it can be. I will continue to advocate policies that encourage the use of telehealth to care for patients.
For telehealth to work at its best, communities need reliable internet access. Such access also enables economic growth, educational opportunities, and higher quality of life for residents.
I have supported legislative and regulatory measures that encourage the building out of broadband networks and promote other creative solutions, such as use of TV white spaces and satellite technology, to bring better service to more people. The work of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under outgoing Chairman Ajit Pai has been very beneficial in this effort. I will encourage the FCC to continue its efforts to close the digital divide as well as work on legislation in the halls of Congress.
Job creation and economic growth are essential so constituents of the Ninth District can support themselves and their families, communities can attract new residents, and local jurisdictions can fund their services. In Congress, support for this effort means calling for the right tax and regulatory policies that lead to investment, hiring, and wage growth.
I have introduced legislation on a regulatory change that I believe would support efficiency and productivity in manufacturing. The current New Source Review (NSR) program, meant to prevent pollution emissions from industrial facilities, actually discourages these facilities from making upgrades that would ultimately lead to lower emissions. My bill would reform these counterproductive rules so manufacturers and others can make pollution-reducing upgrades to their facilities without running afoul of the Environmental Protection Agency.
The new Congress and Administration may look different, but my objective in the House of Representatives remains the same: to be a voice for the liberties, priorities, and needs of the people of Virginia’s Ninth Congressional District.
If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office.  You can call my Abingdon office at 276-525-1405 or my Christiansburg office at 540-381-5671. To reach my office via email, please visit my website at www.morgangriffith.house.gov.

On Thursday, Michigan reported 5,937 new cases of COVID-19 and 182 new deaths, bringing the Michigan’s total case count to 412,137 and deaths to 10,395. Michigan’s daily case average is 6,258 and daily deaths has risen to 123. Nearly 4,000 Michiganders were hospitalized with the virus as of yesterday, and over 107,000 nationwide. These numbers should be a stark reminder for all of us the kind of devastating impact this virus is having in Michigan and across the country.
Cases remain high, though Michigan health officials have expressed “cautious optimism” in some recent positive trends in reports. We need to keep listening to the experts and following the guidelines. Wearing a mask, keeping your physical distance, and washing your hands regularly, have been proven time and time again to be the most effective methods to slow the spread. We’ve all got to do this so we can crush this virus, get people back to work, and work on the economy.
Yesterday, the FDA Vaccine Advisory Panel, a group of experts that makes recommendations to the FDA, voted to recommend the agency grant emergency use authorization to Pfizer for their vaccine. The FDA must now formally approve emergency use, but that is expected to come quickly. Governor Whitmer plans to prioritize vaccinating vulnerable populations, like frontline workers and nursing home residents, first. Until you have been fully vaccinated, following COVID guidelines is the best way to slow the spread.
Jobless claims have spiked again in the US. Last week, another 853,000 Americans filed for first-time unemployment. A new COVID relief package is not optional, we have got to do it. I’m continuing to push all sides to get this done. A number of different paths forward have been proposed, including options with strong bipartisan support, but they are being blocked in the Senate by Leader McConnell. Americans are demanding relief, and we must deliver!
As Congressional leadership continue negotiations on COVID relief, the House continued its work for Americans.
Some of what we passed this week includes:
	•	National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) – This year, the NDAA includes a pay raise for servicemembers; requires members of federal law enforcement, Armed Forces, or the National Guard to visibly display their name and agency when responding to a civil disturbance; and works to rename military bases named after anyone who voluntarily served in the Confederacy.
	•	Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) – This year’s WRDA authorized critical infrastructure improvements to the Brandon Road Lock and Dam Project that will keep our water safe and protect our precious resources.
	•	Continuing Appropriations – The House passed a Continuing Resolution, which funds the government until December 18th to prevent a government shutdown. Negotiators on both sides of the Capitol are continuing to negotiate a long-term funding package. It is critical we do not allow the government to shutdown in the middle of a pandemic.
	•	Medical Marijuana Research Act – My legislation to remove barriers to marijuana medical research passed the House with bipartisan support. For too long, we have been prevented from understanding the physical and mental health impact of marijuana.
	•	Rosalynn Smith Carter Mental Health Resolution – Legislation I introduced with Rep. Buddy Carter of Georgia honoring the extensive work of former First Lady Rosalynn Smith Carter in mental health passed the House. We are all better for Mrs. Carter’s tireless work and her legacy.
Stay safe, Michigan! And, as always, wear a mask, keep your physical distance, and wash those hands!

5/17/21 11:32,The Huddle: A Congressional Update,"Friends, 

Not long ago marked my 100th day in Congress. From expediting passports to social security benefits and assistance with the Small Business Administration, a large part of our efforts are dedicated to serving you and your family on a wide variety of issues. 

Team Owens is proud of the work we have accomplished on your behalf, and we look forward to what the next 100 days will bring. It is the honor of a lifetime to serve the greatest state in the Nation and our beautiful Fourth District. 

For more information on our efforts in the House, services I can provide, or to share your thoughts with me, visit Owens.House.Gov. 

See what else I've been up to below!

Discouraging Critical Race Theory


I grew up attending segregated schools in the Jim Crow South during a time when people were treated differently based on the color of their skin. Critical Race Theory preserves this way of thinking and undermines civil rights, constitutionally guaranteed equal protection before the law, and U.S. institutions at large. This is the United States of America, and no one should ever be subjected to the discrimination that our laws so clearly prohibit.

In response to the Biden Administration's proposal to fund education programs informed by Critical Race Theory, I introduced a bill that would restrict the teaching of CRT within federal institutions and a resolution that highlights the dangers of teaching CRT in U.S. schools. Together, this paired legislation underlines the systemic racism and damaging philosophy within this prejudicial ideological tool.

National Police Week


There's no better time than National Police Week to chat with law enforcement officers in the Fourth District. We discussed challenges in the wake of COVID-19 and the most effective ways to prevent crime. I appreciate their perspectives and will work hard to keep Utah's protectors fully funded.


I was proud to join my colleagues at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial to honor the police officers who gave their lives protecting their communities. God bless Utah's law enforcement officials and their families. 

Advocating for Utah's Small Businesses


Small businesses are the backbone of our state's economy and are responsible for over 557,000 high-paying jobs. Last week, my office hosted a roundtable in West Jordan, where we heard from small business owners from across the Fourth District. Utah small businesses and entrepreneurs have powered through a tough year, weathered many storms, and overcome countless hurdles in the wake of COVID-19. Now, in a post-pandemic economy, businesses are seeing signs of hope and getting back to work.

For small business resources, visit Owens.House.Gov. 

Advocating for In-Person Learning


Utah educators put students first, followed science, and safely returned to the classroom with proper precautions. It's time for the rest of the nation to follow suit. The science is clear - the longer schools stay closed, the further children will fall behind, particularly those in disadvantaged groups. Yet, only 49% of school districts across the country are currently open for in-person instruction.

I sent a letter to Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona demanding more information on the involvement of the American Federation of Teachers in the development of school reopening guidelines. It is inexcusable to prioritize unions over students and politics over science.

Read more here. 

Showcasing Utah's Success in Education


I was proud to join our state's leaders to welcome First Lady Jill Biden for her first official trip to the Beehive State, where she visited a local school and vaccine site in Salt Lake City. Even during a challenging year, Utah students are resilient and have persevered to find success in the classroom and beyond.

Thanks to the work of local leaders, we're also seeing great success in vaccination efforts. All Utahns 12 and older are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. To schedule an appointment, visit coronavirus.utah.gov or vaccinefinder.org. 

Combatting Human Trafficking

I was proud to team up with Representative Virginia Foxx to request a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report on how the federal government can improve life-saving response efforts and preventative measures to combat human trafficking.

Congress recently acted in a bipartisan manner to combat this form of modern-day slavery, passing several laws that created programs aimed at fighting the trafficking of both children and adults. Before creating new duplicative programs that double down on previously failed practices, we want a holistic view of what is working, what is not, and where there may be gaps or overlap between programs.

Read the full letter here. 

Utah Association of Homebuilders


Ensuring that we can continue to provide quality homes that are affordable to families across the economic spectrum is critical, especially in a post-pandemic economy. Last week, I discussed this and more with the Utah Home Builders Association in West Jordan. At the federal level, we must help keep the housing market strong and supplies like lumber affordable as the nation recovers economically from COVID-19.

This Coming Year
 
 
This is a perfect time to reflect on where we have been over the year and look forward to our hopes and goals in the coming year. As we begin to put a tough year behind us, I wanted to take a moment to tell you about my priorities as I fight for our district in the new Congress starting in 2021.
 
As always, the safety and security of hard-working people in our community is my number one priority as your elected official. As we enter into 2021, the first order of business must be coming together to address the health and economic crisis we face as a country. In the latest stimulus deal we passed, we made a down payment on COVID-19 relief; I believe we must come back to the table immediately in January to address the scale of this

crisis and solve challenges we left unsolved in that bill. I will be fighting to provide hard-working people with direct cash payments of $2,000 per month until this crisis is over. As officials have begun distributing the vaccine in Ohio and across the country, I will also be working to ensure the vaccine distribution is run efficiently and effectively so everyone has access to it.
 
As you likely know, I sit on the House Appropriations Committee, which has allowed me to bring back hundreds of millions of dollars for our community over my tenure in Congress. Because of my seniority on the committee, this year I look forward to moving into the Vice-Chair position on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. This position will allow me to help support local defense-related projects in our district and bring more money back to the State of Ohio. 
 
I will also continue to serve as Chair of the House Manufacturing Caucus where I plan to prioritize manufacturing and innovation at the federal level. I look forward to introducing legislation to establish an office in the White House to shape manufacturing policies and to prepare our future workforce so they can learn the skills necessary to compete in forward-thinking industries. That will not only help Ohioans secure more good-paying jobs, but it will help our country lead in the economy of the future. 
 
Finally, I plan to work across the aisle to create an infrastructure bill. This basic investment in our country will make good on years of promises: repairing our crippled roads and bridges, clearing out blight in our communities, and expanding broadband so every American has access to affordable highspeed internet.
 
While I’m working on these priorities in Washington, it’s important to me that you know I’m serving you. My offices are a resource should you need help with Social Security benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans benefits, visas, tax refunds, and more, my staff is a phone call away to answer your questions and help you out. Additionally, I am always interested in hearing what my constituents think of the serious issues we face as a country. Should you have questions, comments, or concerns about the work we are doing in Washington, please don’t hesitate to call by phone or submit the written form on my website.
 
Serving our community is the honor of my lifetime. I look forward to a successful and prosperous coming year for Northeast Ohio.
 
Best,

Tim

THE FIGHT TO END TOXIC DISCHARGES

Lindsey - 
This week the Army Corps of Engineers announced plans to temporarily pause discharges from Lake Okeechobee to the St. Lucie with plans to resume them after a 5-day period at a rate of 1,500 cubic feet per second. In other words, they still plan to dump 969 million gallons per day into our estuary. 
The truth is that this is simply unnecessary, which is exactly what I told Colonel Kelly of the Army Corps this week. I made it clear that I will keep fighting for real operational change to end this abuse of our community, and I’m not going to stop until we succeed. 
To that end, as you may know, I wrote and passed legislation to mandate the Army Corps fix their Lake Okeechobee Regulation Schedule, which determines when discharges happen. The Army Corps is currently doing the analysis required by that law, and I am continuing to advocate for a regulation schedule that stops toxic discharges. 
We know that real operational change is the only way we will be able to stop these discharges! Check out this week’s Week In Review video to learn more: 
WATCH NOW 
In case you missed it, here are a few other things that happened this week: 
	•	I helped introduce the bipartisan CATS Act to end cruel, abusive tests on cats and kittens at the Department of Veterans Affairs.
	•	I was named co-chair of the Air Cargo Caucus, which will play a critical role in the safe and efficient distribution of the coronavirus vaccine.
	•	The House of Representatives passed a bill to improve monitoring and forecasting of harmful algal blooms and hypoxia in Florida!

12/31/20 8:03,Senator King's Monthly e-Newsletter: December 2020 Recap,"Senate Passes Bipartisan Pandemic Relief Legislation

Unveiling the bipartisan framework for the COVID-19 Emergency Relief Package 
On December 21st, Congress passed a $900 billion coronavirus relief package – answering a critical call for badly-needed aid from the American people. After extensive bipartisan efforts and negotiation, Congress reached an agreement to help citizens in need weather the cold, dark winter ahead. This legislation includes:
	•	Critical unemployment funds to help Americans who’ve lost work through no fault of their own, along with an economic impact payment to help families make ends meet; 
	•	Additional support for small businesses who’ve been hit hard by the economic slowdown; 
	•	Vital investments in the public health infrastructure that will be essential to controlling and defeating this pandemic, including the distribution of the coronavirus vaccine; 
	•	Increased funding to help families struggling to make rent catch up on overdue payments;
	•	Support for emergency broadband service for low-income families;    and an increase to SNAP benefits so families facing hard times can keep food on the table.
President Trump signed the bill into law on December 27th, after an unnecessary delay.  Though this bill will do a lot of good, for a lot of people, it is not enough for us to fully overcome the health and economic challenges our nation faces when this bill expires. There is more work to do – for families, for businesses, and for state and local governments who have led the response to this crisis at the local level. It is my hope that this legislation will provide a bridge to the spring, and that in the months ahead my House and Senate colleagues will continue to collaborate in a bipartisan spirit to craft another package that will provide additional support to people in need.

Read more about the key provisions that are included in this legislation HERE. 
In this legislation Congress approved new $600 economic impact payments (EIP) for adults making $75,000 a year or less and married couples making $150,000 a year or less, plus $600 per child dependent. For the most up to date information on eligibility, when the payments will be issued, how to be sure the IRS has your information, or other questions about this new round of EIPs, please visit the Internal Revenue Service’s information page HERE. 

Year-End Appropriations Bill Passes Senate with Initiatives to Support Maine Jobs, Bolster National Defense
The COVID relief bill was one piece of a larger piece of legislation called the Combined Appropriations Act, which also funded federal government operations and priorities through September of 2021.  This year-end legislation includes a wide range of provisions that will improve life for Maine people. The bill includes provisions to support good, high-paying jobs and will help working Maine families afford essential needs, including housing and child care.   Additionally, the legislation will take important steps to enhance our national security by funding shipbuilding priorities and reestablishing America’s leadership in global public health. The coming year will continue to present challenges as our nation grapples with the impacts of the coronavirus, and this legislation will help our nation confront these difficulties. I’m grateful to see this bipartisan product pass into law, and I am eager to continue working across the aisle with my colleagues in the coming year.
Here are a few highlights of what’s included: 
	•	Working to prevent future catastrophic pandemics. The legislation provides substantially increased funding for US global health security activities – one of my key priorities. My Global Health Security Act was the first Senate legislation to address the vital challenge of emerging infectious diseases. The bill provides a $193 million to support CDC’s efforts to strengthen the capacities of developing countries to prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease threats and outbreaks; this figure represents an increase of $20 million. The bill also increases USAID global health security funding by $90 million, to a total of $190 million, to strengthen the ability of target countries to prevent, detect, and respond to future zoonotic viruses and other infectious diseases, and to identify unknown zoonotic viruses.
	•	Funding shipbuilding priorities. The legislation appropriates $3.2 billion for the procurement of DDG-51 Arleigh Burke-class destroyers in fiscal year 2021, which Bath Iron Works (BIW) can compete to build. It also authorizes $159.3 million to fund future year DDG-51 procurements. In addition, the legislation authorizes funds $78.2 million for the completion of the DDG-1000 Zumwalt-class destroyers, all of which are being built at BIW.
	•	Providing military personnel with high-quality, Maine-made equipment. The legislation appropriates $1.1 billion in funding for CH-53K heavy lift helicopters, which include components produced at Hunting Dearborn in Fryeburg. The legislation also includes $201.2 million for advance procurement of these helicopters.
	•	Expanding telehealth for veterans. The agreement provides $1.3 billion to sustain and increase telehealth capacity for veterans, including in rural and highly rural areas. This effort builds on work done during the coronavirus pandemic to improve access to care for veterans, and would help older veterans and those who live in rural areas stay connected to healthcare providers.
Futher information about the 2021 omnibus appropriations bill can be found HERE. 
  

December Legislative Highlights 

In addition to the passage of the $900 billion coronavirus relief package and the congressional budget, here are a few key legislative pushes that succeeded this month: 
	•	Advocating for Maine veterans’ health services. Following unanimous passage by the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, the State Veterans Homes Domiciliary Care Flexibility Act – my legislation with Senators Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) was sent to the President to be signed into law.  Read more HERE.
	•	Encouraging folks to stay home during the holiday season. As coronavirus cases continue to skyrocket nationwide, I wrote to leaders of six major streaming services, requesting that the companies make content available free of charge to encourage Americans to stay home and slow the spread of the coronavirus during the holiday season. Read more HERE.
	•	Pushing for vaccine distribution equity. I joined a group of colleagues to urge Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Robert Redfield to ensure a fair and equitable vaccine distribution for minority and high-risk populations disproportionately impacted by the virus. Read more HERE.
	•	Strengthening the local agricultural economy. Senator Collins and I sponsored the Strengthening Local Processing Act, bipartisan legislation that would provide much-needed federal support to America’s small meat and poultry processors and help strengthen and streamline their operations. Read more HERE.
  

Connecting with Maine People through the Pandemic 
 
Members of the Maine State Chamber of Commerce 
Even as the pandemic changes the way we interact, I’ve made it a priority to engage with Maine people from all walks of life and helpful organizations to address questions surrounding the coronavirus pandemic and identify remaining work to be done. In May, I held a tele-town hall, inviting all Maine people to call in toll-free, to listen and respond to questions about coronavirus response efforts. Since the Senate passed the CARES Act, I’ve participated in teleconferences and phone calls with:
	•	Maine healthcare providers and advocates, such as the Maine Dental Association and Protect our Care.
	•	Maine students and educators, including the 16 Maine 2020 County Teachers of the Year, Maine Jump$tart Coalition’s two Finance Educators of the Year, school psychologists, MLTI Virtual Student Conference, University of Maine System Student Veterans, and civics and history teachers from schools across Maine.
	•	Maine business and community leaders leaders, including members of the Houlton Rotary Club, Maine Arts Commission, Maine State Chamber of Commerce, Maine Coast Fishermen’s Association, Penobscot Bay Regional Chamber of Commerce, the New England Council, 120 of Portland’s small business owners and 500 Maine employees of Sun Life.
	•	Maine nonprofits including the Maine Association of Nonprofits (MANP), United Way and YMCA Youth Advocates from Maine.
	•	Maine seniors in a call hosted by AARP Maine.
	•	Maine democracy-focused organizations, such as the Maine League of Women Voters.
  

Happy Holidays, from the Capitol! 

The U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree
It’s unfortunately not the best year for holiday travel, so I thought I’d bring the U.S. Capitol Christmas tree to your inboxes. Each year, a different national forest is chosen to provide a Christmas tree for display on the West Lawn of the Capitol, and our tree this year came from the Grand Mesa, Uncompahgre and Gunnison National Forests in Colorado. 

As breathtaking as the Capitol Christmas tree was this month, I thoroughly enjoyed spending Christmas at home in Brunswick with my family and our much smaller tree – complete with its own facemask! Even amidst all the challenges facing our nation, there’s nothing that can beat a Maine Christmas; I hope that all of you enjoyed a safe and peaceful holiday.

Important Vaccine Update
On Tuesday, SC Governor Henry McMaster announced that South Carolinians aged 65 and older will be able to schedule appointments for the COVID-19 vaccine beginning Monday, February 8th. (Previously, the age group was 70 and older.)  SC DHEC has a website to help locate vaccine providers in our state.  Additionally, it has established a care line to call for questions about the COVID-19 vaccines or to help find a provider. That phone number is toll free: (866) 365-8110.  Important: Appointments to receive the COVID-19 vaccine cannot be made on the SC DHEC website or by calling the SC DHEC phone number listed above.  These two SC DHEC resources will only help locate providers near you that may be offering the vaccine. You then will need to take additional steps to create an appointment, depending on that provider's policies.  On a related note, my office has received a significant number of calls about the availability and distribution policies of the COVID-19 vaccine, particularly the requirement of most providers that you must register online with an email address just to make an appointment. I am extremely concerned for those in our state who do not have easy access to the internet and who are finding it very difficult to locate a provider that will accept appointments over the phone.   State and local officials have advised if you know someone who may need assistance creating an email address and scheduling a vaccine appointment online, that you please considering reaching out to offer them help.

Watch My Recent Forum on Vaccines
I recently hosted a very informative radio forum on the COVID-19 vaccines, which included an expert from SC DHEC as well as a medical doctor who specializes in infectious diseases. You can find a replay of this program, along with a list of each question that was asked, on my website or Facebook page.

Supporting Term Limits
I believe term limits should apply to every single person serving in Congress, including me. That’s why I’ve proposed an amendment to our Constitution that would limit the number of terms someone could serve in the House or Senate.

Efforts to Save Parris Island
Parris Island has significant importance to South Carolina, our military, and our nation. For over 100 years, it has been the preeminent training base for U.S. Marine Corps recruits. With recent news about a possible closure, I've co-sponsored legislation in the House to prevent this from happening.

My Pro-Life Legislation
Even though the 117th Congress officially began just a few weeks ago, I've already sponsored or co-sponsored more than 60 bills in the House of Representatives. Last month, I placed a heavy emphasis on pro-life legislation, signing my name to over 20 bills to protect the lives of unborn children.

2/8/21 15:02,Mario's Message,"February 8, 2021
Dear friend,

Welcome back to another edition of Mario’s Message. As the 117th Congress kicks off, I want to continue to ensure that my constituents are kept up to date on all things happening in Washington and Florida’s 25th Congressional District. It is my absolute honor to serve you, and I encourage you to get in touch with my office if we can ever be of assistance. 


COVID-19 Vaccine Information 

Governor Ron DeSantis has signed Executive Order 20-315, which outlines that providers can only administer the COVID-19 shot to the following groups: 
	1.	Long-term care facility residents and staff
	2.	Healthcare workers in direct contact with COVID-19 patients, including paramedics and EMS
	3.	People age 65 and older

Visit my website for the most up-to-date information about the COVID-19 vaccine distribution in our community. 
COVID-19 Resources

As of February 7, 2021, there have been 2,661,796 COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in Florida with a total of 1,993,966 people vaccinated. 




Luke and Alex School Safety Bill

As we approach the third anniversary of the Parkland shooting, one thing remains at the forefront of my priorities: doing all that I can to promote, enhance, and increase school safety. As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, I have secured billions in federal dollars to fund school safety initiatives, including school hardening measures, youth mental health services, and training for staff and law enforcement officers. Just last week, I had the privilege to re-introduce the Luke and Alex School Safety bill, which creates an all-inclusive site for schools, families, and community officials to obtain valuable information on school safety resources and best practices. I reiterate my gratitude to the Parkland families, including Alex's father, Max Schachter, Luke's parents, Gena and Tom Hoyer, and Gina’s father, Tony Montalto, who is the President of Stand with Parkland. They have truly turned their grief into advocacy for the safety of our children, and I cannot thank them enough for their efforts in making our schools more secure. 


Reappointed to Three Appropriations Subcommittees


I'm beyond thrilled to have been reappointed to serve on the Defense, and State and Foreign Operations Subcommittees on Appropriations, in addition to serving as Ranking Member of the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Subcommittee. Now, more than ever, we must ensure that the United States is equipped with the best-trained, most capable military that will continue promoting and protecting our national security interests both at home and abroad. We must also redouble our efforts to demand human rights around the world, continue to fight against the vicious cancer that is the dictatorships in Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, and support our key friend and ally, Israel. I look forward to serving my constituents on these important subcommittees. 


BOLIVAR Act

I'm proud to have joined my colleague, Rep. Michael Waltz in introducing the BOLIVAR Act to Ban Contracting with the Maduro Regime. We must continue to support the Venezuelan people by denying resources to their oppressors, oppressors who have engaged in narco-trafficking, corrupted Venezuela’s once democratic institutions, and perpetrated egregious human rights abuses including torture, imprisonment of political opponents, and murder. I strongly support this bipartisan effort to ensure that U.S. dollars are not used to sustain the anti-American, murderous regime in Venezuela. I commend Rep. Waltz for building on his legislation from the previous Congress to protect U.S. national security interests by prohibiting U.S. contracts that enrich the Maduro dictatorship.

5/3/21 16:41,The DeSaulnier Digest: 100 Days of Delivering for the American People,"Dear Lindsey: 
Last week, President Biden addressed the nation during a joint session of Congress to discuss the progress made in his first 100 days in office to combat the pandemic and rebuild toward a more just and inclusive economy and his plan for the future. As the President laid out his plan, I was honored to be joined by the Director of Contra Costa Health Services, Anna Roth. Anna has led the remarkably successful effort to vaccinate our County and her leadership has helped to establish Contra Costa as a model for our state and country in the fight to combat the virus and protect our residents. In advance of the President's address, I sat down with Anna to discuss vaccination successes, increasing equity in our health system, and the need to strengthen support for our health care infrastructure. You can tune in to the conversation by clicking here or on the image below.

WASHINGTON UPDATE
President Biden Unveils American Families Plan During Address to the Nation 
In President Biden's address to the nation, he unveiled the American Families Plan, a $1.8 trillion plan that would expand access to education, reduce the cost of child care, and support women in the workforce. Specifically, the plan includes financing for universal prekindergarten, a federal paid leave program, efforts to make child care more affordable, free community college for all, aid for students at colleges that historically serve nonwhite communities, expanded subsidies under the Affordable Care Act, and an extension of new federal efforts to fight poverty. Congressman DeSaulnier supports the American Families Plan because investing in our education system and our families is the single-most important investment a nation can make to ensure a bright future for all. 
TOWN HALL RECAPS
Congressman DeSaulnier was joined by public health experts to discuss how the pandemic has disproportionately affected communities of color and to answer frequently asked questions about vaccines, testing, and more. If you missed it, click here or on the image below for the full conversation.  
 
After hearing from many of you with questions about filing taxes as we approach the extended May deadline and as another round of Economic Impact Payments has been made available thanks to the American Rescue Plan, Congressman DeSaulnier hosted a town hall with California's IRS Congressional District Liaison to answer your questions.

12/23/20 9:30,Delivering for WV,"Dear West Virginian,   Ahead of the Christmas holiday, Congress accomplished a lot. Finally, after months of delay, Democrats have compromised on a coronavirus relief deal. On Tuesday evening, we passed this targeted COVID relief, which was included in the omnibus appropriations act. I’m relieved we could finally deliver much-needed aid to thousands of Americans struggling as a result of the pandemic.  While this is great news, this should have been done sooner. Many of the provisions in this legislation were already included in the HEALS Act, which is a targeted COVID relief bill that Senate Republicans offered up this summer. Speaker Nancy Pelosi herself admitted to holding out on this relief because she thought it would be beneficial politically. Countless small businesses shuttered their doors in the meantime while Speaker Pelosi played political games. This is unacceptable and Congress must do better. I spoke about this on the Senate floor on Monday night. Click here or the image below to watch.     Here are a few highlights of the bill: 
	•	Direct payments of $600 for individuals making up to $75,000 per year and $1,200 for couples making up to $150,000 per year, plus an additional $600 per child.  
	•	Enhanced unemployment benefits of $300 per week for 11 weeks.  
	•	$319 billion for small businesses, including $284 billion through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), $20 billion for EIDL loans, and $15 billion for live venues.  
	•	$25 billion in rental assistance with an extension of the eviction moratorium.  
	•	$82 billion for schools and universities, with $10 billion dedicated to childcare.  
	•	$7 billion for increased access to broadband.  
	•	Funding to support coronavirus vaccine distribution.  
	•	CARES Act spending extension for state and local governments.
Wild and Wonderful and Ready to Share!    After years of hard work and persistence, West Virginia’s New River Gorge is finally being recognized as one of our country’s most beautiful places with its new designation as a National Park and Preserve. I was thrilled that my legislation redesignating the National River as a National Park and Preserve was included in the year-end legislative package and it is now official with the recent passage on Tuesday. 
   This is such exciting news for our state of West Virginia and the entire nation! The New River Gorge will be established as the 63rd National Park and the 20th National Preserve within the National Park Service.  As West Virginians, we all know that the New River Gorge is perhaps the best-known landmark in West Virginia because of its breathtaking natural beauty and elements of unique Appalachian history and culture. Now, we will have the opportunity to share this with the rest of the nation—and world—with our own National Park right here in our backyard. Click here for more on what this means for West Virginia.  Funding the Government   Congress also fulfilled its duty to fund the government (although months behind schedule) by passing the Fiscal Year 2021 appropriations omnibus. As a leader on the Appropriations Committee, I worked hard to make sure West Virginia priorities were included in this year-end package. However, I’m frustrated by the political games and gridlock that have prevented us from passing these bills on time. We must take the politicization out the appropriations process. Funding the government is one of Congress’ most fundamental jobs, and we must do better.  West Virginia wins included in the year-end omnibus package include: 
	•	A $300 million increase was included for Alzheimer’s research through the National Institutes of Health (NIH), along with an additional increase for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) through the BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer’s Act, and language diversifying the depth and focuses of research.  
	•	Full funding for the Office of Fossil Energy Research, supporting clean and efficient energy creation at the National Energy Technology Lab (NETL) in Morgantown through their engineering and supercomputing efforts. Furthermore, within the office, $15 million is included for research of commercial-scale front-end carbon capture technologies, which I championed with bipartisan support in the Senate. Language is also included to address maintenance backlog and prevention.    
	•	$635 million for the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Rural Development Broadband ReConnect program, which I helped create and has now secured over $2 billion for the program over the past four budget cycles.  
	•	Continued funding for the extremely competitive Better Utilizing Investments to Leverage Development (BUILD) Grants through the U.S. Department of Transportation, which West Virginia has received $80 million through since 2018.   
	•	$346 million for the Economic Development Administration (EDA), an inactive program in West Virginia up until I was elected to the Senate that now continues to invest in the state.  
	•	$180 million was included for the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC), a constant driver of economic and infrastructure development in the region, and $100 million for the Appalachian Highway Development System (ADHS). I pushed for dedicated funding for incomplete corridors in FY20 and the amount has been maintained.  
	•	Support for the Leetown Science Center in Kearneysville and the National Conservation Training Center in Shepherdstown, along with continued funding for the Allegany Ballistics Lab at Rocket Center and the Biometric Technology Center in Clarksburg. The legislation also supports the men and woman of the FBI at the Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division in Clarksburg, NASA’s Katherine Johnson IV&I Facility, and the National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration (NOAA) National Environmental Security Computing Center in Fairmont.  
	•	A three percent pay raise for our service members, language instructing the study of security infrastructure at U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical facilities, and continued support for the veteran’s Agritherapy pilot program Senator Capito created that is implemented at the Huntington VA, are also all included.  
	•	Increases are included for university research programs, diversifying educational opportunities for students and faculty across the state.   
	•	Funding and language I authored is maintained for the State Opioid Response (SOR) grants, enabling West Virginia to receiveover $100 million since the establishment of the program in 2018.  
	•	Authorized under the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), funding is included for both the Sexual Assault Services Program and the Sexual Assault Kit Initiative.   
New Capito Connect Bill 
   Remote learning is hard enough on our kids, but when you don’t have reliable broadband access, it’s even worse. Across the country, countless students are forced to do their school work in parking lots, restaurants, and libraries. That’s why I introduced the Every Child Connected Act, legislation that aims to reduce the digital divide between students with and without internet access, known as the Homework Gap. Learn more about how this bill redirects funding to help children learning from home: https://bit.ly/38ptqkq   Additional COVID-19 Resources  I created a page on my website with information and resources to keep you up-to-date on the coronavirus situation as it continues to evolve. Check out that page here, and please share with friends so they can keep up with the latest.  In addition to my webpage, I also want to make sure you know where to get the latest updates from the medical experts at CDC.gov and West Virginia DHHR.      I will continue doing my best to keep you up to speed on what we are doing here at the federal level to help and other resources that can be useful back at home. I will be posting regular updates on my Facebook and Twitter accounts, so be sure to follow me there.  Important Information If You’re Visiting DC  Because of coronavirus concerns, all Capitol and White House tours have been suspended indefinitely. Please contact our Washington office to reschedule. Additionally, requests for flags flown over the Capitol may be delayed, and access to the Capitol and House and Senate office buildings is being restricted. Feel free to contact our office at (202) 224-6472 with any questions. We apologize for any inconvenience.  How Can We Help?  Whether you need help with a casework issue or have a question about scheduling a meeting at one of my offices, my staff and I are ready to assist you. Learn more about the services we offer at www.capito.senate.gov.  You can also submit your feedback and share your stories with me by visiting my “Share Your Stories” webpage here: www.capito.senate.gov/ShareYourStories.  Social Media Recap 
 
  
  
 
 
From my family to yours, Merry Christmas! As crazy as this past year has been, we will get through this together. With the distribution of the coronavirus vaccine occurring now, I’m hopeful for a better 2021.   Join me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram for regular updates and photos.

May 5, 2021
 
Friend,
 
I want to provide you with an update on issues that we are discussing in Congress.
 
In April, President Biden and Vice President Harris stood in the Rose Garden and told one falsehood after another to the American people in order to advance their gun control agenda. I accepted an invitation to appear on One America News Network to expose the many lies that the Biden administration is telling. I've included a video of my appearance for your review.
 
The month also featured the first meeting of the Second Amendment Caucus, which I co-chair with Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado. We received a presentation from representatives of the DC Project, a nonpartisan initiative to reveal the real face of American gun owners: daughters, mothers, and sisters. They have asked us to oppose the nomination of David Chipman to be the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), which I have done.
 
Speaking of the Second Amendment, I have also introduced legislation that
allows voting-age adults to purchase handguns. My legislation, known as the SAFER Voter Act, repeals the federal law that prevents adults aged 18 to 20 from purchasing handguns from Federal Firearm License (FFL) holders. More details are below. 
 
In April, I revealed that the vaccine fact-checkers at FactCheck.org are funded by an organization that holds over $1.8 billion of stock in a vaccine company. In addition, their organization is run by a former Director of the Centers for Disease Control. Daniel Horowitz has written an important article about this matter that I am pleased to share.
 
On a related subject, I have cosponsored legislation that seeks to fire Dr. Fauci.  I appeared as Kennedy's guest on the Fox Business Network to discuss the bill. I have included a video of my appearance below.
 
Finally, House Democrats have falsely impugned former President Trump and Republicans as ""racist"" and ""xenophobic"" for supporting temporary travel bans against seven specific countries. Their hypocrisy is staggering. On the House floor, I reminded them that they voted to restrict travel from these same seven countries when President Obama asked them to do so in 2015.

Massie Exposes Gun-Control Lies Told by Biden-Harris
 
I recently appeared on OAN’s ""Real America with Dan Ball"" to expose the false claims Biden and Harris are spreading to further their gun control agenda.
 
They are misrepresenting background check data, falsely claiming that gun manufacturers can't be sued, and lying about the prevalence of so-called ""ghost guns"" in crimes. We cannot allow these lies to go unchecked. I am grateful for the opportunity to fact-check them.
 
By the way, have you noticed that Democrats use the term ""gun safety"" instead of ""gun control""? They don't want to say ""gun control"" because they know that phrase could cost them in the next election.
 
 

  
Second Amendment Caucus co-chairs, Thomas Massie and Lauren Boebert, host a presentation from the DC Project. 
 
Massie, Boebert Host Second Amendment Caucus Meeting
 
I am co-chair of the Second Amendment Caucus with Congresswoman Lauren Boebert. We recently hosted our first caucus meeting together, joined by members of the DC Project.
 
One of the top items on the DC Project's agenda is to organize opposition to the Senate confirmation of David Chipman to be the Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). I joined 8 of my House colleagues in expressing our opposition to Mr. Chipman's nomination in a letter to Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin and Ranking Member Chuck Grassley. 
 
The DC Project's representatives presented a compelling look at their legislative agenda for this session of Congress. Not only did they identify legislation that poses a threat to our Second Amendment rights, but they also identified initiatives in Congress that present opportunities to further protect our right to keep and bear arms. I appreciate the educational work they do, and, on behalf of the Second Amendment Caucus, I extend our thanks for their efforts.
 
Massie Introduces the SAFER Voter Act 
 
I have introduced the ""Second Amendment For Every Registrable Voter Act"" (SAFER Voter Act). The SAFER Voter Act would repeal the federal law that prevents voting-age adults, ages 18 to 20, from purchasing a handgun from a Federal Firearms License (FFL) holder.
 
Why should a 20-year-old single mom be denied the right to defend herself and her children? 18, 19, and 20-year-olds are considered adults and can vote on important public policy issues. They can also form business contracts, get married, and serve in the military. As adults, these Americans should not be deprived of basic constitutional rights.
 
The SAFER Voter Act's original co-sponsors include Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), Rep. Alex Mooney (R-WV), Rep. Jody Hice (R-GA), Rep. Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA), Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-GA), Rep. Scott DesJarlais (R-TN), Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC), and Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL). 
 
Companion legislation has been introduced in the United States Senate by Senator Cynthia Lummis (R-WY). The legislation has also been endorsed by the Gun Owners of America (GOA) and the National Association for Gun Rights (NAGR).
 
 

  
Massie Reveals Vaccine Fact-Checker's Financial Ties to Vaccine Company
 
Revealed: Vaccine Fact-checker, FactCheck.org, is Funded by a Foundation Holding $1.8 billion in Johnson & Johnson Stock
 
On my Twitter account, @RepThomasMassie, I have been exposing the connections that vaccine fact-checker ""FactCheck.org"" has to a vaccine company, Johnson & Johnson (J&J). Did you know that funding for their work comes from the Robert Woods Johnson (RWJ) foundation? This is particularly notable because the RWJ Foundation holds over $1.8 billion worth of J&J stock. 
 
David Horowitz of TheBlaze.com has written an important article about the financial connections I have uncovered. The article is entitled ""Facebook’s ‘independent’ fact-checker on vaccines is funded by … you guessed it."" It is linked here. I encourage you to read the whole thing. 
 
Several of my loved ones have taken a COVID vaccine and I support their decisions. However, I have decided not to take the vaccine myself based on the fact that I’ve already tested positive for the antibodies due to prior exposure to the virus. For everyone, this needs to be a personal decision based on the best available information. People should not be deceived or coerced. That’s why I’m so passionate about exposing misinformation and conflicts of interest when I find them.
 
 
 

 
 
Massie Discusses ""Fire Fauci Act"" on Fox Business Network
 
In case you missed it, I was Kennedy's guest on her Fox Business show. We discussed the ""Fire Fauci Act"", reaching herd immunity, and the absurdity of the mask theater playing out in Washington, D.C.
 
Members of Congress fly back to Washington, D.C. on airplanes, sitting maybe six inches apart, not six feet apart. Then, when they get to Washington, they engage in all of this political theater. It's just ridiculous. We need to get back to normal, not a ""new normal.""
 
 
 

 
 
Massie Gives Hypocritical House Democrats a History Lesson
 
House Democrats are falsely impugning President Trump and Republicans as ""racist"" and ""xenophobic"" for supporting temporary travel bans against seven specific countries. I reminded hypocritical House Democrats that they voted for travel restrictions against these same seven countries when Obama was President.
 
The ""Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015,"" signed by Obama, prevented four countries from getting expedited travel visas- Iraq, Syria, Iran, and Sudan. President Obama later added three more countries to this list- Libya, Somalia, and Yemen. The seven countries referenced above are the same seven countries Democrats single out now to insist support for travel restrictions are ""racist"" or ""xenophobic.""
 
Was it ""racist"" or ""xenophobic"" when Obama eliminated visa waivers for these same counties? No. I won't accuse anybody of that. That's what our colleagues on the other side of the aisle do. Everyone who voted for that legislation in 2015 was voting in the United States of America's best interests.
 
In Liberty,

Dear Friend, 

Early last Wednesday, I was diagnosed by the House Physician with COVID-19, and was told that I must immediately quarantine. As such, I was not present for the debate and the vote on the Floor regarding the certification of electoral votes.

Obviously the events of last week were very troubling. Let me first say in unequivocal terms that violence is never justified. I have strongly condemned it when it occurred on the left, and with equal vigor, I condemn what took place last week. While I support the Constitutionally-protected right to a peaceful protest, the lawless images we saw of people ignoring law enforcement directives, battling with authorities and vandalizing public property were a stain on our democracy. As we work to ensure accountability for all those who committed these criminal acts and investigate the planning failures that allowed such an incident to occur, I remain grateful to all the brave men and women who serve in the Capitol Police Department. My thoughts and prayers are especially with the family and friends of U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died as a result of injuries sustained during the attack. May his service and sacrifice never be forgotten and may his memory be eternal! 

The time has now come to move forward and act upon the lessons that we have learned from this experience. The entire 2020 election has shed light on the fact that many states in our union need to review and improve their election laws in order to restore greater confidence in the integrity of our process. Because of these concerns, I joined my colleagues in signing on to the amicus brief asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of the changes that were made to election processes in several states. Transparency is key. I was a Member of the Florida Legislature during the 2000 Presidential election which was also wrought with problems. We did important work after that election to modernize and strengthen our elections’ procedures. Florida should serve as a model for other states moving forward, and I am exploring legislative remedies for achieving this paramount goal. 

Regardless of how we feel about the 2020 election or which candidate we supported, the long-term success of our country is dependent on our willingness to work together for the greater good. We have serious problems that require the attention of thoughtful, principled, solution-oriented leaders. I remain committed to working in such a manner as we prepare for a peaceful transition of power later this month. I especially look forward to working with my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee on stopping the overreach of Big Tech in silencing the viewpoints of all Americans. All of my constituents can be assured that I will continue to defend conservative principles and work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle as we seek free-market solutions to restore our way of life, rebuild our economy and renew the American dream.

Please continue reading for a brief overview of important public information.  

Ensuring the Rule of Law

I am glad to see the state of Florida taking action to crack down on violent protests and protect funding for law enforcement. Violence, especially against our first responders, must never be tolerated.  Anyone who engages in this type of activity must be held accountable. The rule of law must prevail!  
 
 

Providing Relief to Small Businesses

I know many local small businesses are in desperate need of relief. The Small Business Administration has extended the deadline to apply for an Economic Injury Disaster Loan. Click here to learn more. 

Here is also some updated information about the second round of Paycheck Program Protection loans for small businesses. As a reminder, business owners apply for this assistance directly through his/her lender. 
 

Protecting Consumers

Last week, the Combating Pandemic Scams Act, which I co-sponsored, was signed into law. The bill requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), in consultation with relevant agencies, to inform the public about mail, telemarketing, and internet scams related to COVID-19. Additionally, the FTC must establish a national database of this information and also provide information on how to report COVID-19-related scams to the appropriate agency. Especially during times of crisis, we must protect vulnerable populations from exploitation.

According to the Pasco County Health Department, someone created a FAKE Eventbrite account and has been charging seniors to register for the COVID-19 vaccination. This despicable, criminal act is an awful example of exploiting the elderly and must not be tolerated. I trust law enforcement is working to apprehend those responsible and hold them accountable for their egregious offense. I am aware that many people in Pasco are having difficulty obtaining a vaccine slot due to the limited available supply, and I’ve relayed these concerns to state and local leaders. However, as of right now, the Pasco County Health Department has confirmed that the only way to register is by visiting this website and clicking on the link that says Vaccine Distribution. If you are on the correct site, you will not be charged to sign up for the vaccine, as it is free of charge.  
 

Offering Direct Relief to Americans Impacted by the Pandemic 

I’ve received many questions about the newly extended unemployment benefits for those who remain unemployed due to the pandemic. The state recently shared the following guidelines for accessing these benefits. 

	•	The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity has now provided additional weeks for nearly one million claimants who have not previously exhausted their federal benefits before December 26, 2020. These individuals should receive notification through their CONNECT account regarding benefits for those additional weeks. 
	•	Claimants who exhausted their eligible weeks of benefits under the CARES act and are unemployed after December 27, 2020 will be able to request benefit payments soon. 
	•	The Governor has waived the waiting week requirement and work search/work registration requirements through February 27, 2021.
	•	For more information, please visit the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity’s website. 
 
 

The IRS has also announced that it has finished processing the second round of Economic Impact Payments. Below, it has provided answers to frequently asked questions. Additionally, the IRS is encouraging Americans to visit the Get my Payment Tool to receive the most up-to-date information about their payment. 

	•	I didn’t receive a direct deposit yet. Will I get a second Economic Impact Payment? 

Maybe. IRS updated Get My Payment (GMP) for individuals who are receiving the second Economic Impact Payment on January 5, 2021. If you checked GMP on or after January 5 then: 

	•	If GMP reflects a direct deposit date and partial account information, then your payment is deposited there. 
	•	If GMP reflects a date your payment was mailed, it may take up to 3 – 4 weeks for you to receive the payment. Watch your mail carefully for a check or debit card. (See the FAQ for EIP Card) 
	•	If GMP shows “Payment Status #2 – Not Available,” then you will not receive a second Economic Impact Payment and instead you need to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit on your 2020 Tax Return. 

Because of the speed at which the law required the IRS to issue the second round of Economic Impact Payments, some payments may have been sent to an account that may be closed or, is or no longer active, or unfamiliar. By law, the financial institution must return the payment to the IRS; they cannot hold and issue the payment to an individual when the account is no longer active. If Get My Payment shows “Payment Status #2 – Not Available” you will not receive a second EIP.  The IRS advises people that if they don’t receive their Economic Impact Payment, they should file their 2020 tax return electronically and claim the Recovery Rebate Credit on their tax return to get their payment and any refund as quickly as possible. 

	•	What if I have a different bank account than I had on my 2019 tax return. What should I do? 

If the second Economic Impact Payment was sent to an account that is closed or is no longer active the financial institution must, by law, return the payment to the IRS, they cannot hold and issue the payment to an individual when the account is no longer active. The IRS advises people that if they don’t receive the full Economic Impact Payment they should file their 2020 tax return electronically and claim the Recovery Rebate Credit on their tax return to get their payment and any refund as quickly as possible. 

	•	Why can’t the IRS re-issue the second Economic Impact Payment to me? 

The IRS is working hard to deliver the second Economic Impact Payment quickly, as required by law, while still preparing for the upcoming 2021 tax filing season. Due to the compressed timeline, the IRS is unable to reissue and mail checks and instead encourages people to file their 2020 tax return electronically to claim and receive the Recovery Rebate Credit quickly as possible.

	•	Can I call the IRS, software company or bank to resolve issues with my Economic Impact Payment?

People should visit IRS.gov for the most current information on the second round of Economic Impact Payments rather than calling the agency or their financial institutions or tax software providers. IRS phone assistors do not have additional information beyond what’s available on IRS.gov. 

 

Ensuring Access to a Safe and Effective Covid-19 Vaccine

This column by HHS Secretary Alex Azar outlines the steps the federal government is taking to improve the vaccine distribution process and ensure that the vaccine is able to efficiently inoculate as many Americans as possible. 

Many seniors in Pasco, Pinellas and Hillsborough counties have reported difficulties registering for a vaccine. I have shared your feedback with state and local officials, and have been assured they are working on improvements. As they work to strengthen this process, I will ensure they have continued federal support. In the interim, you can sign-up for text messages to get the most updated vaccine information available. 
 

Celebrating Epiphany
 
﻿While last week’s Epiphany celebration in Tarpon Springs was limited to parishioners due to safety concerns, I hope all of my Orthodox brothers and sisters enjoyed the sacred celebration. May the joy and hope that accompanies this holy day stay with each of you throughout the year. A special congratulations to diver Colten Sakadales on retrieving the blessed cross at the celebration. Many blessings to him and his family!
 
 

Raising Awareness

January is Human Trafficking Awareness Month. The Pasco County Commission on Human Trafficking has prepared this public service announcement to spread information about how we can all take simple steps to help stop this horrific crime.  
 
 

Constituent Corner

I recently received this note from a constituent who lives in Dunedin.

Thank you for helping me get in touch with the state unemployment office. Prior to contacting your office, I had spent hours on hold trying to get through with no luck. Your staff filed a help ticket for me and a few days later I received a call from someone at the state office who helped me figure out what I needed to do. These extra payments will help my family over the next few weeks. 

This is just one example of the work we do each day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!

Sincerely,
 

Gus Bilirakis

Last Week in Congress!
Last week, I was glad I could provide an update during my live telephone town hall on the important issues being addressed in Washington. 
I enjoyed my recent visits in Hardy County and in Pendleton County. Local stops at churches, libraries and local businesses and meetings with staff at local health centers are especially important now amid economic recovery from the coronavirus. It is great to meet directly with our healthcare workers who are on the frontlines daily ensuring the well-being and health of West Virginians. Their devotion has helped keep our communities safe and healthy throughout the coronavirus outbreak.I was proud to present the Boys & Girls Club of the Eastern Panhandle with an American flag flown over the U.S. Capitol. I was a part of the ceremony to not only to celebrate the kitchen renovation but, more importantly, to honor the ongoing valuable investment that we are making in our children through the fine efforts of the Boys and Girls Club of the Eastern Panhandle. Through this work these children will have more opportunities to learn and grow for bright and promising future.In Congress, I’m proud to cosponsor legislation that will help protect and defend your Second Amendment rights while also ensuring the safety of you and your families. I continue to defend your right to keep and bear arms against the radical left’s gun control agenda. More information on my work to protect these constitutional rights this is in the below newsletter.In this newsletter, you’ll find additional information on my action last week in Congress, COVID-19 resources, opportunities for students and more.
Telephone Townhall 
 
Last week, I was glad I could provide an update during my live telephone town hall on the important issues being addressed in Washington, including creating West Virginia jobs and the federal government’s coronavirus response. The Second Amendment and infrastructure were among the other issues I covered. I was glad to be joined by West Virginia’s COVID-19 Czar, Dr. Clay Marsh for this discussion. If I did not get to address your question or if you would like more information, you can visit Mooney.house.gov to send a message or call my Martinsburg Office at 304-264-8810, Charleston Office at 304-925-5964 or Washington, DC Office at 202-225-2711. Thank you for your attendance and participation! 
  
Protecting Life 
 
Last week, I signed the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act discharge petition. We MUST End Infanticide. We MUST Stand For Life. Now is the time for a vote on the House floor to pass this legislation. I am proud to stand in defense of human life. I will continue to fight to protect the most innocent among us.
  
Financial Services Committee Work 
 
Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government has spent more than $5.3 trillion. An additional $2.3 trillion “infrastructure “proposal (it is estimated that less than 6% of the spending in this proposal would go towards roads and bridges) by the Biden Administration will require a huge tax increase and add to our already skyrocketing debt. The out-of-control spending proposed by President Biden will leave a mess that our children and grandchildren will have to clean up. If we make irresponsible decisions today, then they will be paying for it twenty or thirty years from now. I discussed this during the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services hearing last week. See video clip HERE. 
  
Honoring the Boys & Girls Club 
 
I was truly honored and pleased to be a part of the ceremony recognizing the growth and progress of the Boys & Girls Club of the Eastern Panhandle here in Jefferson County. The kitchen renovation project will be a valuable addition to the services being offered by the Club as they continue their important and extremely worthwhile mission of teaching, training and mentoring our children to become responsible adults and contribute positively to our society.
  
Education and Schools 
 
It was a pleasure to be in Franklin outside of Franklin Elementary School with the beautiful scenery in Pendleton County! We certainly need to do all we can at the federal and state levels to make sure our schools are open for our children to learn and socialize. We are making great strides towards that around the country and certainly in West Virginia. VIDEO here. 
  
  
Collaboration with Our Frontline Workers 
 
I met with Brenda Thompson, Administrative Assistant at E. A. Hawse Health Center in Baker, WV and discussed West Virginia’s leadership in coronavirus vaccine distribution. I recently announced health care grants from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for the E. A. Hawse Health Center. This includes a $308,299 Health Care Cluster grant, a $99,995 grant for Capital Assistance-Disaster Response and Recovery and a $727,985 grant for COVID-19 response. VIDEO here. 
  
Visiting Local Businesses 
 
I enjoyed my visit to the Garden Market in Wardensville. Local stops at churches, libraries and local businesses and meetings with staff at local health centers are especially important now amid economic recovery from the coronavirus. VIDEO here.  
  
U.S. Supreme Court 
 
In their latest attempt to implement their left-wing agenda, Democrats have chosen packing the Supreme Court, a dangerous power grab that would undermine our institutions. Let's not forget in 2019 when then-candidate Joe Biden said, ""I would not get into court packing … we begin to lose any credibility the court has at all.” #SaveSCOTUS
  
On MetroNews Talkline 
 
It was great talking with Hoppy Kercheval on MetroNews Talkine last week about Democrat-led gun control bills in Congress, as well as border security and immigration laws and the insights I received from my trip to the border a few years ago. We also discussed President Biden’s recent decision to withdraw all US troops from Afghanistan and the role Congress should play in foreign policy. Take a listen! Listen to the Podcast here. Listen on Twitter here. 
  
Life at Conception Act Interview 
 
I recently held an interview with EWTN News Nightly on my Life at Conception Act. This legislation would require protection for the preborn under the 14th Amendment, which grants all citizens equal protection under the law and prevents them from being deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law. As a result, preborn babies would be entitled to legal protection under the Constitution as enforced by the states. This legislation would also set a standard for promoting and encouraging a culture of life. 
WATCH my full interview on the Life at Conception Act HERE. 
  
Economic Development 
 
Last week, I received an informative briefing from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers regarding their partnerships with local governments to promote economic development in West Virginia's Second District. 
Defending the Second Amendment 
 
The House recently voted on two bills, H.R. 1446 and H.R. 8, which restrict your gun rights. Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats are still working hard to defund the police and eliminate your Second Amendment rights. Meanwhile they are safely under the protection of gun-holding U.S. Capitol Police and National Guardsmen behind a seven-foot-tall, razor wire fence here at the U.S. Capitol.Why shouldn’t law-abiding citizens in West Virginia also be able to protect yourselves and exercise your Second Amendment rights?Please see full link to my full video on this legislation and what I’m doing in Congress to protect your right to keep and bear arms here. 
  
 
House Democrats recently passed radical legislation that would infringe on Americans’ constitutional right to keep and bear arms. Law-abiding citizens should be able to protect themselves and exercise their Second Amendment rights. We must defend the Second Amendment.In a recent press conference on gun control, President Biden declared: “No amendment to the Constitution is absolute.” Unilaterally implementing gun control measures will make law-abiding Americans less free and less safe. Ignoring the Constitution, Biden is forcing lawful gun owners to comply with an oppressive, ideological agenda. West Virginia citizens must be able to protect their families. 
  
Protecting Our Freedoms 
 
The government should not create a vaccine passport for Americans to travel. The idea of limiting travel and freedoms is completely un-American. Throughout our history people have come to America to enjoy living in freedom, not another oppressive big government controlling our lives and movements. For example, my mother fled communist Cuba where Big Brother is always watching. We must never let that happen in America. That's why I signed this letter to President Biden, along with my colleagues. 
  
U.S. National Debt 
 
We need to be judicious with our dollars. Today we have $28 trillion in national debt. That is more than $84,000 of debt per American citizen. I recently spoke on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives on national debt concerns. I urged my colleagues to consider the future. Please see full link to this video here.

--",M001195,,M001195,"Mooney, Alexander X.",Republican,West Virginia,
12/13/20 17:01,Congress must act,"Friends, 
Wednesday was the third deadliest day in American history. We lost more Americans to COVID-19 than we did on 9/11. Over 3,000 Americans are gone forever. 
The death toll is only rising and the American people need help now, more than ever. That’s why I have not stopped fighting in the Senate for relief for small businesses, workers, and families.
Congress must act. 
The good news is that a vaccine is on the horizon, but we still need to work together to stay safe until it’s widely available. 
Please do all you can to protect yourself, your families and those around you. Wear a mask. Wash your hands. Stay home and avoid large gatherings. Together, we can prevent more tragedy and heartache.
Keep reading to find out what I’ve been working on this week. 
 


ONE: Helping our Neighborhood Restaurants
We all have our favorite restaurants, but they are hurting during the pandemic and many are closing forever. This week, I joined the New Jersey Restaurant & Hospitality Association to talk about the dire need for immediate federal assistance for the hospitality industry, and why I’ve cosponsored the RESTAURANTS Act to give our local eateries the relief they deserve and a chance to survive as we fight COVID-19. Find out how it works. 
 
 
TWO: Fighting for the Smithsonian Latino Museum
American Latinos and Latinas have been making contributions to our country long before the founding of the United States, but when you walk along the National Mall or the halls of the Smithsonian Museums, our story is not being told. For more than two decades, I have fought for the recognition we deserve with a National Museum of the American Latino on D.C.'s National Mall.
On Thursday, I went to the Senate floor to ask my colleagues to pass my bipartisan legislation to do just that, but just one Republican stood up to block it—Senator Mike Lee of Utah. One Republican stands in the way of the hopes and dreams and aspirations of seeing Americans of Latino descent having their dreams fulfilled and being recognized. I won’t stop fighting to get this bill passed. Hear what I said. 
 

THREE: Supporting Individuals with Alzheimer’s
Alzheimer’s disease is personal to me. I still remember my mother’s valiant battle with this cruel disease, as well as the pain of watching it claim her. Tragically, as the number of Americans living with Alzheimer’s and dementia continues to rise, more people are at risk of potential abuse, neglect and exploitation. This week, my Promoting Alzheimer’s Awareness to Prevent Elder Abuse Act passed Congress.

12/11/20 18:20,"Rep. Lowenthal eNewsletter – Dec 11 – Paris Climate Accord, Plastics Waste Plan, Preventing Federal Lands Lease Speculators","In This Edition   This week I introduced a House resolution celebrating the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Paris Climate Agreement.  I called on President-elect Biden this week to adopt the Presidential Plastics Action Plan -- a comprehensive plan that would address the ramifications of plastic pollution on Americans’ health and our environment.  This week, I also called on the Department of Interior (DOI) to delay new oil and gas lease sales to ensure that oil and gas leases on federal lands are not granted to entities unfit to hold them, including land speculators and foreign nationals.  I joined with my colleague Mark Pocan (WI-02) to introduce a House resolution honoring Human Rights Day and the 72nd anniversary of the United Nations’ ratification of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  I applaud President-elect Biden’s choice of California Attorney General Xavier Becerra as the next secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  Lastly, please check out last edition’s poll results and don’t forget to take this edition’s poll at the bottom of the newsletter.   News From Capitol Hill   Anniversary Of The Paris Climate Agreement   I was proud to join this week with my co-chair of the Congressional Safe Climate Caucus, Don Beyer (VA-08), to introduce a House resolution celebrating the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Paris Climate Agreement.   Climate change is a worldwide threat and we are already feeling some of the devastating consequences. It is our responsibility as a nation to do everything in our power to help limit global warming, and to do that we need to work together with the rest of the world.
The Paris Agreement is a global acknowledgement that denial and delay are no longer acceptable, and the only way forward is through cooperation and action.  After President-elect Biden’s pledge to have the U.S. immediately rejoin the Agreement when he takes office next month, we look forward to the U.S. once again becoming a climate leader after the dangerous and irresponsible actions of the Trump Administration. With this resolution marking this important day in history, we show our international allies that we remain firmly committed to the goals of Paris.  Urging Action On Plastic Waste By Biden Administration   Plastic pollution is everywhere – from visible trash in our streets, sidewalks, parking lots, rivers, and waterways to nearly invisible plastic dust raining down in our landscapes and national parks. It is a global crisis that we must address immediately. 
I joined this week with Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley and Rep. Katherine Clark (MA-05) to urge President-elect Biden to adopt the Presidential Plastics Action Plan -- a comprehensive plan that would address the ramifications of plastic pollution on Americans’ health and our environment while also boosting the domestic manufacturing of sustainable alternatives and creating new jobs. 
The plan includes: using the purchasing power of the federal government to eliminate single-use plastic items and replace them with reusable products; suspending and denying permits for new or expanded plastic production facilities, associated infrastructure projects, and exports; making corporate polluters pay and rejecting false solutions; advancing environmental justice in petrochemical regions; updating existing federal regulations to curtail pollution from plastic facilities by using best available science and technology; stopping federal subsidies to plastic producers; joining international efforts to establish binding commitments to reduce plastic use and eliminate single-use plastics; and, reducing and mitigating the impacts of discarded and lost fishing gear.   Preventing Speculation On Federal Land Leases   This week I joined with 15 of my House colleagues to call on the Department of Interior (DOI) to delay new oil and gas lease sales to ensure that the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) does not grant oil and gas leases on federal lands to entities unable to hold them, including land speculators and foreign nationals.  In a letter to DOI Secretary David Bernhardt, we expressed our concern about, “…recent troubling lease sales by BLM to individuals with no apparent previous experience or history in energy development. These concerns are heightened in light of recent reports that nearly half of the leases sold at recent BLM lease sales have been acquired by individuals who may be unqualified oil and gas speculators.”  We also pointed out that there are indications that some of these individuals who were awarded leases may be foreign nationals. The Mineral Leasing Act (MLA) disqualifies non-U.S. citizens from owning federal oil, gas, and geothermal leases in their own name.  We concluded the letter by demanding answers from BLM on how its current leasing process vets individuals and pointing out that, “It appears that the DOI’s current process is not properly designed to identify and deter potentially unlawful or unqualified bids on federal oil and gas leasing. The DOI must not move forward with future oil and gas lease sales unless it can guarantee that the entities and individuals successfully acquiring federal oil, gas, and geothermal leases are not speculators and are lawfully eligible to do so under the MLA. These lands belong to the American people and they are entitled to a fair return on the sales and development of these lands. “ 
Honoring Human Rights Day   This week, Rep. Mark Pocan (WI-02) and I led many colleagues in the House and Senate to introduce a resolution honoring Human Rights Day and the 72nd anniversary of the United Nations’ ratification of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Since joining Congress in 2013, I have introduced this resolution each December to remind us of the basic rights and freedoms we as Americans enjoy, but that are denied to so many people around the world.   Our nation was founded on the basic principles of life, freedom, and humanity that are enshrined in the UDHR, and we must remain a beacon of freedom and hope throughout the world. It is our duty and responsibility to continue to advocate and fight for the universal protection of human rights.   Click here to read the full text of the resolution.   A Bold Choice For Secretary Of Health And Human Services  This week I was very pleased to see President-elect Biden select California Attorney General Xavier Becerra as the next head of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). AG Becerra has fought to expand access to health care and to defend the Affordable Care Act both here in California and as a leader in Congress. He is an outstanding pick to lead HHS and bring his tremendous leadership and thoughtfulness to tackle the pandemic and build a fairer system for all. I am also proud to call him a friend. 

  Last Edition’s Poll Results   Former Presidents Clinton, Bush, and Obama, along with President-elect Biden all plan to take the COVID-19 vaccine publicly on TV. Would this make you more confident to take the vaccine?   58% - Yes 32% - No   9% - Don't know/Unsure

12/11/20 17:50,COVID Vaccine Updates,"Dear Friend,   I hope you and your family are staying safe during the recent COVID spikes in our community.    Today, I want to provide you with an update on the distribution of the COVID vaccine in our state, remind you of an important health care coverage deadline, and share my special tribute to a Maryland icon.
 
COVID VACCINE UPDATE 
FDA approval for the Pfizer vaccine is imminent, and Maryland is set to receive roughly 155,000 doses within the next two weeks. Governor Larry Hogan just released the state’s plans for the initial rollout of the vaccine, prioritizing health care workers and long term care facilities. You can read more about this plan here.   While distribution plans are still being finalized by the Governor, I’m laser-focused on making sure everyone in my district can get the vaccine as quickly and as fairly as possible. 

Do you plan on learning more about the Governor’s vaccine plans once more information becomes available? 
  
YES
 
NO
*By participating in this poll, you agree to receive updates from me and my team. 

HOW TO GET COVERED 
During open enrollment, you can purchase, renew, or alter your 2021 health insurance plan through Maryland’s marketplace. You must enroll by December 15th in order to have your coverage begin on January 1, 2021.   As the coronavirus pandemic continues, I want to encourage you to make sure you have health insurance for this coming year. At the Maryland Health Connection online marketplace, you can compare affordable options from insurance plans you recognize.

HONORING A MARYLAND LEGEND 

Rep. Trone honors the late Senator Sarbanes on the House floor. 
This week, our state lost a legend. Senator Paul Sarbanes dedicated his life to the betterment of our state and our country.   Senator Sarbanes was a champion for justice, drafting the first article of impeachment against a corrupt president. He was a champion for fairness, tackling corporate regulatory reform to ensure transparency for investors. Most of all, he was a champion for our beloved Chesapeake Bay, spearheading efforts to protect and preserve it for generations to come.   I spoke on the House floor this week to honor Senator Sarbanes. You can watch my speech here. 

COVID-19 COMMUNITY RESOURCE GUIDE

5/14/21 10:30,Veterans and Vaccines,"May 14, 2021 
Did you know that our district has one of the largest veteran populations in the country? It’s true. And it means that every day I work to help those who have sacrificed and served our country. One of the ways I’ve done that is by having a veteran as a member of my team. Right now, I’m proud to have a service member on my staff in Washington, but there’s an exciting opportunity for a veteran in New Jersey I want to share with you. 
My office is hiring a Wounded Warrior fellow – a two-year paid fellowship to work in either Toms River or Willingboro – that is open to honorably discharged veterans released from active duty within the past five years who have a 20 percent or greater service-connected disability. 
You can find more about the position, and apply directly at usajobs.gov or directly through the U.S. House of Representatives by clicking here. If you’re not a veteran but know one, I hope you share this with friends and family. 
There’s one more thing I’m optimistic about as we head into the weekend: vaccinations. It’s great to see more and more people getting vaccinated across our state, and for those of you who haven’t had a chance, it’s easier now more than ever. 
If you want to find out how to get a COVID-19 vaccine, visit New Jersey vaccine website by clicking here. You can also sign up for my daily COVID-19 e-newsletter, which has all the latest information on pop-up clinics and other ways to find vaccine sites near year. 
The news from the CDC yesterday that vaccinated individuals are safe to do normal activities without masks just shows how important it is for all of us to get our vaccine. Please stay safe and healthy, and always reach out if there’s any way I can be of help.

4/26/21 21:18,District Update: Vaccines Distributed Across Arkansas,"District Update | April 26, 2021
View Email in Browser 
 
Dear Friend,
The first visitor to my Washington office since the pandemic started was none other than Col. (Ret.) Rob Ator – Governor Hutchinson’s appointee managing the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. I appreciate Col. Ator coming to my office to brief my staff and me on critical vaccine updates in Arkansas.
He informed me of Arkansas’s success effectively distributing the vaccine, which is key to coming out of this pandemic and returning our communities back to the pre-pandemic way of life. 
Vaccines are now available throughout Arkansas and everyone who is over 16 years of age is eligible.  
I encourage you to get vaccinated.
To do so, make an appointment at a community pharmacy or visit a vaccine clinic through hospitals, health care providers, or your work. For more information, visit the Arkansas Department of Health’s website. 



THE BIDEN BORDER CRISIS RAGES ON
Every day, cartels, fueled by fees for human trafficking and the drug trade, are dropping migrant minors and families across the American border.  
They are leaving them to fend for themselves, and it’s not right.
During my trip to the southwest border recently, I saw firsthand why the number of migrants coming to the United States is out of control. I watched migrant families and unaccompanied minors walk across our border into our country and present themselves to the border patrol for processing. 
President Biden and his so-called “Border Czar” Vice President Harris are missing in action.
Vice President Harris has been everywhere but the border, and she and her boss have so far REFUSED to bear witness the crisis themselves.
And, they have yet to take any action that would materially change the situation and stop the humanitarian crisis and tragedy.
It’s time they take this seriously.
Read about my seventh visit to the border in the Washington Examiner.  Not only do I recount the humanitarian crisis I observed but I offer the urgently needed action the Biden-Harris Administration could take to address the crisis.

ALHPA PHI ALPHA 75TH ANNUAL SOUTHWEST REGIONAL CONVENTION
I was honored to address the members of the Alpha Phi Alpha meeting for their annual convention in Little Rock last week.
From my participation in Phi Kappa Psi, I understand the values that a fraternity provides collegiate men with. I was happy to attend this regional convention for one of the premier fraternities in the nation and was delighted that they chose Little Rock!  
I’m glad to see that, despite this difficult pandemic year, the brothers of Alpha Phi Alpha are still able to congregate safely and share fellowship with one another.
Alpha men helped build this country. Alpha Phi Alpha members are intelligent and savvy, and I was glad to have had the opportunity visit with them. 


CONGRATULATIONS TO MY FUTURE LEADERS COUNCIL
I enjoyed meeting with my Future Leaders Council this month for our first in-person meeting to close the 2020-21 school year. 

I started the Future Leaders Council in 2017, and it is comprised of fifth graders from across central Arkansas. We meet four times during the school year to learn about the Constitutional roots and practical sides of being a citizen of this great nation. 
You might call it a “booster shot” for the civics education the students already receive in school.  
I come away from these visits hopeful and encouraged by the students’ curiosity, their interest in our political system, and their love for our nation. 
Are you a rising 5th grader, interested in learning about the U.S. Constitution, federalism, checks and balances, or how a bill becomes a law? Do you know one who is?  The application process for the 2021-22 school year is now open. If you’re interested, please contact my Little Rock Office at 501-324-5941 or at Hill.House.gov for more information.

BIDEN’S BACKDOOR BILLIONS

The Biden Administration wants to send billions of no strings attached dollars to China, Russia, Iran, Syria, and Venezuela.
Last week, I joined former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and my colleagues at the Republican Study Committee for a press conference in support of the Max Pressure Act. The bill would continue the Trump Administration’s max pressure strategy on Iran and specifically prohibit Iran from accessing Special Drawing Rights funding from the International Monetary Fund – an issue on which I have long advocated. 

The Biden Administration should not be promoting the access of billions in hard currency to support these countries. Earlier this year, I introduced H.R. 1568 to stop Democrats’ blank check to genocidal regimes and state sponsors of terrorism.  It’s a commonsense solution to something that should concern all Americans. 


ONE TRILLION TREES TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE
I am a proud co-sponsor of the bipartisan Trillion Trees Act, and I congratulate my fellow Arkansan, Congressman Bruce Westerman, for his leadership in introducing this bill. 
The Trillion Trees Act will not only make our atmosphere cleaner, it also will make our forests healthier, stronger, and more resilient.
The Trillion Trees Act will restore and grow one trillion trees worldwide. Studies show that restoring one trillion new trees globally would sequester 205 gigatons of carbon, an amount equivalent to two-thirds of all manmade emissions remaining in the atmosphere today. 
It’s elegant in its simplicity.
Ideas like these are realistic solutions to improve our environment - unlike the Green New Deal which would cost American taxpayers trillions and outlaw the use of affordable energy, destroying millions of jobs and increasing costs to heat and cool our homes.

Sincerely,
 
Representative French Hill

2/27/21 12:11,"The Democrats' ""COVID Stimulus"" is Neither","The Democrats' ""COVID Stimulus"" is Neither
 
 
Americans are desperate for the COVID-19 vaccine. Our main street businesses are hurting. Millions of Americans are still out of work. Schools remain closed across the nation. 
 
These are the real problems we’re facing. And yet, the Democrats' partisan proposal ignores them all. 
 

WATCH: Congressman Brady speaks on the floor against the Democrat’s partisan payoff bill.
 
In fact, only 9% of the $1.9 trillion in this bill is spent on combating the virus. The truth is, the Democrats' ""COVID stimulus"" is neither. 
 
Instead of creating jobs, the Democrats are dishing out money to special interest groups, including: 
	•	$350 billion bailout for blue states 
	•	$12 billion for foreign aid
	•	$100M for a rail project to Silicon Valley 
	•	$135 million for the National Endowment for the Humanities 
	•	$50M for environmental justice grants 
	•	$1.5M for a bridge connecting Canada to NY 
	•	And more….
It doesn’t have to be this way. For the last five COVID-19 emergency aid bills Republicans and Democrats worked together, and were able to deliver the largest recovery package in American history – over $3.5 trillion. But this time, by refusing to work together, President Joe Biden and Democrats in Congress are punishing the American people. 
 

 
Instead of this political payoff, let’s find common ground on what’s truly urgent: crushing the virus, rebuilding this economy, saving Main Street businesses and getting people back to work.

ACTIONS TODAY = FUTURE WELLBEING
 
  
This week we celebrated Earth Day and recognized it as an important reminder that our actions today determine our wellbeing in the future. Coloradans enjoy the outdoors and are blessed to have access to great public lands and a great quality of life. We need to act on climate change to ensure we can continue to enjoy these things and protect our planet for future generations.  

This week is also National Park Week, a time to celebrate our beautiful and historic public lands and recognize the National Park Service’s work to preserve our nation’s stunning landscapes, hallowed sites, and shared cultural history. I hope you will celebrate National Park Week by spending some time outdoors and visiting one of Colorado’s four national parks. Visit www.nps.gov for more information and activities for you and your family. 
  
  
 
JUSTICE & ACCOUNTABILITY
 
  
This week, former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty on all charges in the murder of George Floyd in May 2020. George Floyd’s family and his community deserved justice in this case and I’m glad to see that justice was served. The murder of George Floyd was a terrible, brutal tragedy and should never have happened. 
 
We still have a lot of work to do in this country to address the inequality and injustice that exists. I’m glad the U.S. House has taken a first step in passing legislation to reform police practices and hold bad actors accountable. Click here to learn more about the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act.
  
  
 
SAFE BANKING
 
This week, the U.S. House of Representatives once again passed landmark legislation to reform federal cannabis laws and reduce the public safety risk in communities across the country. The SAFE Banking Act would allow marijuana-related businesses in states with some form of legalized marijuana and strict regulatory structures to access the banking system. The bill passed with overwhelming, bipartisan support by a vote of 321 to 101, including 106 Republicans.
  

  
After years of working on this issue, I’m thrilled to see overwhelming bipartisan support for this commonsense legislation in the U.S. House once again. There are other marijuana issues that need to be addressed, including additional research, tax issues and criminal justice reforms, but passing the SAFE Banking Act is a critical element of cannabis reform that cannot wait. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to pass the bill and get it signed into law to save lives and protect our communities.
  
  
 
COVID IN COLORADO
 
 
Vaccine Distribution
 
State public health officials announced this week that Coloradans who have received the COVID vaccine are more than 90% less likely to contract the virus and much less likely to be hospitalized. This is good news and further demonstrates the benefit and need for as many Coloradans as possible to get vaccinated.
 
Colorado is currently vaccinating all Coloradans ages 16+ for Pfizer and 18+ for Moderna. Click here for a list of vaccine providers in Adams County and Jefferson County. As always, my office is here to help you and answer your questions, call us at (303) 274-7944.
 
Economic Impact Payments 
 
Thanks to the passage of the American Rescue Plan, qualifying Americans across the country began receiving a third round of Economic Impact Payments in March. For most, these payments have been delivered automatically by the IRS to Americans who filed a federal income tax return in 2019 or 2020. For those who have not received the third stimulus payment but believe they are eligible, the IRS is encouraging individuals to file their 2020 taxes as soon as possible. 
 
Additionally, for individuals who have not received the first or second Economic Impact Payment, the IRS is advising to claim a Recovery Rebate Credit on your 2020 taxes. The payments will either be applied to the owed 2020 tax liability or credited along with the appropriate refund. Those who submitted their 2020 taxes without claiming this credit will need to submit an amended return in order to claim the first and second payments. For more information on the Economic Impact Payments and the Recovery Rebate Credit, please visit www.irs.gov/coronavirus/economic-impact-payments or call my district office at (303) 274-7944.

5/7/21 12:59,Our Shot to Get Back to Normal: Update on Vaccines Across Michigan,"Friend – 
We’ve made incredible progress in rolling out COVID-19 vaccines during the past few months, and now every Michigander over the age of 16 can get vaccinated.  As we approach summer, I know we all want things to get back to normal as soon as possible. That means this is a crucial stretch for Michiganders to be vaccinated so we can protect ourselves, loved ones, neighbors, friends and co-workers and stop the spread of this virus.   I cannot stress this enough: if you haven’t received your COVID-19 vaccine – which is safe, effective and free – please do so as soon as possible. You can find out where to get one closest to you by clicking here.   This week, I visited vaccination sites in Lansing, Traverse City and Grand Rapids to see the incredible work being done on the ground. 

As Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I secured and helped enact $50 billion in funding for FEMA’s Disaster Relief Fund – which has gone towards setting up mass vaccination sites across the country, including at Ford Field. I also worked with state officials and the Biden Administration to secure additional federal resources – including over 200 additional personnel to come to Michigan and administer and accelerate COVID-19 vaccines across our state.   I will continue working to make sure the federal government is doing everything possible to ensure Michigan has the resources needed to distribute vaccines quickly, equitably and efficiently.  We each have a critical role to play in combating this pandemic—and getting vaccinated is a critical step.

Dear Lindsey,  
On Tuesday, I visited Scranton Primary Health Center to thank Scranton police and firefighters as over 60 of them received their second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.
  
  


  
These frontline heroes never stopped reporting for duty since the start of this pandemic to protect us. They braved the risk of COVID-19 to keep us safe. For that, we owe them a debt of gratitude.
  
 
Big News for NEPA from the Appropriations Committee
 
  
This week, I was elected to serve as Chairman for the powerful Appropriations subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science.
 
I have always viewed bringing our fair share of federal investments back to this area as one of the most impactful things I can do as a U.S. Representative, and this leadership role will help expand Northeastern Pennsylvania’s share.
 
In this position, I look forward to directing money to help our small businesses recover from the pandemic, bring home new jobs, and expand opportunities for local companies to do business with the federal government. These are challenging times, but Northeastern Pennsylvania has great potential for growth, and I am optimistic about our future.
  
 
$122 Million for NEPA Schools
 
  
On Friday, my team and I announced over $122 million in coronavirus relief funding for more than 30 school districts in Northeastern Pennsylvania. 
 
For almost a year, COVID-19 has disrupted our children’s education. Schools are fighting to provide their students with uninterrupted and high-quality education in these challenging times. Our COVID-19 response needs to protect young Americans and the educators and staff who support them. We can not let our children fall behind because of this pandemic.
 
This federal funding will help schools create safe and productive learning environments for our kids, because we know that there is no substitute for in-person learning -- especially in the early years of a child's life.
  
 
FYI: Vaccine Production & Distribution 
 
  
This national COVID-19 vaccination campaign is unlike any effort we have ever undertaken, but we are finally mobilizing the federal government behind a comprehensive plan to change the course of this pandemic. 
 
Here's how the federal government is working to get more shots in arms faster:

  
Be safe and well,

Comparing vaccination rates. Marianas vaccination rates are slightly behind Guam but ahead of the other U.S. insular areas, according to a new analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. Although most insular areas initially got off to a strong start, they all now lag the rest of America in the percentage of the population fully vaccinated against COVID-19. 
 

Rescue Plan: Rental assistance

Emergency rental assistance from the American Rescue Plan is available to those in need in the Marianas. The U.S. Treasury Department published the websites of each state and territory this week to assist renters get help paying rent, utilities, deposits, and penalties for the period from March 2020 through April 2021. The Commonwealth’s website with information on who qualifies and how to apply is here. The Emergency Rental Assistance is offered to U.S. citizens and Permanent Residents, as well as those with the Long-Term CNMI Resident status created in my legislation, U.S. Public Law 116-24. Under terms of Section 3201 of the American Rescue Plan the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianas Islands has been allocated $10,400,669.30 on the basis of population for the Emergency Rental Assistance program. According to the Commonwealth’s website, interested renters may call (670) 682-7368/RENT for more information or e-mail: dcalvo.ccera@gmail.com. 
 
 

Pandemic EBT available

Families with school-age children may now apply for the Pandemic EBT food aid that Congress provided the Marianas in the continuing resolution last October. The estimated $11.1 million for pandemic EBT will help pay the cost of meals that students would have received, if they had been attending school in-person. The rate of reimbursement is $7.97 per day. Some 11,671 students are expected to be eligible. According to the Public School System, students were given applications last week to bring home. All completed applications must be turned in to the PSS Child Nutrition Program Office on Capital Hill or the CNMI Nutrition Assistance Program in As Lito by June 11, 2021 4:30 p.m. ChST. Read the Commonwealth’s State Plan here. More information and answers to frequently asked questions are available here. 
 
 

Restaurant relief fund is closing

Restaurants in the Marianas have until Tuesday, May 25, at 10 a.m. ChST to apply for direct relief through the Restaurant Revitalization Fund. The $28.6 billion Restaurant Revitalization Fund is part of the American Rescue Plan that Democrats in Congress passed and President Biden signed into law in March. The Fund provides restaurants and other hard-hit food businesses with funding equal to their pandemic-related revenue loss up to $10 million. The relief does not have to be repaid, provided that the funds are put toward eligible uses by March 11, 2023. A funding guide is available here, and a sample application here. Entities eligible to apply include restaurants, caterers, bars, bakeries, and breweries. 
 

FAST grants for NMI businesses
      
Marianas businesses may now apply for the U.S. Small Business Administration’s Federal and State Technology (FAST) partnership program, which I made available in the National Defense Authorization Act last year. FAST makes up to $125,000 available to help women and people from economically-disadvantaged backgrounds or rural areas compete for $3 billion in federal seed money for business start-ups. Public or private entities can use FAST grants to fund proposals, outreach and technical assistance to small businesses interested in competing for the federal Small Business Innovation Research and Small Business Technology Transfer programs. Applications are due Friday, June 4, 6 a.m. ChST. Apply here and read more about the program here. 
 
 

Supporting vulnerable students

Students, who are homeless or in foster care, have lower success rates in the best of times, but during the pandemic the challenges for these young people have only worsened. I called a hearing Wednesday, as Chairman of the Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education Subcommittee, to hear firsthand how the pandemic has impacted homeless and foster students and to learn whether funding we provided in the American Rescue Plan is helping them. The Marianas Public School System received over $160 million from the American Rescue Plan to pay for teachers, staff, and other resources to help students keep up with their education and remain connected to their schools. School leaders, an academic researcher, and a foster parent all testified before the subcommittee at this week’s hearing on the effectiveness of those funds. Watch the hearing here. 
 
 

API essay contest ends soon. In celebration of API Heritage Month, your congressional office is sponsoring our first ever API Heritage Month Essay Contest. The contest is a chance for middle school and high school students in the Northern Marianas to reflect on their experiences and share their stories about growing up within the Asian and Pacific Islander community. One middle school winner and one high school winner will be selected to have their essay published in the Congressional Record. For more information and to enter this year’s contest, visit the contest webpage at sablan.house.gov. 
 
 

DC office reopening

With the announcement last week by Congress’ Office of the Attending Physician that fully-vaccinated staff may return to their pre-pandemic work activities, your congressional office in Washington has reopened after a year of teleworking. All fully-vaccinated staff are in the office full-time, although we continue to ask visitors entering to wear a mask and maintain social distance, because we cannot know their vaccination status. We also recommend visitors set up an appointment before coming to the office, so crowding does not occur. Teleworking from their homes presented unique challenges for your congressional staff, but they were able to maintain a high level of productivity. In this period, the American Rescue Plan, the CARES Act, and the FY21 omnibus appropriation and relief measure included significant, Marianas-specific benefits to help the people we represent get through the coronavirus and continue recovery from the typhoons of 2018. We hope you did not see any reduction in our work; and we thank you for your understanding during this unprecedented pandemic. 
 
 

Your Questions Answered. You can ask me any questions you have about federal policy, legislation, or other aspects of my work in Congress in my monthly Constituent Q&A. Submit your questions for this month on my Instagram page between 11 a.m., Monday, May 24, and 11 a.m., Tuesday, May 25 ChST. I look forward to answering your questions and hearing what issues are most important to you. 
 
 

Tell your story. Whether you’re an educator with exciting new research, an organization with an innovative concept, or a family on the frontlines, your voice deserves to be heard, says Rules Committee Chair Jim McGovern. He is inviting Americans to share their story and help guide our work to finally end hunger now. “We have the food, the ability, and the means to end hunger in America — what we lack is the political will and moral courage to act. We must change that."" Tell your story here.

NEWS FROM THE 15th DISTRICT
Dear Friends, 
I hope you and your families are safe and well. I wanted to provide a brief update about what we have been working on to serve the people of the 15th Congressional District of Texas. Together, we will continue to seize opportunities and overcome the challenges our communities face.Congressman Gonzalez Leads Bipartisan Delegation to the Border On Sunday, April 11, and Monday, April 12, I led fellow Members of the Problem Solvers Caucus, a bipartisan group of Democrats and Republicans, on a fact-finding mission to the Southern border.The Members in attendance represented all parts of the country from New York to Hawai’i. I was proud to host Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (PA-01), Rep. Josh Gottheimer (NJ-05), Rep. Tom Suozzi (NY-03), Rep. Jimmy Panetta (CA-20), Rep. Young Kim (CA-39), Rep. Conor Lamb (PA-17), Rep. Ed Case (HI-01) and Rep. Dan Meuser (PA-09).The delegation met Sister Norma Pimentel, the Executive Director of the Catholic Charities of the Rio Grande Valley, who discussed the humanitarian work her organization does and the root causes of Central American migration. Members also were given a tour of the Catholic Charities Rio Grande Valley Respite Center and met with community volunteers and migrants and discussed their experiences.
 
Following the tour, we did a ride-along with Constable Lazaro “Larry” Gallardo, Hidalgo County Constable Precinct 3 at Anzalduas Park in Mission, Texas to see the encampments of migrants visible from the banks of the Rio Grande Valley and view areas where migrants are known to cross into the United States. My colleagues and I were able to get a clearer understanding of the cooperation between local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies and the impact irregular migration has on our local budgets.
 
Members then heard from Federal District Judge Ricardo Hinojosa and various local leaders and law enforcement personnel about their on the ground experiences with the influx of migrants. 
 
On Monday, April 12, the delegation visited McAllen Border Patrol Station for a tour of the outdoor migrant processing facility. The Members then visited the Donna Land Port of Entry and the U.S. Border Patrol Donna Soft-sided Facility, which serves to safely process individuals in U.S. Border Patrol custody. 
 
The Congressional Delegation ended with a Rio Grande Boat Tour with Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS). Texas DPS and the Texas National Guard briefed Members on Operation Lone Star, a joint DPS-Texas National Guard operation which deploys air, ground, marine, and tactical border security assets to high-threat areas to deny cartels and other smugglers the ability to move drugs and people into the state. 
 
We ended the visit with a bipartisan press conference to express our gratitude to the local, state, and federal law enforcement and leadership for their efforts and highlight the need for both parties to work together to break through the gridlock on immigration and many other issues. We all know that these solutions will take time, but I am confident that this group will lead the way to address the immigration challenges ahead in a bipartisan manner. I promise to keep you updated on our next steps. 
 
The press conference can be viewed here. My Letter to President Biden on Optimizing Pharmacies for COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout On Tuesday, April 13, I, along with 16 of my colleagues, wrote a letter to President Biden urging his administration to optimize the utilization of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program (FRPP). This would bolster vaccination efforts by community retail pharmacies and increase the number of vaccinations given in a shorter period of time.. The more options we have to inoculate those at risk and the general populace, the faster we can overcome the COVID-19 pandemic. Read my letter to President Biden here.Head Start Program Funding for the Community Council of South Central Texas (CCST) I am pleased to announce that The Head Start Program has awarded $1,295,684 to the Community Council of South Central Texas to promote readiness for pre-school children from low-income families in Guadalupe and Comal Counties. This award provides a multitude of assistance in educational, nutritional, health, social, and special services to families in Central Texas. I am committed to ensuring our schools, parents, and children have the resources they need to succeed and raise the next generation of leaders. Read my press release here.Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) Reform Too many Central and South Texas teachers, firefighters, police officers, and public servants are currently or will, in the future, be penalized by the Windfall Elimination Provision. That is why I co-sponsored H.R. 2337, the Public Servants Protection and Fairness Act of 2021. This critical legislation aims to secure the benefits for our hardworking public servants. Those who dedicate their lives to helping our community should not be punished or forgotten upon retirement. Read my press release here.Reminders & Updates Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) COVID-19 Funeral Assistance FEMA is now accepting applications for funeral assistance for Texans who have lost loved ones to COVID-19.Those who have paid for funeral expenses for an individual whose death may have been caused by or was likely the result of COVID-19 after January 20, 2020, can apply for up to $9,000 in assistance per funeral. FEMA’s call center can be reached at (844) 684-6333; TTY (800) 462-7585, Monday-Friday from 8 AM CST – 8 PM CST. Multilingual services will be available.Learn more from FEMA here.Veterans Start Receiving Economic Impact Payments This Week As part of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Texas veterans and their beneficiaries, who receive Compensation and Pension (C&P) benefit payments and don’t normally file a tax return, will start receiving payments of $1,400 this week.In most cases, the payments will be automatically deposited into a bank account or loaded onto the Direct Express cards where veterans receive their benefits. Those waiting on paper checks or debit cards through the mail should expect to receive their payments over the next several days. I encourage all Central and South Texans to use the “Get My Payment” tool from IRS.gov to check the status of their payments and make sure they receive their money.Tax Filing Deadline The Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service announced earlier this month that the federal income tax filing due date for individuals for the 2020 tax year will be automatically extended from April 15, 2021, to May 17, 2021. As always, it is my sincere honor to represent the 15th District of Texas. Please reach out to my office if you have any questions or concerns relating to federal matters.

4/30/21 18:17,"@MyKitchenTable: April 30, 2021","News from Representative Upton 


April 30, 2021 
@MyKitchenTable: Friday, April 30, 2021
Dear Friend: 
A line from Senator Tim Scott’s address in response to President Biden’s joint address to Congress: “So I am more than hopeful — I am confident — that our finest hour is yet to come. Original sin is never the end of the story. Not in our souls, and not for our nation. The real story is always redemption.”  If you missed the President’s speech or Senator Scott’s speech from earlier this week, I’d encourage you to watch them which you can do HERE and HERE.  The President’s speech Wednesday night offered support to update our 21st Century Cures legislation with Cures 2.0 and ARPA-H injection of additional research dollars to deal with COVID, cancer, and Alzheimer’s in the years ahead. ARPA-H would be a new health agency that would build on our goal of speeding up the development of treatments and cures. You can read more about it HERE. This was certainly welcome news and should generate overwhelming bipartisan support.  Unfortunately the rest of the speech appeared to be a long wish list of big spending priorities. Look, now that the economy has begun to recover, and there appears to be trillions of dollars still in the pipeline from already approved COVID relief packages, we shouldn’t be proposing trillions more in pipe-dream spending that will either dramatically increase the national debt or raise taxes on small business and families. We also are hearing from countless small businesses in southwest Michigan that have expressed how they cannot find workers because folks are making more money from the government by not having a job. This needs to be fixed.  We should follow the path that President Biden himself outlined in his inaugural address calling for bipartisanship and cooperation, which are sorely needed as we begin the discussion on an infrastructure bill. Earlier this week I talked with WSJM about our efforts in the Problem Solvers Caucus to ignite a bipartisan discussion on infrastructure priorities, which you read more about HERE. 

Yesterday, Governor Whitmer announced a set of specific benchmarks in order to restore normalcy in Michigan, calling it the “MI Vacc to Normal Challenge.” She outlined a four-step process where after a certain percentage of Michiganders 16 and older receive at least one dose of the vaccine, certain restrictions will be lifted. The first step, which we will likely hit next week, allows more people to return to office buildings. The next step increases some capacity restrictions, then lifts all capacity restrictions, and the final step removes all limits and health orders. We certainly have a ways to go, but things are trending in the right direction. We need all Michiganders over 16 to get the vaccine as soon as possible to restore that normalcy we all so desperately miss. You can schedule an appointment HERE. You can read more about the Governor’s announcement yesterday HERE.  Currently, the state has administered 6.9 million vaccines. 50% of Michiganders 16 and older have received at least one dose, and 38% are fully vaccinated.

 Earlier this week, the Health Subcommittee held a hearing called, “The Long Haul: Forging a Path through the Lingering Effects of COVID-19,” which looked at COVID Long Haulers. We talked with Francis Collins, and some good news we discussed is that the vaccines appear to remedy some of the ill effects. Yet another important reason for everyone to get the vaccine. 
 One fun story you might be interested in – I did a Q&A with a DC newspaper Roll Call about my time as a Congressional staffer working for David Stockman and then as a staffer for President Reagan’s Office of Management and Budget before being elected to congress in 1986. Here’s a photo of me and Stockman, and you can read the Q&A HERE. 

I also wanted to share a couple photos from a St. Joe resident. They captured a picture-perfect Lake Michigan sunset over the bluff, and then had a frequent visitor from the den below! TY for sharing!  Next week, we have two important hearings in the Energy & Commerce Committee. We have a Health Subcommittee hearing looking at ways to lower the cost of prescription drugs while still ensuring we allow for innovation and the development of more cures and life-saving treatments. We also have an Energy Subcommittee hearing on the CLEAN Future Act. Stay tuned!  Have a great weekend, 
  Fred Upton

Last Week in Congress!
Last week was another busy week in Congress and across the West Virginia’s Second District. In Congress, I’m proud to cosponsor legislation that will help protect and defend your Second Amendment rights while also ensuring the safety of you and your families. I’m also proud to cosponsor legislation that protects innocent life in the womb. I continue to advocate for the completion of the Corridor H, which would allow for more private industry jobs to be created here in the Mountain State.Happy National Travel and Tourism Week! Make sure to get out and explore Wild & Wonderful West Virginia with your family, friends and loved ones!In this newsletter, you’ll find additional information on my action last week in Congress, COVID-19 resources, open grant applications, volunteer opportunities and more. For the latest COVID-19 vaccine information, visit www.vaccinate.wv.gov or call 1-833-734-0965. 
  
  
National Travel and Tourism Week 
 
May 2-8 is National Travel and Tourism Week! This is a great time for Mountaineers and visitors to experience all the beauty and attractions that Wild & Wonderful West Virginia has to offer. I will be posting many great destinations on my social media throughout the week so keep an eye out! 
  
Corridor H 
 
For years, I’ve advocated for robust funding for Corridor H. I am continuing to work in Congress to secure funding for the completion of this highway. This photo was taken about ten miles from the Virginia border. Watch my video HERE. I’ve introduced legislation, the AID in Appalachia Act, to provide Appalachian states like West Virginia with increased flexibility and funding for projects like Corridor H. In West Virginia, this highway would allow for more private industry jobs to be created. When it is completed, this will open up the middle of our state in a beautiful way. 
  
Service Recognition 
 
Thank you Chief Meader for 40 years of paid and volunteer service to the Elkins Fire Department and the citizens of Elkins. Meader joined the fire department in 1979 as a volunteer and 40 years later retires as the Chief. He says he will always love the fire service, and we say thank you for your dedication and best wishes in the future. This picture shows members of the Elkins Fire Department. 
  
Recognizing Local Businesses 
 
The coronavirus and government shutdowns have especially hurt small businesses, so I want to continue to encourage you to support shops and stores in your neighborhoods. Spring is here and summer is just around the corner! One great business for this beautiful time of the year in West Virginia is River Riders, based in Harper’s Ferry. They have tubing, white water rafting, and paddle boarding for the whole family to enjoy. This can be a great way for your family to enjoy outdoor activities together while also supporting a local business. Local businesses are the lifeblood of our communities, and supporting them means you’re supporting our neighbors. Watch my full video on this HERE. 
  
  
Seneca Rocks Visit 
 
I enjoyed visiting beautiful Seneca Rocks in Pendleton County! I encourage you to come out here and enjoy this beauty and see why we live in the greatest country in the world.
  
U.S. Supreme Court 
 
Over 150 years ago, Congress determined there should be nine Supreme Court Justices. Far-left Democrat lawmakers now want to break with tradition so they can create a Court that will rubber stamp their progressive agenda. Watch my video on this issue HERE. 
 
In their latest attempt to implement their left-wing agenda, Democrats have chosen packing the Supreme Court, a dangerous power grab that would undermine our institutions. Let's not forget in 2019 when then-candidate Joe Biden said, ""I would not get into court packing … we begin to lose any credibility the court has at all.” #SaveSCOTUS
DC Statehood 
 
In Congress we recently voted on the Democrats’ bill to make Washington, DC the 51st state. This is unconstitutional and nothing more than an attempt to get two more progressive senators added to the Senate. Washington, DC was created to be a federal district so that no state had control over the nation’s Capitol. 
  
  
Berkeley Day Report Center Building Grand Opening 
 
I'm proud to recognize the dedication and Grand Opening of the new Berkeley Day Report Center Building. My sincere congratulations to all involved who have contributed to establishing this important facility for the treatment of substance abuse. As these doors open, it is with much hope and optimism that I look at the treatment options and therapies that will be available for those who are battling their substance abuse, drug dependency and addiction. I am encouraged that through such treatment, individuals can be healed and return to having active and meaningful lives that not only restore families but also strengthen our community. 
  
  
Urging Federal Disaster Declaration 
 
Our West Virginia congressional delegation has urged President Biden to support Governor Justice's request for a federal disaster declaration for the State of West Virginia. This is in response to severe winter weather in February that affected our communities, including impacting essential services and damaging several roadways in the state. 
  
Defending the Second Amendment 
 
The House recently voted on two bills, H.R. 1446 and H.R. 8, which restrict your gun rights. Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats are still working hard to defund the police and eliminate your Second Amendment rights. Meanwhile they are safely under the protection of gun-holding U.S. Capitol Police and National Guardsmen here at the U.S. Capitol. Why shouldn’t law-abiding citizens in West Virginia also be able to protect yourselves and exercise your Second Amendment rights?’
I think the worst thing we can do is try to infringe on the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens by passing any more kind of gun control laws. We should enforce the existing laws. 
Please see full link to my full video on this legislation and what I’m doing in Congress to protect your right to keep and bear arms here. 
  
 
House Democrats recently passed radical legislation that would infringe on Americans’ constitutional right to keep and bear arms. Law-abiding citizens should be able to protect themselves and exercise their Second Amendment rights. We must defend the Second Amendment.  
President Biden, at a recent press conference on gun control, declared: “No amendment to the Constitution is absolute.” Unilaterally implementing gun control measures will make law-abiding Americans less free and less safe. Ignoring the Constitution, Biden is forcing lawful gun owners to comply with an oppressive, ideological agenda. West Virginia citizens must be able to protect their families.
  
U.S. National Debt 
 
We need to be judicious with our dollars. Today we have $28 trillion in national debt. That is more than $84,000 of debt per American citizen. I recently spoke on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives on national debt concerns. I urged my colleagues to consider the future. Please see full link to this video here.

CONGRESSWOMAN MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR'S WEEKLY UPDATE

This week, I participated in my very first Committee hearings on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the House Committee on Small Business. 

On the Foreign Affairs Committee, I opposed the slashing of the Western Hemisphere subcommittee. Did you know that Miami's largest trading partners are ALL in the Western Hemisphere? Brazil, Colombia, Canada, Mexico, and Chile. This is offensive to our community. In fact, The Miami Herald published an article about this deeply disturbing move to cut this subcommittee in half. 

I will always fight tirelessly for our American values of freedom, democracy, and respect for Human Rights. Pursue sanctions against the brutal regimes in Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua and strengthen our relationships with our allies and regional partners like Israel, Colombia, and Taiwan. 

On the Small Business Committee, I was selected to serve as the Ranking Member on the Subcommittee on Contracting & Infrastructure. In this role, I'll have the opportunity to guide our community through the burdensome federal government procurement process. I am absolutely committed to working in a bipartisan fashion to assist our struggling small business owners and deliver COVID-19 relief as soon as possible. From Flagler St to Calle Ocho and from Collins Avenue to Miracle Mile, our small businesses have been seriously impacted by the pandemic and I will never stop fighting for our local job creators. 


I look forward to continue addressing your cases, reading your letters, and responding to your comments on Social Media. Please continue to let me know what your thoughts are and never hesitate to reach out to my office. My team is more than happy to assist you with any of your concerns and guide you through any challenges you may have with our federal agencies. 

It is truly the honor of a lifetime to fight for YOU in the halls of Congress.

I WAS SELECTED AS THE RANKING MEMBER ON THE SUBCOMITTEE ON CONTRACTING & INFRASTRUCTURE


Honored to share with you all that I was selected by my colleagues to serve as the Ranking Member on the House Small Business Subcommittee on Contracting & Infrastructure! 

I will fight tirelessly so that our local job creators can access our federal procurement programs!

I SPOKE TO TELEMUNDO's NATIONAL NETWORK


Always great to speak to my friend and colleague, Cristina Londoño, with whom I worked with at several national television stations during my days as a journalist. Always great to share my priorities with Telemundo's audience and our many Spanish-speaking constituents in our district. 

I VOTED FOR THE NATIONAL APPRENTICESHIP ACT 


I helped to expand the National Apprenticeship Program and help get Americans Back to work. 

I voted for this legislation because it focuses on increasing access to education and skills training, promoting entrepreneurship, and strengthening infrastructure. 

This bill will invest over $3.5 billion to provide nearly one million new apprenticeship opportunities and update the original National Apprenticeship Act to meet twenty-first century standards. 

This will assist our efforts to get South Floridians back to work

CDC says masks no longer needed for those who are fully vaccinated
Yesterday, the CDC announced that fully vaccinated Americans no longer need to wear masks or practice social distancing. The new guidance says this includes certain situations when people are indoors or in large groups. Citing growing evidence, the CDC says that the vaccines offer significant protection against even more contagious variants. However, those who are unvaccinated remain at risk to themselves and others so they must continue wearing masks. The decision also was based on the declining number of new cases and that breakthrough infection in fully vaccinated people is extremely rare. Officials also said that the guidance could change again if conditions worsen. About 35% of Americans, nearly 118 million people, are fully vaccinated. The CDC has been criticized for being too cautious in its previous guidelines. 
Nashville lifts COVID-19 restrictions beginning today 
With more than 40 percent of residents of Davidson County with one does of a vaccine and falling rates of new cases, Nashville lifted all COVID-19 restriction on businesses and gathering beginning today. However, the mask mandate remains in place for all indoors spaces and for large outdoor gathering. The decision, based on CDC guidance, ends all capacity restrictions on bars, restaurants, music venues, sporting events and other businesses. Some businesses, like hair and nail salons, will be required to keep customers distanced in waiting areas. All businesses will be allowed to implement their own restrictions if they choose. 
Confirmed COVID-19 cases, deaths, vaccinations in Tennessee 
Yesterday, the Tennessee Department of Health reported 841 new cases, bringing the total to more than 856,428 confirmed cases. Nine people died yesterday and now more than 12,305 people have died and approximately 719 people are currently hospitalized with the virus statewide. There have been more than 7.8 million tests completed with a 4.85% positivity rate. As of today in Davidson County, there have been 98,711 (39 new) confirmed cases and 914 deaths.  
As of Thursday, 4,488,573 vaccinations have been administered in Tennessee - about 37% of all Tennesseans have received their first dose and 31% are fully vaccinated. The state is far below the national rate: 47% of all Americans have received one dose and 36% are fully vaccinated.  
The federal government has delivered nearly 339 million doses of vaccine and 266 million shots have been given nationwide.  
Go to Vaccines.gov or text your zip code to GETVAX (for English) or VACUNA (for Spanish) to find available vaccines at a location near you. 

Biden signs Executive Order tightening cybersecurity for the federal government  
President Biden signed an executive order Wednesday designed to strengthen cybersecurity for the federal government. The order does not specifically address oil and gas pipeline infrastructure, but directs the Department of Commerce to develop strict cybersecurity standards for companies that sell software services to the government. The move follows the cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline and is part of an effort to encourage private companies to develop tighter standards or risk losing federal contracts. Since becoming President, Biden has been forced to respond to cyberattacks by Russia on nine federal agencies and nearly 100 American companies, as well as China hacking thousands of small businesses through email servers. He has not ruled out counterattacks on Russia in retaliation for the attack.  
+Jim said, “Everyone and everything on the internet are vulnerable to attack like the Colonial Pipeline extortion, and worse. @POTUS’ latest executive order will help stem those attacks but this is going to be a long, hard-fought war against the criminal rings—many state-sponsored—that are trying to turn our own technology against us.” 

Arrests increase slightly at southern border; fewer unaccompanied minors arrive; and ICE deportations at record low 
In April, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) arrested the highest number of individuals entering the country illegally in the past twenty years. At the same time, the number of families and unaccompanied minors entering the country illegally declined. Nearly 179,000 people were arrested or detained, with nearly 63 percent of them being deported. The number of family groups detained dropped by 10 percent compared to March, while the number of unaccompanied minors fell by twelve percent, despite projection by CBP officials that numbers would increase. Meanwhile, deportations by ICE are at a record low, in part a result of the Biden administration’s focus on border and port security rather than targeting undocumented immigrants already in the U.S. Administration officials attribute the leveling off of illegal crossing of the border to tighter enforcement by the Mexican military and police, stemming the flow of immigrants fleeing violence in Central America through the country.   

  
Southeast experiencing wide spread gas shortages 
Despite President Biden’s call for calm, panic-buying has resulted in gas shortages and price increases across the Southeast following the cyberattack on the Colonial Pipeline by Russian hacker, DarkSide. More than 10,000 gas stations across the region have reported running out of fuel. The Governors in Florida, North Carolina, Georgia, and Virginia have declared states of emergency, as 28 percent of stations in North Carolina, and 17 percent in Georgia and Virginia, have run completely out of gas. In Tennessee, about 16 percent of stations are without gas. Major cities in those states have been hit especially hard with between 60 and 70 percent of stations with no gas. Efforts to increase transportation of fuel are being hampered by shortages of trained and qualified truck drivers. The Colonial Pipeline has already restarted operations and is expected to be fully operational by the weekend. 
 

Lee ends federal unemployment supplement
Governor Lee has withdrawn Tennessee from the federal pandemic unemployment supplement funding program. The expanded benefits will end on July 3rd. The program provides an extra $300 per week in unemployment benefits added to the state payment of a maximum of $275 per week. Republicans in the state argue that the supplemental funding allows unemployed Tennesseans to stay home rather than return to work. Tennessee provides one of the lowest unemployment benefits in the country. Last week, Republicans in the General Assembly pushed through legislation cutting the number of weeks people are eligible to receive unemployment benefits from 26 weeks to 12 weeks, making it the shortest period to receive benefits in the country. Tennessee joins a growing list of Republican led states, including Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, Arkansas, and Montana, to withdraw from the program. 
+Jim said, “Why would Gov. Lee take $300 a week from unemployed Tennesseans? To force them to go back to work, even if they are sick, they have no child care, or there are no jobs for them? I voted to give Tennesseans this help during the pandemic, but Gov. Lee is taking it away. Is that how he would want to be treated? Is he obeying the Golden Rule? What would Jesus do?” 

 
Israel expands offensive against Gaza 
Using artillery, tanks, and warplanes, Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) have escalated attacks against Hamas militants in Gaza. They have also called up at least three brigades of troops in preparation for a possible ground invasion. Gaza City has been bombarded by airstrikes over the past four nights, in an attempt to destroy a series of tunnels Hama uses to move around undetected by the IDF. The intensified strikes by Israel are in response to hundreds of rockets launched by Hama militants in Gaza, striking cities across Israel including Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. Unrest has spread in cities across Israel as Arab Israelis and right-wing Jewish Israelis confront each other. The attacks have left at least 122 Palestinians dead, including 31 children, and more than 900 people wounded. The attacks began after Israeli police clashed with Palestinians near Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem last week during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. 
+Jim said, “One of my most important jobs in Congress has been to help Israel with its defenses against missile attack. Iron Dome, Arrow, and David’s Sling are the best in the world but 1,700 launches from Gaza alone are too much for any system to handle. Hamas must stop these launches now. Both sides must return to peaceful co-existence.” 
Tennessee Holler Fest 
Jim will participate in the Tennessee Holler Fest tomorrow. You can join live on Twitter, Facebook, or YouTube to hear Tennesseans talk about issues facing the state.

Hoosiers,
 
After a year of shutdowns, Americans across the country are eager to see our country reopened and safely return to a state of normality. I've spoken with many Hoosiers around the District whose families and businesses have been directly impacted by COVID-19 but, through it all, have shown determination and resolve to conquer this virus as America has conquered the challenges we’ve faced in the past. I'm hearing loud and clear the voices of those who are ready to get our kids back in school and fully reopen businesses, and I’m working alongside them to restore our way of life.
 
Be of good cheer,
 


  

 

 

 
I recently visited Corydon Cinemas in Harrison County and learned about how COVID restrictions have decimated this second-generation family-owned business. Congress’ COVID relief should be focused on fighting the virus itself so Hoosiers feel safe returning to work and play at local businesses, like Corydon Cinemas, whose sales are down an astonishing almost 90% over the past year.
 

 
I stopped by the 1819 General Store in Elizabeth and had the chance to talk with store owner, Kathy Hensley, and County Councilman Brad Wiseman. We discussed the store’s role as a focal point in the community and their experience staying involved in community activity through COVID-19.
 

 

 
Locally-owned small businesses like J&B Magic Shop and The Elderberry Company in New Albany, which I visited last month, are the backbones of our communities. Many small businesses, which employ about half of private sector employees across the country, like these have found innovative ways to continue serving their customers throughout the pandemic, such as adapting to new safety standards and shifting toward online sales.
 

 
Last week, I visited Klaiber’s Sewing Center in Bloomington and had the pleasure of meeting with owners Glen and Rose Hilderbrand to discuss the work they do at their family-owned business. As COVID-19 shutdowns resulted in an uptick of at-home hobbies over the last year, Klaiber’s Sewing Center had incredible growth as one of the only repair places for sewing machines in District. 
 

 
More and more Americans are registering and receiving their COVID-19 vaccines everyday thanks to the hard work of health care professionals at facilities such as the Windrose Health Network vaccination clinic in Edinburgh. Last week, I visited the clinic where I spoke with several employees and talked about the great work they’re doing administering upwards of 500 doses a week.
 

 
Brave Hoosier law enforcement officers spend their lives keeping our communities safe and working tirelessly to defend and uphold the law. The new ISP hangar at Greenwood Airport will help these heroes continue to protect our loved ones, neighbors, and great state. 
 
I recently wrote an op-ed calling out politicians in Washington for failing to adequately work across the aisle and with officers on law enforcement reform.
 

 
Term Limits- My top priority is ensuring that Hoosiers and all Americans have representatives that first and foremost prioritize the needs of their constituents. For far too long, Washington has strayed from answering the will of the people and instead opts for self-promotion and personal glory.
 
That is why my first act in the 117th Congress was reintroducing a term limits Constitutional amendment, limiting the number of terms Members of Congress can serve in office. 
 
Workforce Development- Recently, I reintroduced the Developing Responsible Individuals for a Vibrant Economy (DRIVE-Safe) Act, which addresses the driver shortage in America and creates more career opportunities for hard-working Hoosiers to get involved in a growing, 21st-century economy. Now more than ever, we should be bolstering our workforce and empowering Americans to get back to work.
 

 
The 2021 Congressional Art Competition is here! This year’s theme is “Crossroads of America”. All high school students in IN09 are invited to submit their original pieces for a chance to have it displayed in the U.S. Capitol for the next year. 
 
All artwork must be digitally submitted by April 30, 2021. For more information on how to get involved, please visit the congressional website!

Fighting For The Emergency Aid New Yorkers Deserve
 
 Dear Neighbor,  Before Thanksgiving, I had indicated we were working around the clock on a new COVID-19 stimulus package. On Tuesday, my colleagues and I in the Problem Solvers Caucus, as well as a bipartisan group of Senators, unveiled an $908 billion emergency relief proposal.  
 The proposal immediately generated significant support from Republican and Democrat leaders across Washington, and we are now closer to a deal than we’ve been in months.  While many folks in D.C. gave up, we in the Problem Solvers Caucus have refused to take no for an answer. The fact is for far too long, Congress has failed to do its job and deliver relief – and New Yorkers are suffering because of that failure. 
 
We don’t have time for more partisan bickering – we’ve got to help New York’s working families, small businesses, local governments, critical health care providers and school districts. This framework does just that.  It’s also important to note passing this emergency relief package is critical to best positioning the country for an effective rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine, which is rapidly approaching.  
 We must listen to the needs of the American people and deliver economic relief to the millions of folks who need it. We will not let you down.  
 
Until Next Time,  Tom

12/28/20 20:32,District Update: Securing COVID-19 Relief for Arkansas Families,"COVID-19 Update | December 28, 2020
View Email in Browser 
 
Dear Friend,
Last Monday, the House of Representatives and the Senate came together and passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act. On Sunday, President Trump signed this bill into law.
This legislation includes a COVID-19 relief package, as well as a separate bill to fund the government. 
This long-awaited targeted COVID-19 package is the result of a bipartisan effort by my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to provide the workers, small businesses, families, and people of Arkansas with much-needed relief.
The annual FY2021 bill serves to fund critical government projects and programs. More specifically, this provides yearlong funding for infrastructure, education, national security and defense, and many other crucial government projects and programs.
The COVID-19 element of the bill extends the Paycheck Protection Program, provides unemployment relief, issues Economic Impact Payments, and serves to bolster the economy and direct aid to our families, small businesses, and hard-working Americans.
On Saturday, I spoke with Fox News' Alicia Acuna about why I supported this bipartisan legislation and how it will give the American people and the American economy much-needed support during these difficult times. 


In response to the challenges created by COVID-19, this legislation specifically will:
Bolster the Economy:
	•	$325 billion for small businesses, including $284 billion for first and second forgivable PPP loans, dedicated set-asides for very small businesses and lending through community-based lenders like Community Development Financial Institutions and Minority Depository Institutions, and expanded PPP eligibility for 501(c)(6) nonprofits, including destination marketing organizations, and local newspapers, TV and radio broadcasters.
	•	$20 billion for new EIDL Grants for businesses in low-income communities.
	•	$15 billion in funding for entertainment venues, movie theaters, and museums that are experiencing significant revenue loss.
	•	Expands list of eligible expenses to include covered operations; property damage costs that are not covered by insurance; covered supplier costs; and covered worker protection expenditures (PPE). PPP borrowers will be allowed to take tax deductions for covered business expenses.
	•	$13 billion to support farmers and the agriculture sector, including assistance under the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) and funding directed to programs that support local producers and new and beginning farmers.
Support Working Families:

ANNUAL UPS DELIVERY RIDE ALONG

Every year, I am always delighted to join my good friend Chris Schaffhauser and United Parcel Service (UPS) during the holidays.
I always enjoy riding around and delivering packages with their team. This year, we went through the Riverdale area and spoke to a few small business owners and employees along the way. It was a treat getting to talked with my friends in the area while making deliveries. 
I appreciate all the hard work the men and women of UPS do, especially when it comes to the holiday season!




MEETING WITH THE CONWAY AREA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE

 Last Tuesday, I had the opportunity to participate in a call hosted by Mr. Jamie Gates, Executive Vice President of the Conway Area Chamber of Commerce.
This call, which featured 43 attendees, including business owners, elected officials, bankers, and educators, was an excellent way to inform the community about the COVID-19 relief legislation which passed through the House last Monday.
I spoke on the much-needed relief which would be provided to small businesses through an extension of the Paycheck Protection Program, Economic Impact Payments for Arkansans and their families, and critical aid for those unemployed in the area throughout the state.
It was a pleasure participating in this call with a fantastic group of individuals from all across the Conway Area. I am grateful I was able to share some of the key components of upcoming relief with this Chamber.    


TAKING ACTION TO PREVENT VETERAN SUICIDE

 Sadly, every 14 hours, someone in Arkansas dies by suicide. Every 84 minutes, somewhere in the United States, a veteran commits suicide – 17 losses per day. We lose more than 6,000 veterans every year due to suicide. 
These numbers are especially disheartening because they represent the men and women that have worked hard to serve our country. It is our duty to protect those who have selflessly served to protect the American people.
Last week, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced the completion of all 2020 priorities established under the President’s Roadmap to Empower Veterans and End a National Tragedy of Suicide (PREVENTS) to end suicide through robust community engagement and a connected research ecosystem tasked with preventing suicide among veterans and all Americans.
President Trump released the PREVENTS roadmap in June 2020, and to date, PREVENTS has accomplished all nine priorities for the year, including:
	◦	Launching REACH as a national public health campaign aimed at empowering all Americans to play a critical role in preventing suicide. 
	◦	Garnering signatures from 42 States and one U.S. Territory on a PREVENTS State Proclamation outlining agreed-upon practices and steps to engage their citizens in suicide prevention. 
	◦	Partnering with VA and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation’s Hiring Our Heroes to create a Wellbeing in the Workplace Pledge and Guide to encourage companies to prioritize the mental health and wellness of their employees.
I will continue to vote in favor of legislation that supports veteran mental health programs because one life lost to suicide is one too many, and my office stands at the ready to assist in any way that we can; please call us at (501) 324-5941. 
Help is available 24/7 through the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255.

Sincerely,
 
Representative French Hill

1/22/21 16:27,Newsletter: A New President,"Message from the Representative

Dear Community Members of NY-14,

It’s difficult to put into words all that we have endured over the last few weeks and, really, the last fews years. So, I will borrow from Amanda Gorman’s beautiful poem on the Capitol steps: 

“Somehow we weathered and witnessed
A nation that isn't broken
but simply unfinished
There is always light
if only we're brave enough to see it
if only we're brave enough to be it.”

On Wednesday, we finally welcomed President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to the White House.   Now, we must begin creating justice, healing our planet, and improving the material conditions for all people. The work is on all of us to organize and build a better future.

That work began on Wednesday with several executive orders from President Biden.  These orders ended the Muslim ban, revoked the Keystone XL pipeline permit, stopped border wall construction, restored protections for Dreamers, reversed the order excluding undocumented people from the Census, and more. The President will also send Congress a bill that would overhaul the path to citizenship for undocumented people in the United States - making it far more accessible.   

Additionally, the President has made clear that COVID-19 relief is a top priority, and recently released a legislative package that would provide $1,400 stimulus checks, among other measures. I believe that Democrats have a mandate to do as much as we can, for as many people as we can, as quickly as we can - and I plan to push to ensure the next COVID relief package does just that. This country elected Democrats to lead the House, the Senate and the White House. Voters endorsed our campaign promises of paid sick leave, $2k stimulus checks and retroactive unemployment. And, we have a narrow window of time in which to deliver on those promises. People are on the brink of eviction now and it would be a mistake to waste time watering down a COVID relief bill in a futile attempt to assuage Republicans when this country elected Democrats.

The other top priority on Congress’ agenda is impeachment. Last week, the House voted to impeach President Trump for the second time on the charge of “incitement of insurrection.”  The matter now goes to the Senate, which will host a trial to determine whether or not to convict the former president. Seventeen Republican Senators would need to join Senate Democrats to convict him. Only a simple majority would then be required to ban President Trump for running for future office. 

It has been a tumultuous few weeks, to say the least, and, on a personal note, I want to say how touched I was by the kind words and well wishes I’ve received from people in the district and across the country in the wake of the Capitol attacks. The January 6 insurrection is not a moment from which we can or should easily ‘move on,’ but it is a moment that can make our nation stronger if we choose to act with urgency and accountability.  There can be no unity without real accountability both for President Trump and his enablers in the House, Senate and elsewhere. In last Friday’s town hall, I talked more about what this accountability could look like. You can see below for a recap.  

As always, please do not hesitate to contact our office if we can be of any assistance. You can reach us by sending a message HERE or by calling 718-662-5970. We are also regularly sharing resources and information at our @RepAOC Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts.  

In service,


Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez



FAQs from January’s Town Hall
 On Friday, January 15, we held an emergency town hall meeting to discuss Congress’ response to the attack on the Capitol. You can see the full town hall, in English and in Spanish, on our YouTube page. We’ve also included some frequently asked questions and answers below.  

What is being done to hold responsible Members of the House and Senate who supported explicitly or implicitly the riot at the Capitol? 
Speaker Pelosi said that “if in fact it is found that members of Congress were accomplices to this insurrection, if they aided and abetted the crime, there may have to be actions taken beyond the Congress in terms of prosecutions.”  I fully support using the 14th Amendment to prosecute and expel Members of the House or Senate who invited insurrection against the United States, and I have co-signed Rep. Cori Bush’s resolution to do just that.

What is being done to investigate the weak response from law enforcement to the Capitol attacks? 
Both the Capitol Police Chief and the Sergeant at Arms have resigned in the wake of the attack. There is talk among leadership of both parties about forming a 9/11-style commission to investigate the failings of the Capitol Police and other law enforcement. I am also co-sponsoring Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s COUP Act to investigate ties between white supremacists and Capitol Police, and I’ve joined Rep. Rashida Tlaib’s letter calling for an inquiry into National Guard response. 

How can we communicate with the many people who believe in conspiracy theories but who weren't a part of the attack? What do we do about the persistent issue of white supremacy groups and organizations? 
It is possible to deradicalize white supremacists. One successful model is Life After Hate.  They testified to their work before Congress last year. You can see a clip of their testimony here.  Congress must fund more programs like this. 

Where can I make an appointment for the COVID-19 vaccine and access the most up to date information? 
You can visit the City’s website for the latest information on the COVID-19 vaccine. Once eligible, you will be able to make a vaccine appointment at many locations throughout the city using the NYC Vaccine Finder or by calling 1-877-VAX-4NYC. We are aware that this week many appointments had to be rescheduled due to a shortage of the vaccine. This shortfall is due to President Trump’s abhorrent mismanagement of this crisis. President Biden had pledged to dramatically increase production of the vaccine in his first 100 days in office.

12/5/20 6:00,Coming together to restore our economy & protect the American people,"SENATE LEADERSHIP MUST JOIN US TO DELIVER THE RESCUE AMERICA NEEDS






December 5, 2020

Dear Friends,
We have now lost more than 270,000 Americans to COVID-19. Tens of millions of Americans remain unemployed. Millions have fallen into poverty and millions more are facing housing and food insecurity for the first time.
As this crisis rages on, with daily new cases over 180,000 and climbing, our focus must be on delivering an immediate and urgent rescue to stop this virus and put us on a path to reversing its devastating economic impacts.
Twice now, my colleagues and I in the House have passed legislation to get the job done and provide needed relief for people. We passed our Heroes Act in May, more than six months ago. In October we agreed to meet Senate Republicans halfway with a compromise bill. Rather than coming to the negotiating table, the Senate moved backwards, pushing an even smaller ‘skinny bill’ that would have left millions of Americans hungry, homeless or otherwise without a lifeline in the face of historic hardship. Now more than ever, providing that lifeline for Americans is vital.
Without a rescue package advanced by the end of December: 
	•	An estimated 12 million Americans will lose their unemployment benefits.
	•	Student loan relief that allows borrowers to defer payments during the crisis will end.
	•	National eviction moratoriums will run out, allowing millions of families to be forced from their homes.
Even with the current level of federal support, millions more Americans, many of them children, are experiencing hunger and food insecurity for the first time. Food banks have been working day in and day out to meet this growing need, but as demand continues to rise with no federal relief in sight, more and more of our friends and neighbors will go hungry.
Without a federal rescue, state and local governments that have already cut themselves to the bone to support their communities will be forced to lay off firefighters, police officers, emergency responders, health care workers, teachers and other essential workers that have been keeping our nation going through this crisis. Congress needs to back these folks, or we risk losing the most essential public services we have at the worst possible time. 
President-elect Joe Biden called for an immediate federal response this week while also accepting that more work will need to be done. He said, in part, “Right now, the full Congress should come together and pass a robust package for relief to address these urgent needs. But any package passed in a lame-duck session is likely to be, at best, just a start.”
The stakes for our nation and our people could not be higher, and the need for action could not be more urgent.
I was encouraged by signs this week that Members on both sides of the aisle are coming forth with alternative COVID-19 proposals. I am reviewing these proposals as they come out, and I remain hopeful that my Republican colleagues in both chambers will see reason before the year is out and agree to a meaningful and sensible rescue.
As we look to the end of this crisis with the emergence of the first approved vaccines, we must also prepare ourselves for a hard winter. We must commit ourselves to doing the real work of protecting ourselves, our families and our communities. Wear a mask for others and show your strength and love of those around you. Together, I know we can make it through. 







As always, thank you for reading.

Your friend,

 Thought of the day: “Kindness is spreading sunshine into other people’s lives regardless of the weather.”
Coronavirus Update

On Thursday, Michigan reported 1,284 new cases of COVID-19 and 75 new deaths, bringing the state’s total cases to 572,179 and deaths to 15,052. Michigan’s case counts continue to trend in a hopeful direction as health care professionals work hard to vaccinate Americans. Michigan’s current positivity rate is 5.7% and has been on the decline for 20 consecutive days. Efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID are working, and we must continue to strictly follow CDC guidelines by wearing our masks (two is better than one, according to the CDC), keeping our physical distance, and washing our hands.
Michiganders must remain vigilant, with cases of the more transmissible UK COVID variant increasing in the state, including in both Washtenaw and Wayne counties. We have the tools we need to slow the spread and reduce the appearance of variants, including masking, keeping our distance, washing our hands, and getting vaccinated when eligible. Together, we will put this virus behind us and prevent more deaths, but we have to stay focused and committed.
On Monday, Michigan reported 2,043,650 COVID vaccines have been distributed and, of that, 1,446,322 vaccines have been administered. Approximately 11% of Michigan’s population has received at least one dose of the vaccine, with that number expected to increase quickly as the Biden Administration works to increase the number of vaccines distributed across the country. Michigan continues to prioritize vaccines for those 65 and older, front-line workers, some state and federal workers, jail and prison staff, Pre-K through 12th-grade teachers, and childcare providers.
Yesterday, President Biden announced that he has secured an agreement with vaccine manufacturers Moderna and Pfizer to deliver 200 million additional doses of the life-saving COVID vaccines, bringing the U.S. total to 600 million doses by the end of July—enough to vaccinate 300 million Americans. This agreement puts the U.S. on track to exceed President Biden’s original goal of administering 100 million vaccine doses in his first 100 days. After the Biden Administration inherited a disorganized and chaotic response to the ongoing pandemic, I applaud President Biden and the health experts he has empowered to lead our nation’s response with solutions based in science.
Yesterday, my House Energy and Commerce Committee held a meeting to work on President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, starting early in the morning and going late into the evening with more work to be done. We are working hard to ensure the next COVID relief package is bold and expansive to meet the needs of Americans struggling due to the ongoing pandemic and aim to have consideration of the package done before jobless programs lapse next month.
Economists agree that the next COVID relief package must be bold, expansive, and passed with urgency to meet the severity of this moment. Without the President’s American Rescue Plan, we could end up with 4 million fewer jobs this year and a slower return to pre-pandemic employment. Millions of parents, particularly mothers, may be forced to stay home, reducing their wages or forcing them to leave the workforce.

 Legislative Update
This week in Congress, I have been focused on speeding aid to struggling families and small businesses throughout Michigan. 9 House committees of jurisdiction, including my House Energy and Commerce Committee, have met this week to work on the American Rescue Plan and begin advancing key components of the package. We are dedicated to speeding assistance to Americans and confronting this pandemic with bold, science-based solutions, including rapidly expanding COVID vaccinations. It’s critical we get vaccines into the arms of as many Americans as possible, as quickly as possible, so we can crush COVID and build back a more equitable and just economy.

4/5/21 16:31,Helping Our Veterans Get Through This Pandemic,"Dear Friend, 

This pandemic has been hard on all of us. From teachers and students adapting to remote classrooms, to frontline health workers doing all they can to treat our communities under very difficult circumstances, and business owners struggling to stay afloat and pay their workers, communities throughout our state have all faced unique challenges over the past year. That includes our veterans, many of whom were already facing unacceptable obstacles -- whether transitioning back home from recent deployment overseas, or trying to access benefits that were earned decades ago. 

That’s why I’m pleased to share that the American Rescue Plan, which I helped pass into law last month, includes urgently needed resources to help veterans weather this storm. Those resources and provisions include: 

	•	$386 million for up to 17,250 eligible veterans who are unemployed due to COVID-19 to receive up to 12 months of retraining assistance for high-demand occupations. (This retraining assistance also provides a housing stipend and does not count against other educational benefits previously entitled to veterans.)
	•	$7.25 billion nationwide for additional first- and second-round Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans to eligible veteran-owned small businesses until the program expires on March 31, 2021.
	•	$276 million for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on the benefits claims and appeals backlogs.
	•	$13.5 billion for the Veterans Health Administration to provide healthcare services and related support to eligible veterans, including to cover the impacts of pandemic-related delays in necessary care and to extend CARES Act service expansions in the areas of suicide prevention, women’s health, VA homelessness programs, and telehealth.
	•	$100 million in funding for investments in information technology systems to support the acceleration of the VA’s supply chain modernization efforts.
	•	$500 for VA construction of State Veterans Homes (SVHs) and $250 million in one-time emergency federal payments to help these state-operated facilities provide enhanced treatment and staffing expansions, as well as boost the distribution of personal protective equipment.
	•	Allows the VA to waive up to $2 billion worth of copays that would otherwise be charged to veterans for VA healthcare services from April 6, 2020 through September 30, 2021.
In addition, I want to make sure you know that with the passage of the SAVE LIVES Act, the VA can now offer vaccines to all veterans -- even those not enrolled in VA health care -- as well as to their spouses and caregivers. That means our local VA medical centers will be receiving additional vaccine doses in the coming weeks. If you’re a veteran, spouse, or caregiver, you should contact your local VA medical center to schedule your appointment. 

For more information about resources and steps taken by Congress to support our veterans during the pandemic, check out my website. And I’ll be sure to keep you updated about steps you or a loved one who has served in our armed forces can take to access benefits and services as applications and portals become available. 

Throughout their service, each of our veterans has made countless sacrifices in order to protect us and the values we cherish. It’s up to us to make sure they receive the resources and assistance they need to thrive, and I’m going to keep doing all that I can to make sure we deliver on that sacred responsibility. 

All my best, 
Jeff

Foxx Report
 
As we steadily approach the end of 2020, there is a question on everyone’s mind that has yet to be answered: when will relief be on its way? Even as that question is being asked, it’s as if Washington Democrats have put on their blinders and plugged up their ears to the demands of the American people. Just last week, the House held votes on a smattering of bills that are entirely unrelated to providing targeted relief to families, small businesses, and frontline workers. There is a time and place for robust debate on different pieces of legislation, but there’s a bigger priority that’s before Congress right now. We’re in the middle of a global pandemic, and Americans are hurting. The top action item on Congress’ agenda must be delivering for the American people. They’re counting on Congress to act, but House Democrats would rather shepherd through their own messaging bills instead of engaging in substantive, bipartisan collaboration with their Republican colleagues.
It’s even more damning that Speaker Pelosi openly admitted in her press conference last week that she purposely stonewalled relief negotiations for months so that her hyper-partisan priorities would be enmeshed within any relief package put before Congress. This admission by her is repugnant, and it sends a message to the American people that their livelihoods are bargaining chips rather than a core component to the well-being of their families. This is not an example of good governance, and it’s time that we get on the right track. We have work to do, and I’ll keep up the fight against these abhorrent delays that are corroding the work of the People’s House and putting livelihoods in jeopardy.
A Voter-ID Victory For North Carolina
On Wednesday, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit unanimously overturned a lower court decision that formally struck down North Carolina’s voter ID law. The ill-conceived reasonings of Loretta Biggs, the U.S. District judge who had struck down the law, were totally refuted by this bi-partisan Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. It’s particularly telling that one judge on that Fourth Circuit panel, who voted to overturn her ruling, is an Obama appointee.
I have long held the position that activist judges are a stain on the judicial process that exists in this country. They let their subjectivity overhaul their duty to fairly assess cases that are brought before them, and they do so out of a blatant disregard for the rule of law. There is no doubt that Loretta Biggs is the epitome of an activist judge, and it’s good to see that her spurious efforts to thwart a commonsense law that protects election integrity were foiled. Interpretation of the law is based on objectivity and precedent, not political persuasions or grievances one holds.
Millions of North Carolinians supported the addition of this voter ID amendment to the state's Constitution back in 2018, and with the recent Fourth Circuit Appeals court ruling, their will has been respected. Without question, this is encouraging news. I’m particularly proud to see that the basic principle of self-governance under the rule of law has not gone unheeded. 
The Newest COVID-19 Vaccine Scam
With new developments of promising vaccine candidates being relayed through the national media, there’s much anticipation about when they will become approved and readily available. But amidst that promising news, there’s a looming threat that needs to be addressed immediately: a new wave of scams is steadily approaching on the horizon. I’ve spoken about the covert efforts of scammers many times this year, but this time, the ramifications are particularly worrisome. Allow me to give you some more information.
The Department of Homeland Security is working alongside private sector companies to prepare for incoming vaccine scams. This year alone, fake personal protective equipment (PPE) sales, elaborate extortion schemes, and false cures have defrauded countless Americans. You deserve a heads-up on what to expect, and I’m more than happy to provide you with the information you need to know:
	•	Do not trust online advertisements highlighting readily available vaccines for sale.
	•	Always consult a licensed medical professional to obtain a treatment or COVID-19 vaccine.
	•	Do not answer phone calls, emails or text messages that offer vaccines or treatments.
	•	And, be cautious of social media advertisements that claim to provide free vaccines to the general public.
If you see anything suspicious online, you can always report it to: covid19investigations@dhs.gov. Stay vigilant, and make sure you’re always informed.  Recent Events

2/14/21 21:20,Honoring Local Heroes,"Dear Friends,  
Tax filing season began on the 12th. As I mentioned in last week's update, Ohioans should file electronically, if possible, as the IRS is still working through a backlog of paper returns filed last year. It's also important to keep your eyes out for signs of tax fraud, particularly regarding unemployment insurance benefits. If you receive a 1099-G tax form from the state for benefits that you did not apply for, you may be the victim of identity theft and can file a report here. The IRS has provided information to help protect yourself from identity theft and unemployment insurance fraud, which you can view here.
 
I am actively working with the State of Ohio and the IRS to help Americans who may find themselves the victim of unemployment insurance fraud. Read more about the four actions I am requesting the IRS take to help taxpayers.
 
This past week, House committees met to consider portions of the forthcoming COVID-19 relief package. In the Ways & Means Committee, Democrats rejected amendments that would have helped get Americans back to work, protect against fraud, and assist parents. Unlike the four previous relief bills that were done in a bipartisan fashion, this bill is being pushed through by one party. I joined Neil Cavuto to discuss the proposal and the process on Friday. You can watch my interview here.
 
On the vaccine front, Ohioans 65 years of age or older, employees of K-12 schools that will remain or return to in-person learning, and individuals with severe congenital or development disorders are eligible to receive the vaccine, per state guidance. You can find more information here.
 
In your service,
Brad

4/30/21 10:20,NEWS YOU CAN USE: Help is Here!,"News from Representative Bourdeaux 

Dear Lindsey,  This month, I’ve been crisscrossing our District, talking about how the American Rescue Plan (ARP) is being put to work: shots are going into arms, money into pockets, and families and communities are getting the support they need to weather this moment. Since the law was enacted in March, over 150 million Americans have received stimulus checks, vaccine distribution has skyrocketed, and our struggling small businesses are getting the financial assistance they need to survive.  
SHOTS IN ARMS 

Recently, I visited the mass vaccination site at Lanier Technical College in Forsyth County. Georgia has continued to be one of the lowest-ranked states for vaccine distribution, but sites like this are helping to close the gap and protect our citizens.   The American Rescue Plan provides more than $70 billion to expand national COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, vaccine distribution, and boosting domestic production of personal protective equipment (PPE).   Health centers in Georgia, including the Center for Pan Asian Community Services’ Cosmo Health Center and the Good Samaritan Health Center are also set to receive funding from the American Rescue Plan. I’m proud to say that the Georgia Highlands Medical Service got a grant for more than $5 million! 
SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESSES 

Small businesses have been struggling in the COVID-19 pandemic and I’m glad to say we were able to get them some help. My bipartisan PPP Extension Act was signed into law by President Biden earlier this month — and it all started with the Aurora Theatre in Lawrenceville!   I also got the chance to visit a few businesses recently, including Popbar Halcyon, Tam's Backstage, and Cherry Street Brewpub at Halcyon. When I visited EPA! Come Arepa!, we discussed the impact of COVID-19 on minority-owned businesses, which have been hit particularly hard and have received less relief. Hispanic applications for PPP loans, for example, have been approved at half of the rate of white-owned businesses.   The American Rescue Plan establishes a Community Navigator pilot program to address this issue and increase awareness and participation in COVID-19 relief programs for business owners currently lacking access, with priority for businesses owned by economically disadvantaged individuals, women, and veterans. 
THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN & GEORGIA 
State and Local Government Funding Relief: As part of the American Rescue Plan, Gwinnett County will be receiving $181.5 million and Forsyth County $47.3 million to help distribute vaccinations, to support small businesses, to help with rent and make critical long term investments in public health and mental health services.  Schools: The American Rescue Plan includes significant funding to support our schools, including money to help with safe reopenings and addressing learning loss that has occurred over the past year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Gwinnett County School District is estimated to receive $265 million, Forsyth County nearly $10 million, and Buford School District $3.4 million through the ARP.  Health Care: The American Rescue Plan also makes several changes designed to increase access to healthcare for Georgians. It gives Georgia a second chance to expand Medicaid — which would potentially cover half a million Georgians who currently do not have health care — and cuts the cost dramatically for Georgia to expand. It also helps families who purchase insurance on the exchange, by capping insurance premiums at 8.5%.  Support for Families with Children: Thanks to a provision contained in the American Rescue Plan providing an expansion of the Child Tax Credit, researchers estimate that child poverty in the United States will be cut in half. 
KEY RESOURCES 
If you are 16 or older, you are eligible for the vaccine! Schedule your appointment here.   The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is now accepting applications to help pay for funerals of those we’ve lost from COVID-19, including services that have already been held. FEMA will pay up to $9,000 in costs per funeral, or up to $35,000 per application. Click here to apply.  If you need more information on COVID-19, you can visit my COVID-19 resources page here.  As always, please don't hesitate to reach out if my office can be of assistance. 
Sincerely, 

Carolyn Bourdeaux Member of Congress

Dear Neighbor,
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted so many aspects of our lives here in California. We’ve missed birthdays, graduations, and quinceañeras. Thousands of our neighbors, family and friends have lost their lives. 
 
Over a year later, the light at the end of the tunnel is here. If we all get vaccinated, we CAN get back to living our lives again with minimal interruption. The COVID-19 vaccines are safe, effective and tested. If you have any questions -- or are struggling to find an appointment that works for you or a family member -- please reach out to my office. We are here to serve you.
 
This newsletter has updates on COVID-19 safety guidelines, vaccination clinics, financial relief programs from the American Rescue Plan, job opportunities, updates from Washington, D.C., and more.
  
 
COVID-19 Vaccine Updates & Information
 
  

  
The State of California is following the  CDC guidelines which say fully vaccinated individuals do not need to wear a mask in public unless they are in large crowds. However, it is important to remember that you should keep wearing a mask in those instances until you have been fully vaccinated. That means getting all doses of the vaccine and to keep wearing a mask for two weeks after the final dose.
 
California has now administered nearly 30 million vaccines and has the lowest positivity rate in the nation. LA County has administered over 7.8 million doses and 79.2% of all seniors are fully vaccinated, while 59.3% of all residents 16+ are fully vaccinated. As more people are vaccinated, coronavirus deaths are steadily declining.
 
COVID-19 vaccinations are free and available to everyone regardless of immigration status -- you will not be asked.
 
We are getting closer to defeating this virus every day. We can’t quit now! 
 
Vaccination events in our community
 
There are upcoming vaccination events in Wilmington, North Long Beach, and Huntington Park listed here. 
 
Many other sites, including local pharmacies and community centers, are hosting COVID-19 vaccines events. Check MyTurn.ca.gov or text your ZIP code to GETVAX (438829) to get a list of sites near you. You can also check my website’s regularly updated list of vaccination sites in our district.
 
COVID-19 Vaccinations for Homebound Residents
 
People who are homebound still should get vaccinated against COVID-19. LA County residents can call (833) 540-0473 for help with at-home vaccinations or transportation to vaccination sites. If you or someone you know in the City of Carson would like to get a vaccine but cannot leave their home, please call (310) 952-1750 to get on their interest list.
  


  
Virtual Vaccine Town Halls
  
Vaccine hesitancy is still an issue in many of our communities. Although nearly eight million vaccine doses have been administered in LA County, only 44 percent of eligible residents in our district have received at least one dose of a vaccine. 
 
If you have questions about whether the vaccine works and is safe, join the Children’s Institute for discussions with medical experts. If you’re not able to join either of these town halls, please contact your primary care provider or get in touch with a local community health center to have all of your questions answered.
 

 
Community Resources & Information
 
  
Thanks to everyone who joined my Telephone Town Hall on Wednesday. It is always great to hear from constituents. Missed it? Recordings and transcripts of the event will be posted here soon.

How to Support Migrant Children in Long Beach
 
The City of Long Beach has launched an online portal with detailed information on how the community can help support the migrant children who will be temporarily sheltered at the Long Beach Convention Center as part of the federal government’s humanitarian effort to support unaccompanied migrant children arriving at the southern borders. I had a chance to tour the facility on Thursday and am happy to see the migrant kids have access to legal support, medical assistance, and are being placed in a kid-friendly space while they are being connected with their families.
  

  
The Administration continues to work around the clock to get these kids out of Border Patrol custody, into a safe environment with wrap-around services, and placed as quickly as possible with a family member here in the U.S. Any situation where a child is not living with their family members is not ideal. We must continue to work hard to reunite these kids with family as quickly as possible.
 
Extension for Real ID 
 
The Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday postponed the Real ID deadline to May 3, 2023. Americans will have more time to get the Real ID cards which  will be required for boarding flights and entering federal facilities. More information here.
 
Community Events
  

 
AAPI Self-Defense Event in Carson, May 8th
 
The City of Carson is partnering with the Filipino Consul General and Assemblymember Mike Gipson to hold a self-defense workshop for seniors, led by the granddaughter of Bruce Lee, Diana Lee Inosanto. Come by Carson Park (21411 Orrick Ave) from 10:00 -11:30 AM on Saturday to attend this training.

Join Tree People and community members on May 8 and May 22 in planting large shade trees in city parkways so that the many benefits of trees are more available in our community. You can sign up here. 
 

  
 
Updates from D.C.
 
  

 We recognized 100 days of the Biden Administration recently, and so many improvements have happened over these first 100 days. All adults are now eligible for free COVID-19 vaccinations, we passed extra assistance for families, children, renters and small businesses, and proposals have been released to build America Back better than before. In short: help is here.
 
  
I introduced the Prompt Approval of Safe Generic Drugs Act (H.R. 2831) which would make it easier for the Food and Drug Administration to authorize generic drugs to bring them  to market. 
 
Last week, I led the Border Security, Facilitation, and Operations Subcommittee of the House Homeland Security Committee in a hearing focused on unaccompanied minors at the border. Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia joined us as a panelist and discussed the City of Long Beach’s humanitarian approach to welcoming and caring for migrant children crossing the border. As Congress works toward the next steps in reforming immigration policy, I remain committed to working to find solutions to support asylum seekers as they arrive, and to address the root causes of migration.
 The Energy and Commerce Committee’s Energy Subcommittee held a hearing on reducing carbon emissions from the transportation sector. I discussed creative ideas to improve electric vehicle access in low-income communities with Joe Britton of the Zero Emissions Transportation Association. You can watch the recording here.

COVID VACCINE

This week, we witnessed a historic milestone – the first doses of the COVID-19 vaccine administered here in Colorado and in the United States. I am tremendously excited by the authorization of a COVID-19 vaccine and am looking forward to taking the vaccine when it is available to me and recommended by my doctor. Because supply of the vaccine is limited and distribution will occur in phases, it is as important as ever to continue social distancing, wearing a mask, and washing your hands.  

The COVID-19 vaccine was required to meet the strict safety and efficacy standards required of all vaccines. The vaccine candidates submitted detailed data on safety and effectiveness which were reviewed by an independent, outside advisory board before being authorized by the career scientists at FDA. Although there is currently no evidence of serious safety concerns associated with the vaccine, all patients will continue to be monitored to ensure its long-term safety.

Because the initial supply of vaccines is very limited, vaccinations will be prioritized for high-risk health care workers and Coloradans most at risk for severe cases of COVID-19. Low-risk individuals and the general public should not expect to receive the vaccine until summer 2021. To get the facts on the COVID-19 vaccine and to see when and where you can expect to receive a vaccine, please visit CDPHE’s website at covid19.colorado.gov/vaccine or call the CO-HELP hotline at 303-389-1687.

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has also distributed the COVID-19 vaccine to 37 of its regional VA medical centers across the country, including the Rocky Mountain VA Medical Center in Aurora. Vaccinations at these sites will begin this week, prioritizing VA health care workers and Veterans residing in long-term care units. As more vaccines become available, the VA plans to offer free COVID-19 vaccines to all Veterans receiving VA health care who want one.

	•	Efforts to pack the Supreme Court

What I Saw at Our Southern Border
A few weeks ago, I traveled to the U.S / Mexico border to get a firsthand perspective of problems caused by the recent surge in illegal immigration. This was my second trip to the border since being elected to Congress. 

Conditions along the southern border are extremely troubling to me. Last month alone, the U.S. Border Patrol reported over 172,000 apprehensions, including more than 18,000 unaccompanied minors. This represents a 15-year high, according to the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and other news outlets. Border Patrol agents personally told me they are overworked and overwhelmed.

I believe we now have another humanitarian crisis caused by this surge of illegal immigrants, which is directly attributable to several policy changes of this Administration:

	•	halting all new construction of the border wall; 
	•	resuming a “catch and release” policy that allows people caught entering our country illegally to be released inside the U.S., many of whom never show up later for their hearing in immigration court; 
	•	ending President Trump’s policy requiring those seeking asylum to remain in Mexico until their asylum hearing, instead of being released within the U.S.; 
	•	ending fines for those illegal immigrants who willfully defy court-issued deportation orders.

Efforts to Pack the Supreme Court
Over 150 years ago, Congress set the number of Supreme Court justices to nine. Earlier this month, liberals in the House and Senate introduced legislation that would expand the size of the Supreme Court to 13 justices.

Let me be clear: I do not support expanding the number of Justices on the Supreme Court. In fact, I’ve co-sponsored a constitutional amendment that would limit the number of Supreme Court Justices to nine, and I will oppose efforts to pack the court with additional justices.

President Biden's American Jobs Plan
As you may have seen, the President recently rolled out his infrastructure proposal known as the American Jobs Plan. According to the White House, this plan will cost roughly $2,000,000,000,000 (two trillion). 
 While I do believe that the federal government has a role to play in the maintenance of our nation’s infrastructure, I do not feel the President’s proposal is properly targeted or responsible with taxpayer dollars. I have been very outspoken on this issue. Be sure to check out my positions in more detail by clicking here or the button below.

What I've Been Working On
Since January, I have sponsored or co-sponsored over 200 bills in the House of Representatives. I would like to highlight three pieces of legislation that I am an original co-sponsor of:

H.R. 2384, No Vaccine Passports Act

As more people get vaccinated for COVID-19, I oppose the idea of any federal vaccine passport. Therefore, earlier this month, I co-sponsored a bill in the House (H.R. 2384) that would prevent any federal agency from issuing standardized documentation to show proof of vaccination. 

As well as co-sponsoring this bill, I also joined a group of Congressmen in a letter to S.C. Governor Henry McMaster asking him to use his authority as governor to block any such implementation of vaccine passports here in South Carolina.

My Recent Op-Ed on Energy Policy  I believe there is a balance to be struck between environmental protections and economic innovation. As the ranking member on the Environment Subcommittee, I plan to advocate for harmony between the two. I recently published an Op-Ed in the Washington Times further explaining my positions.  Click here or on the button below to read more. 
Read My Op-Ed

 H.R. 619, the Born-Alive Act
 
Recently, I signed what’s known as a “discharge petition” that would force this bill in order to bring the Born-Alive Act to the House floor for a vote. This bill would simply provide babies born-alive after a failed abortion the same chance at life as a baby born any other way. I will always support the sanctity of human life and I believe that life begins at conception. Click here or the button below to see my positions on pro-life legislation.

4/23/21 19:55,"Dr. Paul Weekly Newsletter April 23, 2021","Dear Friend,
You can find my latest update below!  
Dr. Rand Paul visits Calvary Christian School in Covington, Kentucky, to Discuss Schools that Remained Open During the Pandemic   Last week, I had the honor of speaking to the faculty of Calvary Christian School in Covington, Kentucky, where I commended them and several other Kentucky Christian schools around our state for continuing to put our children's well-being first and remain open throughout the school year. 

The youth of Kentucky are our future. By allowing children to return to learning in the classroom, we can ensure that they will be able to make up for the lost time that is so crucial to their development.   As the number of infections continues to drop, over a third of the population has received the vaccine, and with death rates on the steady decline, we are beginning to see many people returning to a sense of normalcy.   You can watch my full remarks HERE. 
Dr. Rand Paul Hosts First Spring Service Academy Fair for Kentuckians Interested in Applying to the U.S. Military Academies   On Tuesday, my state office hosted our very first Spring Service Academy Fair. We had over 60 participants from across Kentucky, four Academy Representatives, and three Academy Board Members. Students were given the opportunity to hear updates on each military Academy and learn more about the application process.  I commend each of these students for their interest and desire to serve in the United States military, and I wish them the best through the remainder of their application process.   Interested applicants can apply HERE until November 15, 2021.   Feel free to contact my state office at 270-782-8303 if you have any questions. 
Dr. Rand Paul Joins Republican Coalition in Letter Banning Earmarks   As a member of Congress, I believe in ensuring your taxpayer dollars aren’t going towards fraud and waste.  Earmarks have long been the currency of corruption – wasting millions of tax dollars on special interest projects cloaked as “Community Project Funding” while ultimately prioritizing rampant waste.   This is why I joined other Republican Senators in a pledge to maintain the Republican Conference’s ban on earmarks. I am glad to report that at our weekly meeting this past Wednesday we were successful in keeping the ban in place.   We remain vigilant that as taxpayers you deserve better and we will stop any legislation where your tax dollars are being abused on wasteful spending practices.   You can find the full letter HERE.   Dr. Rand Paul Talks with Heritage Foundation on Election Integrity    Last week, I spoke with the Heritage Foundation on the importance of safeguarding our elections and ensuring election integrity.  

The common story we now hear is that the courts thoroughly vetted the election results. This is simply wrong and did not happen.    A number of states failed to follow the constitutional process of the state legislature determining its voting procedures and safeguards. We should all support voting being an individualized process — one person — one ballot — and one vote.    Rather than federalizing our elections, I believe we need to reform the election processes at the state level. We can make it easier to vote, but we shouldn’t make it easier to vote fraudulently.     In Kentucky, we succeeded in passing a bipartisan election reform bill, and have largely set an example for other states across the nation.      I encourage all states to pass much needed election reform, focusing on individualizing absentee ballots, and encouraging in-person voting – ultimately expanding voting opportunities by allowing more days for early voting.     You can watch the full conversation HERE. 
Media Wrap-Up 
This week, I joined America Reports, and The Story with Martha MacCallum on Fox News, The Water Cooler with David Brody, and Washington Watch with Tony Perkins, where I discussed infrastructure, earmarks, and Planned Parenthood’s shameless attempt to apply for PPP loans, despite their ineligibility.  

 
I also joined The Real News with Natalie Harp on One American News Network, EWTN Global News Catholic Network, Julie Mason Mornings on Sirius XM, and The Tony and Dwight Show on WHAS 840.   I joined several Kentucky TV stations including FOX44, KFVS12, WOWK, and ABC36.   Tune in this Sunday at 10:00 a.m. ET, I’ll be on Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo on Fox News.

Dear Friend,  
To help answer common questions about how to receive a COVID-19 vaccination, I am sending regular updates on the vaccine so that you have access to timely information. If you’d like a friend or neighbor to receive this information as well, please have them sign up for my newsletter here.  
As of April 29, walk-ins at state-run mass vaccination sites are permitted for any New Yorker who is eligible for the vaccine. As of now, appointments are still required for non-state-run sites. 
For specific questions or concerns regarding the vaccine rollout in New York State (NYS), please call the New York State Department of Health hotline at 1-888-364-3065, or fill out the online form here. Additionally, Nassau County has a dedicated hotline to assist seniors in scheduling vaccine appointments. Seniors can call (516) 227-9590 on Monday-Sunday from 9:00 am-4:45 pm. 
NYS recently launched its “Excelsior Pass” app as a way for people to confirm with businesses or venues that they are vaccinated or have negative COVID test results. Please note that all public health guidelines must still be followed after vaccination. If you would like more information, please click here.  
GENERAL UPDATES 
On May 13, the CDC announced that fully vaccinated Americans could remove their masks in most indoor and outdoor public settings. Following this announcement, New York State determined that it would follow the CDC’s new guidelines. Therefore, beginning May 19, fully vaccinated individuals are no longer mandated to wear a mask in certain public locations.  
Please note there are exemptions for pre-K to 12 schools, public transit, shelters and correctional facilities, nursing homes, and health care settings. Unvaccinated individuals and those who are not yet fully vaccinated must continue to wear masks. You are not fully vaccinated until two weeks after the administration of your last dose. For more information on this change in guidance, visit the NYS website here.   In addition, President Biden has announced a new program from Lyft and Uber to help get America vaccinated. The ride sharing companies will provide free rides to and from vaccination sites from May 24 to July 4.    Lastly, NYS announced last week that all students attending in-person SUNY and CUNY classes in the next academic year will need to show proof of vaccination. 
TYPES OF VACCINES   
In the U.S., there are currently three vaccines that have been authorized to fight against COVID-19: the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two shots, spaced 21 and 28 days apart respectively, while the Johnson & Johnson vaccine requires only one shot. 
After a thorough safety review of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, the CDC and FDA announced on April 23 that the temporary pause on the use of the vaccine should be lifted and use of the vaccine should resume. The pause allowed world-renowned health experts to examine and assess the risk of extremely rare blood clots after six cases were reported following administration of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. This pause also allowed the FDA and CDC to communicate with health providers and physicians to ensure they were aware of the potential for these adverse events and could properly treat them.   The CDC and FDA determined that the vaccine’s benefits outweigh its potential risks and that the risk of this outcome is very low. Of the millions of doses administered thus far, very few cases of this blood clot were reported. You can read the joint statement on the CDC website here for more information. Following the federal government’s review, NYS resumed use of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine. You can read the state’s announcement regarding the Johnson & Johnson vaccine here.   On May 10, the FDA announced that it would authorize the use of the Pfizer vaccine for adolescents aged 12 through 15. On May 12, a CDC advisory committee endorsed its use for this age group and the CDC director adopted this recommendation.   The CDC notes that other vaccines are being reviewed as well, including AstraZeneca and Novavax’s vaccines, which are currently in clinical trials You can learn more about each vaccine and vaccine safety on the CDC website here.  
VIRUS VARIANTS 
In the last few months, we have witnessed the spread of different variants of the virus that causes COVID-19. These variants have appeared all over the world, though strains from the United Kingdom, South Africa, and Brazil are the primary ones being tracked. The CDC has previously announced that the British variant is now the most common strain of the virus in the U.S.   In light of this information, there is concern amongst scientists, health officials, and the public as to whether or not our current vaccines will work against these new strains. Although studies on this precise topic are still ongoing, early data has shown that the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson vaccines still offer some protection against the new variants.   Furthermore, the FDA has issued guidance to allow vaccine manufacturers to respond to virus mutations with much greater speed by reducing some regulatory steps as we learn more about these new variants. Although more research needs to be done, manufacturers note that booster shots or annual vaccinations, similar to flu shots, may be needed going forward.

Have you heard about the new Child Tax Credit?The American Rescue Plan, which I voted for, strengthens the Child Tax Credit. It’s now available to more families than ever. It’s also now worth up to $3,600 per child for families with kids who are 5 years old or younger – a $1,600 increase. Families with children between 6 and 17 years old may also qualify for a credit worth up to $3,000 per child.Additionally, starting as soon as July, eligible families will be able to receive their expanded Child Tax Credit payment in monthly installments. To qualify, make sure to file your tax taxes by this year’s May 17th deadline! I know lots of hardworking Kansans have had a hard time in this pandemic. Now, the stronger Child Tax Credit is here to deliver relief to thousands of families in the Kansas Third District. This is money that’ll go right into the pockets of middle- and working-class families. It's a critical reform that can help our economy work better for everyone – not just those at the very top.Even if you don’t normally file taxes, filing now will ensure you can receive advance payments on time.Please click here to learn more about how you can file for free this year on the IRS website. Many people can file online with free software, or use free fillable forms instead. Below is a quick report from our team on how the new Child Tax Credit can help you. You can also click here to read it if you’re having trouble seeing it.
    
I was raised by a single mom. We didn’t have much when I was growing up. To think of the difference this would have made in our lives is staggering. The new Child Tax Credit is a lifeline for many folks. It means more money that more families can put towards food, childcare, diapers, health care, and education.Here are some other things you should know about the Child Tax Credit: • The American Rescue Plan makes the Child Tax Credit fully refundable. • The American Rescue Plan also makes the Child Tax Credit an advanced monthly payment. Starting in July and running through December, a family with kids who are 5 years old or younger can receive up to $300 month per child. Families with children who are between 6 and 17 years old can receive up to $250 a month per child.• Families will get their remaining credit when they file their 2021 tax return. Eligible children must have a Social Security number, be under 18 years old by December 31st, 2021, and be claimed on the filer’s return.• Families are eligible if they have children, adopted children, stepchildren, half-siblings, foster children, grandchildren, nieces or nephews, or certain other relatives. • Click here to learn more about the Child Tax Credit on the IRS website to see how it can help you and your family. And if you need help with filing this year, please know that help is available. • Click here to see our earlier tax help resources email update in case you missed it. It has a variety of resources to help taxpayers during this. You can also click here to visit our Help for Taxpayers web page for more information. • Questions? Reach out to the Overland Park Taxpayer Assistance Center for help by appointment. Please click here to learn more or call 844-545-5640.• Free Tax Return Preparation Help: Some taxpayers are eligible for free preparation help. For example, the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance program, or VITA, generally helps people who earn $57,000 a year or less. The Tax Counseling for the Elderly program, or TCE, also offers free preparation help, generally for people who are 60 years and older. You can click here to learn more about these programs and other assistance. The new, stronger Child Tax Credit is a critical piece of the American Rescue Plan. I voted for this law to get vaccines into people’s arms, money into people’s pockets, and relief to people who need it. It’s helping to end this pandemic once and for all and is turning our economy around. It’s about delivering strong, targeted, and effective relief to hardworking Kansans in the middle- and working-class – not billionaires, large corporations, or special interests. It is an honor to serve you in the U.S. House of Representatives. Our team is here to make a difference in the lives of everyone in the Kansas Third District, whether we agree on everything or not.Please feel free to forward this information to anyone you know so they can get relief from the Child Tax Credit too. If you have any questions, you can always contact me. My warmest regards,  Sharice L. DavidsMember of CongressP.S.

December 24, 2020 


2020 has been a challenging year across our state and our country. We’ve lost friends and family members, and many have struggled to stay afloat financially. And just earlier this month, our state mourned the passing of a principled leader and tireless advocate for Maryland, former Senator Paul Sarbanes. His leadership in preserving the Chesapeake Bay, expanding access to affordable housing, and protecting Main Street investors and consumers from fraud and abusive financial practices are enduring testaments to his legacy of positive change. This is one more loss in a year that has been full of profound hardship, struggle, and pain for so many Marylanders – and has tested the will of every American. 
Reflecting back on this year, I’m heartened by the strength and resilience of our communities in weathering these challenging times together. I’m inspired by the frontline workers, researchers, and medical professionals who put themselves in harm’s way to keep Americans safe in this time of crisis. And I’m grateful for all of those who have fought to protect our democracy, promote equality, and speak truth to power. 
Getting Coronavirus Aid Across the Finish Line
As I write this letter, we are waiting anxiously to determine whether President Trump is going to sign the new, desperately needed bipartisan coronavirus relief measure that Congress passed on Monday. The President has thrown a final curveball into the process by suggesting he may veto the bill. Doing so would further delay relief to American families and could trigger an avoidable government shutdown. I agree that the direct payments to Americans should be larger – and have supported previous attempts by Democrats to raise these payments to $1,200. But Republicans have repeatedly blocked these efforts, including a push just this morning by Democrats in the House of Representatives to raise the dollar amount of these stimulus checks to $2,000. Only Republicans are standing in the way of us getting this done.  
Now more than ever, Americans are feeling the weight of the pandemic. From watching more of their neighbors and family members fall ill, to struggling to pay mounting bills and put food on the table – the costs of this virus are all too real. That’s why I was pleased Congress was able to come together this week to pass a bipartisan relief package that will bring more support to those who need it most. 
This package isn't perfect, but I’m glad that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were able to find common ground and put this plan on the table, and I was pleased to have fought for many of the priorities that were included here and to have helped resolve the final dispute over the powers of the Federal Reserve.  
This bipartisan package makes important progress on provisions that will help Americans weather the storm this winter, including an extension of expanded unemployment benefits and the federal eviction moratorium, as well as rental and food assistance. It also includes direct payments to help millions of families and provides an infusion of funds to many of the programs that are key features of the bipartisan CARES Act, including a more-targeted Paycheck Protection Program focused on the small businesses most in need and those in hard-hit minority communities. In addition, the bill provides necessary resources for testing, tracing, and vaccine distribution. Throughout the negotiations, I worked with my colleagues to include a number of provisions that I’ve been fighting for since the beginning of the pandemic – including vital funding to extend economic relief for families and small businesses, support our transit systems, connect students, families and small businesses to broadband, and bolster SNAP and other nutrition assistance programs. 
That being said, I remain disappointed that while this package provides funding for schools, vaccine distribution, and other programs that will relieve budget pressures on state and local governments, it does not provide them with direct support. I strongly believe there is a need to ensure our cities and towns on the front lines of the fight against the pandemic have the resources necessary to keep our communities safe, provide emergency services, and keep first responders on the job. Also, while I’m pleased we got additional funds for broadband – including to support the costs for low-income families – I’m outraged that funding for students through the E-rate program for distance learning was made into a partisan issue by Senate Republicans. I will continue to fight on both of these fronts. 
This package does not include everything I had hoped for – and the Congress will need to work together with the Biden Administration to provide more support in the future. But this plan will help families, workers, and small businesses across the country battle the impact of this pandemic over the winter months, and it would have been unconscionable for Congress to leave without providing this essential help. 
Standing Up for Our Troops and National Defense 
In addition to his veto threat on the COVID-19 relief package, the President yesterday vetoed the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). This vital legislation includes a pay raise for our troops, critical investments for Maryland’s military installations, and support for key national security priorities. Trump’s veto of this bill, which has passed Congress and been signed into law without fail every year for the last sixty years, is based on the worst of reasons. He’s taking this unprecedented step because it does not include unrelated provisions to punish Twitter for fact-checking his lies and because it moves forward on renaming military bases that glorify those who fought with the Confederacy to protect slavery. It’s clear that once again President Trump is putting his ego and his own self-interest before the interests of the American people, our armed forces, and our national security. This veto will be welcome news to our adversaries. I urge a Congressional override of this action as soon as possible.
Supporting Maryland Priorities
I was glad to see Congress agree on a bipartisan government funding package to invest in crucial priorities across our country and prevent another shameful government shutdown. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I fought for a number of key provisions in the final spending bill that will directly benefit Marylanders – including funds to strengthen our schools, invest in health care services and biomedical research, support key federal facilities and installations in Maryland, modernize our infrastructure and transportation networks, and boost research and preservation efforts for the Chesapeake Bay. 
I was also pleased to see the Senate unanimously pass a number of bipartisan bills I’ve been working on throughout this Congress. First, the Senate passed my Child Care Protection Improvement Act, legislation that I introduced alongside Senate and House colleagues that will bolster criminal background checks for childcare employees and better ensure our children are safe. It’s now headed to the President’s desk, and I urge him to sign it without delay. The Senate also passed my bipartisan Protecting American Intellectual Property Act, which mandates strong economic penalties on firms and individuals involved in stealing American intellectual property. The need could not be more urgent – especially after the series of cyberattacks we have witnessed aimed at the COVID-19 vaccine. The Senate also passed my BUILD Act, legislation to ensure nonprofits like Habitat for Humanity are not constrained by overly burdensome regulations, so they can get help where it’s needed, fast. These bills must now pass the House of Representatives, and I hope that chamber will take action to move them to the President’s desk. Finally, I’m pleased that my bipartisan Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act has been signed into law, so we can protect American investors and their retirement savings from foreign companies operating on U.S. stock exchanges. This action will safeguard the millions of families that rely on modest investments to retire, send their kids to college, and weather financial emergencies. 
Honoring the Memory of Henrietta Lacks with Action
The Senate has also passed the Henrietta Lacks Enhancing Cancer Research Act, named after Marylander Henrietta Lacks who died of cervical cancer in 1951. While treating her for cancer, doctors took samples of her tumor and created the HeLa cell line from her remarkably resilient tissue – the first human cell line that was able to reproduce indefinitely. Without her or her family’s knowledge, Henrietta Lacks had her cells used for medical research, which helped lead to some of medicine’s most important breakthroughs, including the development of the polio vaccine and treatments for cancer, HIV/AIDS, leukemia, and Parkinson’s disease. 
For too long, Henrietta Lacks’ story went untold. While our nation will never be able to adequately express its gratitude for her historic contributions to medical research and the countless lives her cells have saved, this legislation is a step in the right direction. This Act would direct the Government Accountability Office to study and publish a report regarding barriers to participation in federally funded cancer clinical trials by populations that have been traditionally underrepresented in such trials. The bill will help ensure that all people – especially those from communities of color – are fairly represented in cancer trials and ultimately receive the treatments they deserve. I was honored to introduce this legislation alongside my friend, the late Elijah Cummings, and I’m proud that Henrietta Lacks’ family supported the effort to improve cancer treatments in her name. This bill is now off to the President’s desk, and I urge him to sign it into law immediately. 
Looking Toward the Year Ahead
Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall once said, “The measure of a country’s greatness is its ability to retain compassion in times of crisis.” I’m hopeful that the inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will usher in a new era of compassion in our politics and in our government’s response to the ongoing public health and economic crisis. President-elect Biden has promised to be a President for all Americans – someone who will fight to better the lives of both those who voted for him and those who didn’t. From day one, I’ll be working with the Biden-Harris Administration to support America’s workers, families, and small businesses as we continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic. And I’ll be fighting for Maryland priorities in our efforts to build back better: from rooting out systemic racism, to creating an economy and education system that provides all Americans with the opportunity to succeed, to passing a 21st century infrastructure bill that will expand access to broadband, strengthen public transit, and invest in green technologies. I look forward to working with the Biden-Harris Administration to address these pressing challenges facing our nation. 
Despite these difficult times, I hope you’re able to find joy this holiday season with loved ones and family members, together or apart. This wasn’t the year any of us expected, but I know that we will get through it. Our brightest days are still to come. I wish all Marylanders a happy and safe New Year. To 2021!

2/7/21 10:45,The Budget,"THE BUDGET

This week, Democrats passed a budget to trigger a process called reconciliation. Reconciliation allows Democrats to pass President Biden's wasteful $1.9 trillion stimulus plan on partisan lines. Americans and small businesses need help as we continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, but there is still $1 trillion left from previous stimulus bills Congress has passed. 

In this episode of Buddy's Briefing, we explain the reconciliation process and more.

HONORING A HERO
Also this week, we honored Officer Brian Sicknick as he laid in honor in the U.S. Capitol. He will forever be remembered as a hero and his sacrifice will never be forgotten. 


We continue to pray for his family, friends and colleagues.

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCXCVIII

Monday, February 1, 2021:   I’m in our Savannah office this morning as I have the opportunity to meet with representatives from Skalar Pharma, LLC, an American pharmaceutical company that manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). 

Rep. Carter meeting with Skalar Pharma, LLC. 
Next, I have a call with our new White House liaison who happens to be from Georgia and has a home on St. Simons Island in our district.  After a great introductory call, I join an Energy and Commerce (E&C) GOP Health Subcommittee virtual call where we discuss issues we want to bring up in the subcommittee this year.  Afterwards, I join in on our daily all-staff conference call before heading out to Nightingale Homecare, Infusion and Pharmacy Services in Savannah where they are administering the COVID19 vaccine.

Brad Wenstrup (R-OH), a podiatrist.  Our numbers in the Doctor’s Caucus have grown significantly this session and we have been successful in placing our members on key committees in Congress.  Afterwards, I head to the House Chamber where I pay tribute to Dr. Karla Sapp, Ken Griner, Sen. Mack Mattingly, and Stephen Tootle.  A link to my tributes can be found here, here, here and here.  Once back in my office, I have a virtual call with representatives from the National District Attorneys Association before having a Facetime call with Ryan Beamon, a student at Savannah Country Day School (SCDS) as I surprise him with the news that he has received an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy.  After our weekly Georgia delegation lunch, I join in on an E&C Consumer Protection and Commerce (CPAC) Subcommittee meeting where we discuss fighting fraud and scams during the pandemic.  A link to my questions can be found here.

TENNESSEE COVID-19 VACCINE DISTRIBUTION UPDATES
On Monday, February 22, Tennessee began vaccinating residents 65+ and Phase 1b, which includes K-12, Child Care and Other First Responders.
The state of Tennessee has launched a new website where you can register to receive a COVID-19 vaccine at one of Tennessee's County Health Departments. You can visit the website at vaccinate.tn.gov.
The Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) recently expanded access to vaccines with a particular focus on rural and underserved areas. TDH is partnering with pharmacies and community health clinics to add more than 100 new vaccination sites across the state. The new vaccination sites for pharmacies can be found here and community health clinics here.
Certain Walmart and Sam’s Club locations are now serving as COVID-19 vaccine distribution sites. For more information on locations in East Tennessee, please see the list here.
For detailed information on vaccine availability and other COVID-19 resources in Tennessee, check out the state’s website, covid19.tn.gov. The site is updated daily, and you can check on vaccine availability, which populations are currently being served, and register for appointments in counties that offer them.
You can find county-specific vaccine information here.

TENNESSEE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ISSUES LONG-TERM CARE FACILITY VISITATION UPDATE
This week, the Tennessee Department of Health issued an update regarding the state’s long-term care facility visitation restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic: “State-specific visitation restrictions for long-term care facilities will end effective February 28, 2021. With the limited visitation restrictions no longer in place at the state level, state licensed long term care facilities (assisted care living facilities, residential homes for the aged, and non-CMS certified nursing homes) may develop their own facility-specific visitation policies. These facilities are encouraged to reference industry best practices, including the federal CMS guidance, when developing their policies. While the state-specific restrictions will end this Sunday, I want to emphasize that skilled nursing facilities certified by federal CMS must continue to follow the federal CMS Visitation Guidance, pursuant to federal limitations.”

IMPORTANT COVID RELIEF CHECK INFORMATION
If you’re eligible for a COVID stimulus relief check and have not yet received it, it may be because you need to file a 2020 tax return to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit. You have a few options on how to do this, according to the IRS:
You can use one of the IRS Free File partners to electronically file a 2020 tax return and claim your credit; or
In early February, you can use the IRS’ Volunteer Income Tax Return Locator tools to find somewhere local to get free tax help; or
Or, you can file a paper Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR and claim the credit on line 30. The Instructions for Forms 1040 and 1040-SR provide information starting on page 57 on how to compute your credit.

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS CONTINUES FINANCIAL RELIEF FOR VETERANS THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30
This week, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs announced the extension of debt relief for veterans through September 30, 2021. From the VA’s announcement:
The VA will continue suspension of collection on all Veteran benefit overpayments and medical copayment debts incurred after April 1, 2020. 
Veterans and beneficiaries with questions regarding benefit overpayments can see frequently asked questions, go online to submit requests or call 800-827-0648. Call volume is generally lower Tuesday – Friday.
For health care co-payment debts, Veterans should contact the Health Resource Center at 866-400-1238 for payments.

BEWARE OF THE GRANDPARENT SCAM

GET A FASTER FEDERAL TAX REFUND WITH DIRECT DEPOSIT
I wanted to pass along a message from the IRS: the fastest way to get your tax refund is by filing electronically and choosing direct deposit. Direct deposit is free, fast, simple, safe and secure. Taxpayers can even split their refund to have it deposited into one, two or three different accounts. Check out the IRS website for more information.

It’s Darkest Before the Dawn


As the old adage goes, “it’s always the darkest before the dawn” and it’s been very dark on the COVID-19 front recently. As we hope for light at the end of the tunnel, we can only pray that the light is not a train coming the other way. The federal effort lead by the Trump Administration known as ‘Operation Warp Speed’ yielded several highly effective COVID-19 vaccines in record time. Vaccines from multiple companies are being distributed to all 50 states and each state government has formulated its own plan on distributing these vaccines to their residents. 
In Missouri, Governor Parson and the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services are leading the effort to get the vaccine into people’s arms. Missouri has just concluded Phase 1A of its vaccine distribution effort, which focused on frontline healthcare workers and long-term care facility staff and residents. During this phase, over 200,000 Missourians received a COVID-19 vaccination.
Missouri is beginning Phase 1B of its vaccine rollout, which consists of three tiers. During the start of Phase 1B, the state is focusing on Tier 1, which includes individuals working in emergency services, in non-patient facing healthcare positions, and emergency management. Tier 2 includes individuals who are considered high-risk. This includes any individual over the age of 65, women who are pregnant, adults with cancer, and individuals with pre-existing conditions such as Sickle Cell Disease or Type 2 Diabetes. Tiers 1 and 2 are now active, which means individuals who fall within either tier now qualify for vaccination.
The third and final tier of Phase 1B will see individuals working in critical infrastructure receive this vaccine. This includes individuals working in education, telecommunications, government, information technology, transportation, and more.
Once Phase 1 concludes, Missouri will move on to a broader Phase 2. During Phase 2, individuals working in a wide array of industries including the financial services sector, manufacturing, agriculture, higher education, and more will be next to receive the vaccine. Phase 2 will also focus on communities that have been disproportionally impacted by COVID-19. 
The plan that Governor Parson and his team have created prioritizes those who are most at risk and critical infrastructure sectors that are essential to everyday life. I applaud the Governor and his team for creating a straightforward and transparent plan that will get the vaccine to those who need it most.
The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services has been completely transparent about their efforts to distribute the vaccine. They encourage individuals who qualify in Phase 1A and Phase 1B -Tier 1 to work through their employers to access the vaccine. Individuals who qualify under Phase 1B - Tier 2 should contact their local pharmacies or health care providers for access to a vaccine.
There are several resources where you can learn more about COVID-19 vaccine distribution in your area. Information on the various phases and tiers of vaccine distribution as well as general information about the COVID-19 vaccines can be found at https://covidvaccine.mo.gov/. If you believe that you are eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine during the current phase, you can find a map of all vaccine providers in the state at https://covidvaccine.mo.gov/map/. 
It is critical that Missouri continues to move forward with its vaccination plan and that the federal government continue to provide states with the support they need to ensure that they have the resources to put their plans into action. I will continue to work with state officials and monitor the progress of Missouri’s vaccine distribution plan closely.

Hoosiers,
 
It was another month of incredible progress moving forward from the pandemic and regaining a state of normality across America. I continue to have productive conversations with our neighbors here at home about reopening businesses, increasing access to COVID-19 vaccines, and getting people back out and about. Through it all, I'm proud to be working on behalf of Hoosiers to address our needs and better our great state.  Be of good cheer,


  


  

  

  
Businesses, distributers, farmers, and more across our nation are affected by the current shortage in truck drivers and commerce transporters. Recently, I joined the Indiana Soybean Alliance at Premier Ag Headquarters and visited Rose Acres' Cort Acre Farm in Seymour where I talked with local ag industry members about their experiences with shipping delays, how it affects their businesses, and commonsense solutions like the DRIVE Safe Act I introduced this Congress that address the truck driver shortage in our country.
  

  
We must support our nation’s heroes both in and after their time in service to our country. Recently, I visited an AgVets workshop in Lawrence County to see firsthand the great work they are doing to teach veterans about the many opportunities in agriculture and ways to get started in the field.
  

  
Recently, I had the opportunity to tour Caris College in Jeffersonville and speak with the school's administrative team. Institutions like Caris College play a critical role in the community by offering two-year degrees in competitive, growing health care fields. As our local economies continue to reopen and hire, the great educational institutions and worker training facilities in IN-09 are ensuring Hoosiers will be well trained for a career field of their choosing.
  

  
Business investment in IN-09 is vital to the betterment and success of our District, which is why I was so excited to stop by Lehigh Hanson’s expansion project in Mitchell. During construction, the project is spurring approximately 1,000 jobs and will continue to bring hard-working Hoosiers job opportunities once the development is finished.
  

  
Stopped by Norma Jean’s Pastries in Franklin to visit with Whitney, the owner, sole employee, and pastry chef behind this wonderful small business. Thanks to the unwavering support of the Franklin community, Norma Jean’s Pastries successfully made it through COVID-19 and Whitney was able to open the first ""brick and mortar"" location this month!
  

 
I had the opportunity to visit Big Time Trading/Deep Blue Gear recently, touring their warehouse and discussing how COVID-19 impacted they business over the last year. While shutdowns and supply chain disturbances hit the company hard, they’ve recently regained a lot of their business as more and more coastal states reopen and anticipate massive growth this summer.
 

 
This week, I stopped by the Bloomington Airport to tour their Jet Center, which handles maintenance and charter services. Due to travel restrictions over the last year, airports across the country saw a drastic drop in service, and I was proud to support the Jet Center's efforts to secure funding from the CARES Act to keep airport operations up and running.  
 

  
Protecting Seniors from Scammers- Too often, financial predators target senior citizens, who fall victim to the scams. That is why, this month, I joined Rep. Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) in introducing the Senior Security Act, a bipartisan effort to fight on behalf of our senior citizens and protect their life-long savings and investments from financial scammers.
  

  
Click here or above to watch my floor speech in support of the Senior Security Act.
 
Growing Climate Solutions Act- I'm proud to cosponsor the Growing Climate Solutions Act, legislation that's designed to help farmers and foresters access carbon markets that allow them to get rewarded for implementing climate-smart practices.

Congress Should Deliver Consensus COVID-19 Relief Right Away ""At long last, let’s do what Congress does when we want an outcome. Let’s make law on all the subjects where we agree, on all the areas where President Trump is ready to sign bipartisan relief into law.""  
U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) delivered remarks this week on the Senate floor regarding COVID-19 relief, saying: 
""Kentuckians also know hope is in sight. Our state’s workers are standing by at the UPS Worldport in Louisville and the DHL Express Americas Hub in Northern Kentucky, key logistics centers that will play crucial roles in sending vaccines across the country.   ""Our people are hurting, but they are ready to finish this fight. Congress should not keep them waiting for reinforcements that should have arrived months ago. Compromise is within reach. We know where we agree. We can do this. We need to do this. Let’s make law.""

McConnell, Paul, and 36 Senate Republicans File Brief Urging Supreme Court to Reaffirm Religious Liberty Still Exists in a Pandemic 
Majority Leader McConnell, Senator Rand Paul (R-KY), and 36 of their fellow Republican Senators announced Friday they are submitting an amicus brief to the United States Supreme Court in support of Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron’s religious liberty lawsuit, Danville Christian Academy v. Beshear. 
In the brief, Senator McConnell and his colleagues explain that the Constitution cannot permit the selective and overzealous targeting of religious institutions by local officials who seek to impose stricter restrictions in the name of public health than the restrictions enforced against similar but non-religious establishments. In this case, Governor Beshear in Kentucky has unconstitutionally ordered K-12 schools including religious schools to shut their doors while permitting preschools, colleges, business offices, entertainment venues, and many other secular institutions to remain open.  ""Everyone understands this has been a challenging time for local leaders, but pandemics don’t erase our First Amendment rights,"" said Senator McConnell. ""Courts have repeatedly had to defend Americans of faith from overzealous officials who have tried to treat religious institutions in a uniquely disfavored way relative to other parts of society. Enough is enough. I am proud that Kentucky’s own Attorney General Daniel Cameron is leading the way to defend the religious liberty of Kentuckians and all Americans.""
McConnell: Life Lessons That Move Me to Help Every Kentuckian Reach for the American Dream

McConnell and Barr Announce $1.1 Million for Transitional Housing to Promote Long-Term Recovery in Kentucky Federal Recovery Housing Program authorized by CAREER Act  
On Tuesday, Senator McConnell and Congressman Barr announced Kentucky received $1,116,000 for substance abuse transitional housing programs from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s (HUD) recently-launched Recovery Housing Program. The HUD program was authorized by the CAREER Act, which was introduced in the Senate and House by McConnell and Barr, respectively. President Trump signed the CAREER Act into law as part of the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act.  The CAREER Act recognized the links among transitional housing, steady employment, and long-term recovery for those suffering from substance abuse. The law directs HUD to establish a pilot program focused on the 25 areas hardest-hit by the substance abuse epidemic. Kentucky, along with 23 other states and DC, were chosen to receive federal funds to support those in recovery.  ""As Senate Majority Leader, I’ve mobilized the federal government to tackle the opioid and substance abuse crisis by directing over $275 million to our Commonwealth’s comprehensive prevention, treatment, and enforcement efforts,” said Senator McConnell. “Congressman Andy Barr has been an indispensable partner in this effort, including to promote safe, transitional housing options for Kentuckians rebuilding their lives. I look forward to working with him and the dedicated professionals across Kentucky as we help save lives from addiction.""
Kentucky Air National Guard Selected for Eight New Aircraft Congressional Delegation Supported Federal Funding and Advocated for Kentucky  
Senators McConnell and Paul, Congressmen Hal Rogers (KY-05), John Yarmuth (KY-03), Brett Guthrie (KY-02), Thomas Massie (KY-04), Andy Barr (KY-06), and James Comer (KY-01), along with Governor Andy Beshear (D-KY) recently announced the Kentucky Air National Guard’s (ANG) 123rd Airlift Wing was selected to receive a squadron of eight new C-130J aircraft, replacing its current fleet. Only four Air National Guard units in the entire country were chosen by the U.S. Air Force in a competitive stationing process.  The 123rd Airlift Wing, based in Louisville, is among the most highly-decorated ANG units in the nation having received 18 Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards. The Kentucky Congressional Delegation contacted Secretary of the Air Force Barbara Barrett on multiple occasions in support of the unit’s selection, touting its premier abilities and strategic location.  ""Kentucky is grateful to the 123rd Airlift Wing and the 8,000 soldiers and airmen of our Commonwealth’s National Guard for their dedication to protecting our communities and our country. As Senate Majority Leader, it was a privilege to help bring these aircraft to the Bluegrass State,"" said Senator McConnell. ""For several years, my colleagues in the delegation and I have supported the necessary federal funding for these planes and highlighted Kentucky’s critical role in defending our country. Secretary Barrett made an excellent choice for the new C-130J aircraft, and I look forward to the 123rd Airlift Wing’s continued excellence at home and abroad.""

April 28, 2021
Dear Fourth District Constituent, The last four years inflicted unprecedented damage to our democracy and our standing in the world. It will take time and sustained action to climb out of that darkness.   After the first 100 days of the Biden-Harris administration, we are on our way. We are emerging from crisis stronger, safer, healthier, and ready to make the change that America needs. As President Biden addresses a joint session of Congress and the American people tonight, I will be in the House chamber watching with confidence that Democrats are working improve Americans’ lives and livelihoods as our country moves toward a brighter tomorrow. President Biden will continue to be focused and committed to addressing the needs of the American people.  The life-saving American Rescue Plan is bringing in critical resources to our communities, families, and small businesses to help usher us from crisis to recovery. Here at home, nearly $4.9 billion in American Rescue Plan funds are arriving in Minnesota. More than four million Minnesotans have received $1,400 checks, unemployment benefits have been extended, about 56% of eligible Minnesotans have received at least one dose of the COVID vaccine, and 42% are fully vaccinated. Small business relief programs have been replenished and extended, and state, county, local, and tribal governments are getting the resources needed to ensure essential services can continue. Schools are getting help to ensure re-opening in person instruction can be done safely. The extension of the child tax credit will cut childhood poverty in HALF – including lifting more than 10,000 children out of poverty right here in the Fourth District.   Unfortunately, not a single Republican in the House or the Senate voted for this critical aid – instead choosing to abandon families and small businesses looking to Congress for help. It is a shameful display of callous insensitivity that won’t be forgotten. Read my full statement on the final passage of the American Rescue Plan here. 
I'm proud of what President Biden has already accomplished, from his leadership in enacting the American Rescue Plan, to proposing investments in our families and our infrastructure, to taking action on behalf of the American people with executive orders to reduce gun violence and protect our DREAMers. 
I look forward to working with Senate Democrats and the Biden administration over the next 100 days to continue making progress for the American people.  
House Democrats have passed legislation in support of our For the People agenda. See below for a legislative update.  
It is an honor and a privilege to serve you in Congress. If you need help navigating a federal agency related to American Rescue Plan benefits or other concerns, please reach out to my office. As always, thank you for being an informed and engaged constituent. Sincerely, 

 

  
Betty McCollum Member of Congress 
 
HOUSE DEMOCRATS LEGISLATIVE UPDATE 
ENDING GUN VIOLENCE It is past time to take meaningful action to end gun violence in this country. The House passed two bills that will help keep communities safer by preventing guns from being in the wrong hands, and ending the dangerous Charleston Loophole that allowed the mass shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in 2015. Read more about these bills here. 
SUPPORTING DREAMERSThe House passed H.R. 6 to enable Dreamers and those holding TPS and DED status to remain in the country they have long called home and where they contribute greatly to their local communities and economies. Dreamers are Americans in every way except on paper – and it’s time to change that once and for all. Home is here. Read more about H.R. 6 here. 
JUSTICE IN POLICING I’ve heard from many of you since the conviction of Derek Chauvin for the murder of George Floyd. Like you, I let out a sigh of relief seeing that moment of accountability. But the conviction does not return George Floyd to his loved ones, and it is only one single case. Systemic change and a comprehensive approach are needed to ensure responsible policing – that’s why I voted for the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. Read more about this bill here.  
DEMOCRACY REFORM H.R. 1 strengthens access to the ballot box, fighting back against the harmful legislation like the bill recently passed in Georgia making it illegal to give folks water while standing in line to vote. The For the People Act is the most comprehensive anti-corruption and clean elections effort in a generation. It puts us on a path toward a more equitable and just future where all American voices are heard. Learn more about H.R. 1 here. 
PROTECTING WORKERS’ RIGHTS Studies show that workers who can join a union have higher pay, better benefits, and safer workplaces. Strengthening workers’ ability to exercise their constitutional right to organize will help rebuild the middle class and improve quality of life for more Americans. Read more about the House-passed PRO Act here.EQUALITY ACT I voted for H.R. 5, the Equality Act, which would amend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to ensure LGBTQ+ Americans are fully protected under the law. No one should be treated differently under the law simply because of who they are or who they love. Read more about the Equality Act here. 
WOMEN’S RIGHTS The Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) builds upon the original legislation by authorizing further resources to support victims and survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault, with provisions focused on addressing the crisis of missing and murdered Native American women. House Democrats also passed legislation to remove the arbitrary deadline to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, which would enshrine women’s equality in our Constitution once and for all. If the resolution becomes law, the ERA would become the 28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Read more here.STOP ASIAN HATEThe Fourth District has a vibrant, diverse, amazing Asian American community, and I stand with you all in the face of the rising tide of hate since the start of the pandemic. The horrific shooting in Georgia, where four Asian women lost their lives, was a heinous crime that underscores the urgent need for action. The House-passed COVID-19 Hate Crimes Act led by my colleague, Rep. Grace Meng, would ensure our justice system has the people and resources to effectively account for and mitigate anti-Asian hate crimes. I’ve also signed on to the Hate Crimes Commission Act of 2021 and the resolution Condemning All Forms of Anti-Asian Sentiment as Related to COVID-19, which you can read more about here and here. Hate has no home here. Period. 
MCCOLLUM-LED BILLS 
Recently introduced in the 117th Congress: 
	•	The Boundary Waters Wilderness Protection and Pollution Prevention Act (H.R. 2794) permanently protects the Boundary Waters watershed from toxic sulfide ore mining pollution.
	•	The Defending the Human Rights of Palestinian Children and Families Living Under Israeli Military Occupation Act (H.R. 2590) prohibits U.S. taxpayer funds in the form of military aid to Israel from being used to support or enable human rights abuses, including the military detention of Palestinian children, the demolition of Palestinian homes and property, or the illegal annexation of Palestinian lands.
	•	H.J.Res. 44 would enshrine health care as a fundamental human right for all Americans in the U.S. Constitution.

COVID-19 Coronavirus Response Update 
December 2, 2020 
Aloha, 
I hope everyone had a safe Thanksgiving! 
Based on the latest reports, it looks like the first round of vaccines will soon be delivered. The state is working on their draft vaccination plan which is subject to change based on when a vaccination is available and how much of it is initially available.
Given that there is still a lot of uncertainty, precautionary measures like wearing a face mask, maintaining physical distancing, and vigilant personal hygiene will remain necessary for months to come. By taking these precautions we can protect ourselves, our loved ones, friends, and neighbors.
If you are in need of assistance, please call me at (808) 541-1986 or email me at TulsiOffice@mail.house.gov. 
Mahalo and be well, 
  Tulsi Gabbard  Member of Congress (HI-02) 

COVID-19 News & Resources 
Testing and Tracing in Hawaiʻi — The Department of Health reports that there are 18,044 individuals in Hawaiʻi who have tested positive for COVID-19, as of the last reporting period. There were 543 new infections in the last week (77.6 new infections/day in the previous week).  
There have been 244 COVID-19 related deaths. In the last week there was 9 new death (1.29 deaths/day in the past week). 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, of those infections, 1,304 required hospitalization. 
The percent positive for the last 7 days of reported data is 1.6%. COVID Act Now reports that Hawaiʻi’s infection rate today is 0.97. An average of 4,670 diagnostic tests/day have been performed in the past week. 
Remember that an infection rate value that is greater than 1 means that the virus is spreading and for a given infected person, that person is infecting more than one other person.
The latest DOH reported number of active tracers is 429. This is reported for the week of Nov. 23-Nov. 29. 
George Washington University reports that, given the number of infections and the rate of infection in Hawaiʻi today, the state should have 565 active tracers. The GWU contact tracing tool can be found in the CDC’s guidance on contact tracing. 
The Department of Health is no longer reporting the number of cases that have been released from isolation or the number of active cases in the state.

Independent Advisory Committee Recommends Vaccination Priorities to CDC — The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices approved the following recommendation by majority (13-1) vote at its December 1, 2020 emergency meeting. 
When a COVID-19 vaccine is authorized by FDA and recommended by ACIP, vaccination in the initial phase of the COVID-19 vaccination program (Phase 1a) should be offered to both 1) health care personnel§ and 2) residents of long-term care facilities 
This recommendation was reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director. 
14-day Quarantine Requirement, Regardless of Pre-test, Now In Effect Now on Kauaʻi — Gov. Ige approved Rule 23, a temporary moratorium on the Safe Travels program for Kauaʻi, which means that all visitors, regardless of pre-test, will have to be quarantined for 14 days upon arrival. This includes inter-island travelers. 
County residents are allowed to quarantine at home but should take precautions to isolate from other household members and wearing a mask indoors is strongly encouraged. Visitors are also allowed to stay at a residence so long as the property is NOT listed as a TVR. 
Travelers can also stay at hotels and motels but must not leave their rooms. Visitors must make arrangements for all food and supplies to be delivered to their rooms. 
Another option for visitors is an enhanced movement quarantine property, also known as a “resort bubble.” If staying at such a facility, visitors are allowed to leave their room and roam within the property but still may NOT leave the property. 
Watch Mayor Kawakami’s video update for a rundown of the new measure that goes into effect today.

Last Week in Congress!
Today is Memorial Day, and we should all take this time to remember and honor the sacrifices of our men and women in uniform. Those that have sacrificed for our country and our freedoms will never be forgotten.    I am committed to serving you and the great citizens of West Virginia’s Second Congressional District. In order to provide you with greater access to our constituent services, I am setting up mobile office hours throughout the district, in addition to my offices in Martinsburg and Charleston. You are welcome to come and meet with my staff who will be happy to assist you or address your concerns. My office recently announced mobile office hours for the month of June. More details can be found below. 
 In this newsletter, you’ll find additional information on my action last week in Congress, COVID-19 resources, open grant applications, mobile office hour information, opportunities for students and more. For the latest COVID-19 vaccine information, visit www.vaccinate.wv.gov or call 1-833-734-0965.  
  
Memorial Day 

On this Memorial Day, I would like to express my deep gratitude for all those who have served our country in the Armed Forces. It is especially important we recognize the courageous patriots who have died fighting in defense of the freedoms we hold dear. As Americans, it is our sacred duty to protect and preserve their legacy and to spend this day honoring the incredible sacrifice that they have made on behalf of our nation. God Bless these brave patriots & God Bless America! 
  
  
Mobile Office Hours 

While I have District offices located in Charleston and Martinsburg, I want to provide constituents with the additional opportunity to visit with my staff in person for any further assistance. I’m proud to expand access to constituent services, including help with federal agencies, to various locations and venues throughout West Virginia’s Second District. I hope my constituents will find Mobile Office Hours a useful time to help address any questions or concerns. Check out this link for June hours and locations. 
  
Congratulations Academy Nominees 

I recently joined my colleagues in the West Virginia delegation in honoring our military academy nominees for Virtual Academy Day. In our country today, we need dedicated and patriotic young men and women to secure and defend our most sacred freedoms. I was very proud to see so many incredible students from West Virginia’s Second District committed to serving America. Congratulations to all of our nominees! 
  
Protecting Our Veterans 

Following the heinous murders at the Clarksburg VA Medical Center, I am proud to join Congressman McKinley and Congresswoman Miller in cosponsoring the Veterans' Camera Reporting (VCR) Act. Together we are ensuring that VA medical centers are upheld to the highest standards of patient safety, transparency and accountability for our nation’s heroes. Those who served our nation in the military deserve not only our utmost respect, but also continued care. 
  
Honoring Our Police 

I had the opportunity to meet Officer Buffington of the U.S. Capitol Police, whose parents live in West Virginia. We are grateful for the sacrifices law enforcement and their families make each day. Our communities are safer because of their dedication. I will continue to support our men and women in blue amid calls to defund the police. This month, we honored our police for National Police Week.  
  
Combatting the Opioid Epidemic 

Law enforcement officials in Randolph County are committed to eradicating the drug problem in the area but need additional resources to expand their efforts. I wrote this letter in support of Randolph County, West Virginia’s request for membership in the Appalachia High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA). This would be an important contribution to efforts in combating drug trafficking throughout the entire Appalachian region. 
  
Corridor H  

For years, I’ve advocated for robust funding for Corridor H. I am continuing to work in Congress to secure funding for the completion of this highway. This photo was taken about ten miles from the Virginia border. I’ve introduced legislation, the AID in Appalachia Act, to provide Appalachian states like West Virginia with increased flexibility and funding for projects like Corridor H. In West Virginia, this highway would allow for more private industry jobs to be created. When it is completed, this will open up the middle of our state in a beautiful way. Watch my video on this HERE.  
  
Law Enforcement Grant Opportunity 

I am excited to announce that the Department of Justice’s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) grants are open and are accepting applications. It is essential that we provide law enforcement agencies and officers with the resources needed to keep them, as well as our communities, safe. I urge qualifying agencies and organizations in my district to apply for this funding. Contact my office for assistance in the process.

Dear Friend, 
I want to provide you with an important vaccination update. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Community Vaccination Center at the Pipkin Building at the Memphis Fairgrounds closes TOMORROW, May 19th.  If you or anyone you know has yet to get the COVID-19 vaccine, I urge you to take advantage of the expanded capacity at the Pipkin Building before it ends tomorrow.   The Community Vaccination Center at the Pipkin Building has the capacity to vaccinate 3,000 people per day, thanks to the support of FEMA and the Biden Administration. The process is extremely fast and efficient, and it is open from 7 a.m to 7 p.m, with walk-ins welcome after 2 p.m. The site is located at 940 Early Maxwell Blvd in the Memphis Fairgrounds. After tomorrow, the site will continue to operate under the City of Memphis but with reduced capacity and with hours shortened to 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.  To make an appointment at the Pipkin Building, go to https://covid19.memphistn.gov/ or call (901) 222-SHOT (7468). You will also find more information on other vaccination sites in Shelby County, including public vaccination centers, pop up community locations, and private providers such as Walgreens, Kroger, Walmart, and Baptist Medical Group. All public vaccination centers are accepting walk-ups so no appointment is necessary. The sites include the Faith Baptist Church in Bartlett; Germantown Baptist Church in Germantown; Greater Imani Church in Raleigh; the Gill Center in Southwest Memphis; Southwest Tennessee Community College in Whitehaven; and the Pipkin Building.  The expanded capacity at the Pipkin Building and at sites across Shelby County is an impressive undertaking. I urge you to take advantage and get vaccinated. All vaccines are free and anyone aged 12 and up can now get vaccinated without a wait or hassle. It is the quickest, safest way to get back to life as usual for yourself and the country. Do it for yourself, for your family, and for the whole community. Please do not hesitate to contact my office at 901-544-4131 with any questions. 
As always, I remain. Most sincerely,  
Steve Cohen Member of Congress

During my trip to the southern border, I witnessed firsthand the need for additional resources to effectively handle the humanitarian and national security crisis on our southwestern border. That’s why, I’m introducing the Border Surge Response and Resilience Act. This bipartisan bill requires the Department of Homeland Security to establish a plan to address migrant surges at the border. The bill also makes it easier for Customs and Border Protection to access the resources they need to keep our country secure and provide vital humanitarian support.


I-81 Project Update
 
In a House Transportation & Infrastructure Hearing, I had the opportunity to speak with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg about the I-81 viaduct project. I emphasized the importance of this project to the City of Syracuse and the surrounding region, and reiterated my request for him to come up to Syracuse to see the current site of I-81 firsthand.

Legislative Update: Bill to Support Survivors of Domestic Abuse 
 
I announced the reintroduction of the Family Violence Prevention and Services Improvement Act (FVPSA). Since it was first authorized in 1984, the FVPSA has played a vital role in supporting survivors of domestic violence and their children. My bill would reauthorize this important program, ensuring local, state, and tribal governments, as well as critical service providers in our communities, have the resources necessary to prevent violence and provide essential protection and support services to survivors.

Update on Local Water Infrastructure Projects
 
I spoke with the Commander for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Buffalo District, to discuss the backlog of water infrastructure needs on Lake Ontario and the importance of these projects to keeping our communities safe. With these challenges in mind, I was proud to have provisions enacted through WRDA to expand federal investments in Lake Ontario’s southern shoreline and support critical coastal resiliency efforts. I look forward to continuing to partner with the Army Corps to ensure these projects get the attention and funding they require.

Nearly $2 Million in Federal Funds for Early Education in Wayne County
 
I’m glad to announce that Wayne County Action Program, Inc. is receiving nearly $2 million in federal funds to bolster their Head Start Program. In Wayne County, Head Start is an invaluable resource. Each year, hundreds of local children receive quality educational programming to help them develop and prepare for school. Unfortunately, at a time when these services are needed most during the pandemic, many Head Start providers have been burdened with new costs that threaten their ability to continuing serving families in-need. With this new funding, children in Wayne County will have the resources they need to grow.

Over $5 Million in Pandemic Relief Funds for Syracuse Hancock International Airport
 
I’m glad to announce that the Syracuse Hancock International Airport will receive over $5 million in additional relief funds. This funding will support the Airport’s efforts to protect travelers and staff from COVID-19 and ensure it is able to continue operating as a hub for residents, tourists, and businesses. The funds will also be used to support in-terminal concessions and other local businesses who experienced hardship during this ongoing crisis.

2021 Congressional Art Competition 
 
Each year, my office has invited high schoolers from across Central New York to enter into the Congressional Art Competition. I’m excited to announce that we are now taking submissions from young artists for this year’s competition. The winning piece will be hung up in the U.S. Capitol for one year so visitors from across the country and around the world can see firsthand the impressive artistic talent we have in Central New York. I encourage anyone who is interested to click on the link below for guidelines.

As always, thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter!

12/26/20 8:58,Good Riddance 2020,"December 26, 2020 
Dear Fellow Marylander:   This has been a roller coaster of a year – physically, mentally and emotionally.    More than 18.5 million Americans have been infected with COVID-19 and the list of related deaths stands at 326,000 and growing. Currently, we are losing more people in one day to COVID-19 than our nation lost on 9/11.    Tens of millions lost their livelihood and schools were transformed, seemingly overnight. Even with vaccines starting to reach frontline health care workers and others at risk, we have many more months of challenges to come before our nation, and the world, might emerge from the darkness of the current global pandemic.    We all have seen everyday moments and life events changed or canceled because of the precautions put in place to keep us safe from harm. Hugs have been postponed or replaced with elbow bumps and Zoom calls, which we all know really are not the same.    Next week, I will offer an overview of my policy priorities heading into the 117th Congress, which begins on January 3, 2021. For today, I want to share my personal priorities and what I hope for all Marylanders.   To start, I would like to see all of us rally around the idea that keeping each other safe and healthy is as important as keeping ourselves safe. Respect for others should replace selfishness as we keep up the basic steps we can take to remain safe: wear a mask, maintain six feet of space from people not in your household, and wash your hands frequently. Receiving the vaccine does not eliminate the need for these personal health measures, at least not yet, so keep at it.   I am hopeful that we can return to a level of what we might call “normal” at some point in 2021. For this to happen, it will take all of us following those basic steps to defeat this virus. We saw what happened this summer when we rushed ahead of the science. At the very moment we thought we were “flattening the curve” and breaking the first wave of infections, people grew lax and started to take liberties that we weren’t ready for. Super-spread events, including family gatherings, caused the trends to reverse themselves quickly. Yes, there were many who tried to say this pandemic was a hoax and walked right into risky situations. Most of those folks have learned better by now. Hopefully, the others will begin to understand the seriousness and act accordingly.    When we do find ourselves emerging from the weight of this pandemic, I hope we can keep up the spirit of neighbors helping neighbors. As more individuals and families found themselves vulnerable and wondering what their next meal might be or if they were going to be able to pay the rent, others who were in more stable positions stepped up to provide community support. Our nonprofits and faith groups, as well as local governments and school systems, expanded the safety net to provide meals and groceries to a wider universe of those in need. Even the federal government made it easier for families to get assistance.    Like you, I am looking forward to the day when we can safely enjoy a meal at a cozy restaurant or have friends and family over for a celebration without fear. I’d like to be on the sidelines cheering at my granddaughter’s lacrosse game again without wondering if I was standing too close to others. Zoom Thanksgiving and Zoom funerals can happily stay in 2020, although, admittedly, these events did bring together people from far distances who may not have otherwise been able to gather in person pre-COVID.    Life will be different post-COVID. We aren’t there yet, but as we reach the end of a life-altering 2020, I would ask you to think about how you were forced to do things differently this year. What worked better than you thought it would and what would you want to do more of in the future? Consider what we all can do better and what absolutely should end. All of us, working together and as individuals, can move us forward to a place where the good grows stronger, the system changes to expand opportunities where some may have never existed, and the bad fades into the background.    For those who have experienced pain and loss over the last year, I grieve with you and hope 2021 brings you comfort and healing.    Thank you to all who have contributed to keeping our communities safer and helped others get through these very tough times.    Together, we can say good riddance to 2020 and welcome to 2021!

12/4/20 15:36,Medicare Open Enrollment,"Ends December 7th
 
  Dear Lindsey, 
I know that health care is top of mind for many of us right now. Before I share some helpful resources regarding Medicare Open Enrollment, I want to thank everyone who joined our town hall yesterday. The panelists and I appreciated your thoughtful questions, and we hope you came away from the call more confident in your health care options than ever before. This message is a follow-up. If you don’t have a chance to read the entire e-newsletter, I want to highlight the most important point up front: the deadline to sign up for Medicare coverage or update your existing plan is December 7th.  
I’ve said it before, but it bears repeating - there is nothing more important to me than the health and well-being of our community. Since coming to Congress, the number one issue in our community has been health care. Even before the pandemic, I prioritized protecting and strengthening Medicare. I cosponsored and helped pass several bills that expanded options for our seniors and assisted them with their Medicare applications. Access to health care is even more critical now as we continue to face this pandemic. Our office is always here to serve our community and even more so during these tough times, so please reach out with any questions.   In This E-Newsletter You Will Find:
Recent Events — Including a recording of our Medicare Open Enrollment Town Hall that featured two special guests, Sharon Graham from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services and Edward Lafferty from the Social Security Administration.   Resources: Finding Health Coverage for Your Family —  Including helpful links and resources to sign up for Medicare for the first time or reevaluate your existing plan.   My Track Record Improving Access to Quality, Affordable, and Accessible Health Care  — Including my legislative record to protect and strengthen Medicare.

Recent Events
Thanks for Joining Our Medicare Open Enrollment Town Hall


ICYMI: We were lucky to have two special guests join us yesterday, bringing nearly five decades of combined experience with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and the Social Security Administration (SSA). Listen to our full conversation here. For information on coverage plans, visit www.medicare.gov or call 1-800-MEDICARE. 

Resources: Finding Health Care Coverage for Your Family
Find a Plan for Your Family Today


Since its passage in 1965, Medicare has enabled Americans to live longer, healthier, and contribute more to our communities. I’m writing to you today because I want to encourage everyone who is eligible to take advantage of the open enrollment period and find coverage that fits your family’s needs and budget. 
We are in the open enrollment period right now, but it only lasts for a few more days. You must choose your Medicare plan by December 7th if you want to make any changes for 2021. If you are satisfied with your current plan and it is still offered, you don’t need to do anything. Learn more here.  
There are a number of resources available to help you and your family find the best coverage:  
	•	Under the new “Plan Finder” at www.medicare.gov, you can compare pricing between various Medicare plan options, get plan costs and benefits, and build a personal prescription drug list. 
	•	Information on coverage options is available by calling 1-800-MEDICARE. 
	•	A basic overview of your current coverage is outlined in the “Medicare & You” handbook, available online at www.medicare.gov/medicare-and-you.  
	•	For those of you looking for more detailed information, I’ve included a comprehensive FAQ at the end of this e-newsletter. 
 My Track Record Improving Access to Quality, Affordable, and Accessible Health Care 
Stabilizing Health Care Costs

During my time in Congress, I have fought for our seniors, cosponsoring and passing several bills to protect and strengthen Medicare. I included some of my most relevant legislative actions below: 
	•	I cosponsored H.R.2000, the Medicare-X Choice Act of 2019. This legislation would allow all Americans to buy a public health insurance plan. That plan would pay doctors the same prices that Medicare currently does, and it would allow patients to be seen at the offices and hospitals that Medicare has in network. Furthermore, the Medicare X plan would cover things that Medicare does not, such as pediatrics and maternity care.  
	•	When I heard from constituents and advocates who missed open enrollment due to COBRA continuation coverage and then struggled with signing up for Medicare, I cosponsored the bipartisan Medicare Enrollment Protection Act to protect seniors from gaps in their coverage or having to pay higher premiums. 
	•	I also cosponsored the SAVE for Seniors Act, a bipartisan bill to ensure that Medicare enrollees can gain access to any approved COVID-19 vaccine without a cost share.  

Our community is a caring and pragmatic one that understands every person deserves to live a healthy life. I will continue to bring our values to Washington to deliver for our Commonwealth and country.

Medicare Open Enrollment Information and FAQs
When is the Medicare Open Enrollment Period? Every year, Medicare’s open enrollment period is October 15th – December 7th. 
What is the Medicare Open Enrollment Period?
Medicare health and drug plans can make changes each year—things like cost, coverage, and what providers and pharmacies are in their networks. October 15 to December 7 is when all people with Medicare can change their Medicare health plans and prescription drug coverage for the following year to better meet their needs.

What does Medicare Cover?
Medicare includes Part A, Part B, Part C (Advantage), Part D, and Medigap- all of which cover basic medical needs. 

Medicare Part A: mainly covers hospital services. This includes: Inpatient hospital care, inpatient rehabilitation care, skilled nursing facility care, nursing home care, home health care, and hospice. 

Medicare Part B: covers medical services. This includes: Preventive medical care, diagnostic medical care, treatment of medical conditions, durable medical equipment, mental health services, certain outpatient prescription drugs, telehealth services (part of the present response to COVID-19 pandemic). 

Medicare Part C (Medicare Advantage): offered by private insurance companies approved by Medicare. When you join a Medicare Advantage Plan, the plan will provide coverage for all your Plan A and Part B services. Medicare Advantage plans may offer additional coverage such as hearing, dental, vision, and health and wellness programs. Many plans also include Part D, prescription drug coverage. 

Medicare Part D: provides prescription drug coverage. This is added onto original Medicare (part A and part B). Each plan has a formulary, which is a list of prescription drugs it will cover. 

Medicare supplement (Medigap): provides coverage for costs associated with original Medicare. Medigap is health insurance sold by private insurance companies to fill the “gaps” in original Medicare plan coverage. In order to buy a Medigap policy you must have Medicare Part A and Part B. 

When am I eligible for Medicare?
People age 65 or older are automatically eligible to enroll in Medicare. In some cases, individuals under the age of 65 who have long-term disabilities are also eligible. Medicare eligibility is as follows: When you turn 65 years old, you are eligible to enroll in Medicare 3 months before your 65th birthday and up to three months afterward. If you receive monthly disability benefits through either the Social Security Administration or Railroad Retirement Board, you are eligible for Medicare after 24 months. If you have been diagnosed with end stage renal disease and have a kidney transplant or require dialysis, you are eligible to enroll in Medicare. 

What is the implication of not signing up for Medicare Part B when I am eligible?
If you choose not to enroll in Medicare Part B and then decide to do so later, your coverage could be delayed, and you may have to pay a higher monthly premium for as long as you have Part B. Your monthly premium will go up 10 percent for each 12-month period you were eligible for Part B, but didn’t sign up for it, unless you qualify for a ""Special Enrollment Period"" (SEP). 

If you don’t enroll in Medicare Part B during your initial enrollment period, you have another chance each year to sign up during a “general enrollment period” from January 1 through March 31. Your coverage begins on July 1. 

How much does Medicare cost?
Each Medicare part that you enroll in has costs associated with it, including premiums, deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance. 

Part A: Costs for Medicare Part A include: A premium of anywhere from $0 to $458 per month, depending on your income. A deductible of $1,408 per benefits period. A coinsurance of $0 for the first 60 days of an inpatient stay, up to the full cost of services depending how long you’re admitted.

Part B: Costs for Medicare Part B include: A premium of $144.60 or higher per month, depending on your income. A deductible of $198 in 2020. A coinsurance of 20 percent of the cost of your Medicare-approved amount for services. An excess charge of up to 15 percent if the cost of your services is more than the approved amount.

Part C: Medicare Part C costs can vary depending on your location, your provider, and the type of coverage your plan offers. Medicare costs include: Part A costs. Part B costs. A monthly premium for the Advantage plan. A yearly deductible for the Advantage plan. A drug plan deductible (if your plan includes prescription drug coverage). A coinsurance or copayment amount for each doctor’s visit, specialist’s visit, or prescription drug refill.

Part D: Medicare Part D costs include: A monthly premium. A yearly deductible of $435 or lower. A coinsurance or copayment amount for your prescription drug refills. 

Where can people find Medicare plan information or compare plans?
1-800-MEDICARE or Medicare.gov.   

If you need additional help signing up for Medicare or still have unanswered questions, here are some additional resources that may be helpful:
	•	Medicare.gov has information about important forms, locating providers, informative brochures, and more.  
	•	CMS.gov has up-to-date information about official legislative changes and updates to the Medicare program.  
	•	SSA.gov allows you to access your Medicare account and more Social Security and Medicare resources.

McKinley Takes The Lead In Fighting For American Workers & Fossil Fuels
 
 
This week Representative David B. McKinley, P.E. (R-W.Va.), Ranking Member of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment and Climate Change, led and moderated a virtual forum entitled “President Biden’s Cancellation of the Keystone XL Pipeline and American Jobs.”
 

 
During McKinley’s opening remarks, McKinley pointed out that the only result Biden got in cancelling the pipeline was lost jobs and lost wages of American workers:
 
 
“Through the use of an executive order, President Biden has revoked the permit needed for the project to cross the U.S. and Canadian border. And he stated that completing the project doesn’t serve 'the national interest' and it 'would not be consistent' with the administration’s economic and climate priorities. Curiously, though in 2013, President Obama’s State Department found that development of Keystone XL would have 'minimal impact on the environment.' And when President Trump took office in 2017, his administration took action quickly to move the project forward and work resumed. Then 4 years later Biden revoked the permit issued by his predecessor. And in so doing has cost the area approximately 11,000 jobs and $2 billion in lost wages. In reflecting on this denial how do lost jobs and wages serve the national interest?”
 
Listen to Representative McKinley’s Full Opening Remarks
 
During his period of questioning, McKinley highlighted the fact that pipeline workers who were displaced by the Biden Administration’s energy policies would not be able to find the same wages in another job.  
 
MCKINLEY: “Given that there are 11,000 jobs that have been lost, would those workers be able to find other employment with the same wage base in your immediate area?” 
 
STOODY: “We’ve certainly seen when you look at the comparable jobs, that many of the jobs they can find are lower in pay, up to 30% lower in pay and there’s fewer of them. So depending where you are getting a green job or a renewable job might be a good thing, but people should really pause if the policy is to force people to take the pay cut or force people out of work.”
 
Listen to Representative McKinley’s Questions for Participants
 
 
 
 
WTAS: Forum On The Cancellation Of The Keystone XL Pipeline
 
 
What They’re Saying About The Forum:
 
E&E News: “House Republicans warned yesterday that motivations behind the White House's action to cancel the controversial Keystone XL pipeline have the potential to affect other pipeline networks caught in the midst of environmental backlash.”
 
Washington Examiner's Daily on Energy: “Rep. David McKinley of West Virginia said Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce Committee will be aiming to show the consequences, such as lost jobs and higher electric bills, that they argue Biden’s policies will bring about…McKinley, who came up with the idea to hold the forums, described the effort as similar to a ‘shadow cabinet’ in parliamentary governments that scrutinize the actions of the majority party and offer alternatives.”
 
Politico’s Morning Energy: “Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce climate change subcommittee will hold a pro-Keystone XL pipeline forum today, focusing on how Biden’s rejection of the project last month will hurt local jobs and workers.”
 
The Inter-Mountain: “McKinley and others believe that the Biden administration’s tone — set by his January executive order — will freeze further oil and natural gas pipeline development. Instead of curbing the use of fossil fuels, discouraging domestic oil and natural gas production will just shift production overseas to countries with more lax environmental standards.”
 
The Wheeling Intelligencer: “While President Joe Biden is pitching a multi-trillion-dollar infrastructure package to Congress, First District Congressman David McKinley, R-W.Va., reminded people one of Biden’s first acts as president was canceling an infrastructure project with possible repercussions for West Virginia.”
 
WV MetroNews: “McKinley, the Environment and Climate Change Subcommittee’s ranking member, said the president’s decision will result in lost jobs and economic opportunities. He also warned the administration’s actions could lead to similar cancellations of other oil and natural gas projects.”
 
WV News: “Rep. David McKinley, R-W.Va., gathered a group of stakeholders together Tuesday afternoon for a virtual forum on the cancellation of the Keystone XL Pipeline Project. The transnational oil pipeline, planned to run from western Canada to Texas, was canceled on the first day of President Joe Biden’s administration, when he signed an executive order revoking a key permit…McKinley, who serves as the Republican leader of the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Environment and Climate Change Subcommittee, said Biden’s order will lead to the loss of around 11,000 jobs and $2 billion in wages.”
 
KRTV of Great Falls, MT: “A virtual forum was held Tuesday, hosted by by U.S. Representative David McKinley of West Virginia. Among concerns discussed were the economic impact that cancelling the pipeline is expected to have on counties, including some in Montana, that the pipeline would pass through.”
 
KBZK of Bozeman, MT: ""Elected officials from the U.S. and Canada on Tuesday discussed concerns about President Joe Biden’s decision to temporarily stop construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. A virtual forum was held Tuesday, hosted by by U.S. Representative David McKinley of West Virginia. Among concerns discussed were the economic impact that cancelling the pipeline is expected to have on counties, including some in Montana, that the pipeline would pass through.""
 
 
 
ICYMI: McKinley Celebrates WVU Medicine And Wheeling Hospital Partnership
 
 
Last Friday, Representative McKinley attended a celebration for the merger between WVU Health Systems and Wheeling Hospital. With this merger, Wheeling residents will be able to access more specialty care and other services they may have not been able to before. 
 

 
During the event McKinley claimed the merger provided Wheeling with ""hope"": 
 
“I think what they’re doing is they’re providing us hope. That’s what’s needed so much in this country, and in our valley — something that’s not a false premise,” McKinley, R-W.Va., said. “It’s something we can count on, and WVU gives us the basis for that.”
 
More information on the merger can be found on The Wheeling Intelligencer. 
 
 
McKinley Advocates Against Supreme Court Packing
 
 
This week, Democrats introduced legislation that would expand the number of Supreme Court justices from 9 to 13. 
 
President Biden, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and even sitting Senators have all previously made statements against this partisan move.
 
In response to the Democrats' attempted power grab, Representative McKinley signed onto the ""Keep Nine"" legislation that would propose an amendment to the Constitution that would keep the number of Supreme Court justices to nine. 
 
 
 
McKinley Pushes Back On Unjust Impact of Democrats' Climate Change Bill 
 
 
This week, Representative McKinley delivered opening remarks that highlighted how energy policies included in the CLEAN Future Act will force individuals, families, and entire communities into poverty.
 
In his opening remarks, McKinley stated: “As America dismantles its fossil fuel economy, the rest of the world is expanding its use of coal, natural gas, and oil and emitting greenhouse gases at an alarmingly increasing rate. By eliminating jobs in fossil fuels, Congress will be sentencing American workers all across the country to poverty. How is that outcome any different than the injustices created in the past? So maybe it's time for the men and women of government to lose their sanctimonious attitude and walk in the shoes of these families who are about to experience poverty.”
 

 
Listen to Representative McKinley’s Full Opening Remarks
 
During his five minutes of witness questioning, McKinley pointed out that as Democrats rush to implement the use of electric vehicles and renewable energy, they forget about how the materials needed for batteries are sourced. McKinley specifically reminded Democrats about the forced child laborers in the Congo who have to mine for cobalt:  
 
""Two of the key ingredients in batteries are lithium and cobalt, but have you ever seen how we source that material? This is an article that CNN posted of children in the Congo being forced into labor to harvest cobalt. Here’s another picture of another cobalt mine in the Congo. We're enabling dictators to use child labor. What about lithium? Have you ever seen the ravaging effects of lithium? Here’s a picture of a lithium mine, look at the depth in the community. These are ravaging effects we’re having on communities all across this world in our pursuit of having battery storage…we're exporting our guilt. It seems that environmental justice stops at the border.""

Remote Worker Program To Bring Long-Term Growth To The Mountain State
 
 
This week, Governor Jim Justice announced the launch of Ascend West Virginia, which is a remote work program, aimed at recruiting outdoor enthusiast professionals to the Mountain State. 
 
Ascend WV provides remote professionals with world-class recreation, uncrowded spaces, and a low cost of living while staying fully connected to their jobs. It also comes with a $12,000 incentive and a year’s worth of free outdoor recreation.
 
The program is supported by Kenova native Brad Smith, Executive Chairman of Intuit’s board of directors and co-founder of the Wing 2 Wing Foundation, and his wife Alys Smith.

Greetings,I hope this message finds you well. As your Representative in Washington, I wanted to provide you with an update on the happenings in Georgia’s Thirteenth District and in Washington, D.C. during the month of April 2021. 
COVID-19 Vaccines Available to All Georgians Ages 16+ 
 
The vaccine is safe, tested, and effective in reducing the spread of the virus. As of today, over 6.13 million doses have been administered in Georgia and 25% of Georgians are now fully vaccinated. 
	•	Click here to find a pharmacy near you.
	•	Click here to view the Georgia Department of Public Health Vaccine Dashboard.

Hearing on Rural Broadband A fast internet connection isn’t just about streaming videos or playing games – for many rural residents, it is the difference between access to telemedicine or online education, or going without. This month, I chaired a hearing to examine the current state of internet connectivity and to find ways to ensure that all our rural communities have fast and reliable broadband service.

In The News 
This week I spoke with Agri Pulse about my upcoming priorities as Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. 
""Black farmers “don’t have access to the same markets our white farmers have,” said House Agriculture Chairman David Scott, but the tax code could put them on equal footing.

1/29/21 18:42,Pre-Register for the COVID-19 Vaccine,"Dear friends and neighbors, 

Like the rest of the country, Central Floridians are eager and ready to defeat the coronavirus. We understand that you deserve a continued urgent response to get our country through this challenging period and towards recovery. That’s why House Democrats, along with the Biden Administration and Democratic Senate, are working to get you and your family the relief you deserve. Already, President Biden has issued Executive Orders that will help save lives and livelihoods during this crisis, including by: 
	•	launching a safe, effective vaccination campaign;
	•	using the Defense Production Act to speed up delivery of PPE and vaccines;
	•	expanding testing, treatment and the public health workforce;
	•	safely reopening schools, businesses and travel;
	•	improving health equity especially for communities of color;
	•	ensuring mask-wearing and other science-based steps to stop the virus’s spread;
	•	delivering relief by extending moratoriums on evictions, foreclosures and student loan payments, by strongly expanding food assistance for hungry families and by strengthening the ACA and expanding access to affordable, quality health care.

While there’s still work ahead of us, we can all work together to crush the virus by getting vaccinated. As of today, Floridians who are eligible can now pre-register for a vaccine appointment.  


After registration, individuals will be notified when appointments become available in their area. The vaccine is safe and effective, and I encourage everyone eligible to get vaccinated. Our community is counting on you!

Forging a New Partnership in Osceola County


This week, I witnessed the new partnership between American-owned SkyWater Technology Foundry and NeoCity, which will boost microelectronics manufacturing, protect our troops and create hundreds of high paying jobs in Osceola County! 


Fighting for Venezuela TPS 


The dire situation in Venezuela only continues to worsen. One thing is clear: Congress must protect Venezuelans in the United States and grant them temporary protected status. Thank you William Diaz and Casa de Venezuela Orlando for inviting me to talk about our Venezuela TPS Act last night!

Remembering a Hero


Our community mourns the loss of Chief Master Sgt. Richard Hall, a distinguished member of the Tuskegee Airmen and Central Florida native. We are deeply grateful for his invaluable commitment to serving our country and extend our sincere condolences to his family and friends. 

I was lucky enough to call Richard a dear friend and will forever remember our conversations about his time during World War II. Particularly, I will cherish our interview for the Veterans History Project with the Library of Congress. May his memory live on.

Working to Bring Patriot Spouses Home 


In 2018, Polk County resident Alejandra Juarez — the wife of an Iraq combat veteran and the mother of two U.S.-born daughters — was deported from the United States to Mexico as a result of the Trump administration's zero-tolerance immigration policy. 

﻿This week, her 11-year-old daughter Estela and I wrote letters asking President Biden to take executive action and direct the Department of Homeland Security to grant her parole and allow her to come home to her family. 

If this swift action is not taken, I am hopeful that my bills, H.R. 163 and H.R. 495, will help Alejandra and other veteran spouses return to the United States. 

We will not stop fighting until the Juarez family is reunited!

Fighting for our Precious Florida Coral Reefs 


Our Florida coral reefs contain some of the most diverse ecosystems on earth, and it is our responsibility to ensure that they are protected from the effects of climate change, overfishing, pollution and development. With this in mind, I proudly introduced the bipartisan Restoring Resilient Reefs Act of 2021, H.R. 160.

This crucial piece of legislation would reauthorize the Coral Reefs Conservation Act, which authorizes five years of federal funding and technical assistance to states, territories and local communities for the maintenance and restoration of coral reef ecosystems. 

I am proud to be a part of this effort and look forward to working with my colleagues in the House of Representatives and Senate to get it passed through both chambers and signed into law by President Biden. 

Additional Vaccine Resources

As COVID-19 infections rise in Central Florida, we are working with local officials to provide up-to-date information on vaccinations. For more information on your county's distribution plans, please visit the websites linked below.

Demand for the COVID-19 vaccine is far in excess of the supply the state has received so far. It is anticipated that additional supplies will be coming soon. Florida has many sites that are providing COVID-19 vaccines to eligible persons, but supplies are limited and appointments may not be available at many of these sites. The state is prioritizing persons 65 years of age and older and health care personnel with direct patient contact and residents and staff of long-term care facilities. Please be aware that some locations are only serving very specific populations, such as frontline health care workers. Appointments may be required and vaccine availability will vary from day to day and week to week, as we work to provide vaccines to the most vulnerable first. 
FULL LIST OF VACCINE SITES


In the face of unprecedented challenges, Central Floridians in our community have shown immense courage. From the heroic efforts of our healthcare workers and first responders to our essential workers and teachers, each of you has helped our community get through the coronavirus crisis. I am proud to be your representative and look forward to our continued efforts to improve our district.

2/16/21 16:00,#GetCovered,"Dear Neighbor,
 
As we continue to do all we can to keep our neighbors and loved ones safe and healthy, I want to take a moment to make sure you’re aware that it’s not too late to enroll in health coverage if you need it. 
 
President Biden has opened a special enrollment period on www.HealthCare.gov from February 15, 2021 - May 15, 2021, so that Americans trying to navigate this pandemic without insurance can log on and get covered. If you need coverage, I encourage you to visit HealthCare.gov, or click the button below, and find the plan that works best for you
  
  
CLICK HERE TO GET COVERED
  
  
COVID-19 has stolen the lives of more than 480,000 Americans and has infected 1 out of every 12. Many who recover are left with long-term health complications that will require care well into the future, even as they grapple with the lingering medical and financial consequences of the initial illness. Simply put, there has never been a more important time for us to ensure that every single American who needs coverage can get it.
 
That’s why Congress must take swift action on President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, which would take big steps to build on the Affordable Care Act, lower health costs, and expand access to care for all Americans, including those who have lost their jobs. In addition to increasing federal subsidies and lowering premiums, the plan incentivizes states to expand coverage to an additional four million people with low incomes, and provides states the opportunity to extend coverage for a year to low-income women who have recently given birth. Critically, the plan will also ramp up testing, tracing, and our national vaccination program so we can finally defeat this virus and get Americans back on their feet.
 
Please visit HealthCare.gov to enroll in coverage if you need it, and be sure to encourage your friends and family to do the same. We will get through these difficult times, but only if we continue to take care of each other. 
 
Be sure to visit the COVID-19 page on my website for more information and resources. If you have any questions or concerns, or if you need assistance, please don't hesitate to call us at (703) 256-3071.
  
Sincerely,

  
Gerald E. Connolly

Dear friend,
As we gradually resume our normal lives, prioritizing our mental health is critical. This Mental Health Awareness Month, please know there are many resources to help you and your loved ones. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offer information on mental health and crisis, healthy ways to cope with stress, and how to help others cope. You can access this information here.
San Diego County's vaccination efforts are now extended to children ages 12 through 15. Those in that age group are now eligible to receive the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. Parental consent is required prior to vaccination for anyone under the age of 18. Click here for more details.
This week, I continued my work from Washington, D.C. Below is another update on some of the work my staff and I have done this week to serve you.

This Week's Casework Success Story
Amy from Rancho Peñasquitos contacted the office in early March regarding an issue she was having with the U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA.) She's a permanent resident of the United States, but is also entitled to Canada Old Age benefits. The Canadian government required a record of her Social Security earnings as part of her application process and confirmed it had not received a response from the SSA in months. Our office sent an inquiry to the SSA Office of International Operations (OIO). By the end of March, the SSA OIO confirmed that the earnings records had been mailed to the Canadian Liaison office. A few days later, Amy informed my staff that she had received a letter of approval from Canada Service. 

“I just wanted to thank your office and especially your District Director who promptly attended to my frustrating issue with the SSA Administration and International Operations. With his assistance, the matter was resolved successfully in less than 3 weeks which also involved Canada Service with my Old Age Pension. I greatly appreciate your help.” 
- Amy from Rancho Peñasquitos

Legislative Work
STAND UP Act
This week, the House approved the bipartisan Suicide and Threat Assessment Nationally Dedicated to Universal Prevention (STANDUP) Act to encourage schools to implement suicide prevention training for students. Rep. Gus Bilirakis (FL-12) and I introduced the bill which applies to grades 6 through 12. It would require states, schools, and Tribes to implement commonsense, evidence-based policies to prevent suicides to receive Project AWARE grants, which boost youth mental health awareness among schools and communities.
A return to the classroom means that we must prepare schools to meet their students’ growing mental health needs. The STANDUP Act takes a proactive, evidence-based approach by equipping students and educators with the skills they need to identify, intervene, and get help for those at risk of harming themselves or others.
Joint Economic Committee hearing: ""Examining the Racial Wealth Gap in the United States""

During this hearing on Wednesday, I asked Mehrsa Baradaran, Professor of Law at UC Irvine's School of Law, about the success of federal Paycheck Protection Program loans set aside for minority groups and underserved businesses. I also posed a question about the importance of home ownership as a way to create generational wealth. Click here to watch this full exchange.

California Retired Teachers Association Annual Convention

Earlier today, I attended the California Retired Association's Annual Convention and received the ""‘Friends of CalRTA"" award. I thanked the organization for its partnership during my time in Congress and its tireless advocacy on behalf of retired teachers across California.

District Work
Commissioning of USS Miguel Keith

Last Saturday, I delivered the welcoming address at the commissioning ceremony for USS Miguel Keith at Naval Air Station North Island. USS Miguel Keith was built by San Diego’s own General Dynamics NASSCO and bears the name of Marine Corps Lance Corporal Miguel Keith who was killed in action while defending his platoon in Vietnam. We wish USS Miguel Keith, and all who sail upon her in service to our great nation, Fair Winds and Following Seas.

Honor Flight San Diego Seeks Veterans
Honor Flight San Diego, a non-profit dedicated to escorting San Diego County veterans to Washington D.C. to visit the memorials dedicated to their service, is seeking WWII and Korean War veterans to go on their Honor Flight. The next flight departs from San Diego and is scheduled for October. Veterans pay no costs for this three-day trip. For more information, click here.

Participate in our Weekly Poll!
We've recently introduced a new section in our e-newsletter for readers to weigh in on a relevant topic. Thank you to everyone who has participated so far. Here's this week's question:
Yesterday, the CDC announced that fully vaccinated Americans can now gather with others without masks indoors and outdoors, even if some in their group are not vaccinated. Do you feel safe following this guidance from this point forward if you're fully vaccinated? 
Click here to submit your answer via Google Forms. We'll share the results in next week's e-newsletter. Last week's question was: ""President Biden continues to lay out plans for comprehensive legislation like the American Families Plan and the American Jobs Plan. How important of a role do you think bipartisanship and compromise in Congress should play to move these plans forward?""
Here are the results: 
317 Responses: 22.7% Very important; passing big legislation should require the support of everyone. 34.4% Not all that important; passing big legislation needs to get done, with or without the support of both parties. 1.3% Not important; parties should not compromise.24.9% Bipartisanship is always important, whether or not big legislation is on the table. 16.7% Other

Dear Friend,
I’d like to take a moment to wish all our Middle and South Georgia mothers a very happy Mother’s Day. To all our Eighth District moms: I hope your day is full of rest and time with loved ones. 

Happy Mother’s Day to all the GA-08 moms. 
  
TIFTON NATIVE TO BE AWARDED NATION’S HIGHEST MILITARY AWARD 
Tifton native, Ralph Puckett, a retired U.S. Army Colonel and U.S. Army Ranger, will be awarded the Medal of Honor for actions during the Korean War. The Medal of Honor is our nation’s highest military award and is awarded to members of the U.S. military for distinguished acts of valor.
In November 1950, the Eighth Army Ranger Company seized and held a strategically important hill overlooking the Chongchon River with then-Lt. Puckett leading fifty-one soldiers in fighting off several hundred Chinese soldiers in a bloody standoff. Puckett became severely wounded and told his men to leave him behind, but they refused. Puckett received the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions of valor during the standoff.
After the Korean War, Puckett joined the U.S. Army Ranger Department and went on to lead companies during the Vietnam War, train cadets at West Point and Ft. Benning, and organize military leadership courses. Two U.S. Army Ranger Awards for leadership are named for Puckett, who retired from the U.S. Army in 1971 after twenty-two years of service to our country.
Puckett is an honorary Colonel of the 75th Ranger Regiment headquartered at Fort Benning and at 94 is still active with the Rangers and other soldiers at Fort Benning. 
Georgia and Tift County have always been very proud of their native son, Col. Ralph Puckett, ret., and we look forward to him receiving this distinguished award for valor.

PRESSING PRESIDENT BIDEN’S NEW TOP TRADE NEGOTIATOR ON UNFAIR TRADE PRACTICES 
President Biden’s pick for U.S. Trade Representative was recently confirmed by the U.S. Senate. Ambassador Katherine Tai will serve as our country’s top trade negotiator, and I joined several of my colleagues from agriculture-producing states in sending her a letter this week on trade issues important to American farmers.
For the last several years, I have been working to level the playing field for American farmers by addressing unfair trade practices that foreign countries exploit to dump cheap produce into U.S. markets below the cost of production domestically. These “race-to-the-bottom” practices are detrimental to our American fresh fruit and vegetable producers and make it difficult for them to compete in our domestic markets.
This issue was made worse this past year by the COVID-19 pandemic. Unprecedented labor and market disruptions made it uneconomical for some farmers to even harvest a crop, creating more reliance on cheap, foreign-subsidized produce over American-grown products.
I have and will continue to press for relief for our farmers and solutions to curb these practices. You can click here to read our full letter to Ambassador Tai on this important issue. 
  
BIDEN TAX PROPOSALS TO PAY FOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO AMERICAN FAMILIES 
To pay for his out-of-control spending and infrastructure proposals, President Biden and Congressional Democrats are planning to reform the tax code in ways that will cause financial harm to American families and businesses for years to come. 
Specifically, the Biden Administration is planning to eliminate the stepped-up basis allowances from the tax code and ramp up the taxation of capital gains at death. The allowance for stepped-up basis applies uniformly to all taxpayers, protecting families from unnecessary burdens upon the death of a loved one. Likewise, since its inception, our system of capital gains taxation has recognized that the appropriate time to tax gains on an asset is when that asset is sold, not upon death.
Unlike the estate tax, repealing stepped-up basis and applying capital gains at death, even with an exemption threshold, would create a massive new administrative burden for nearly every American family, farm, and small businesses. For instance, if a loved one passed and left their next-of-kin their home or property, the loved one would be required to pay the current tax rate on the home or property. This would be detrimental to American families, especially middle and low income families.
Over 130 Members of Congress sent a bipartisan letter to House Leadership opposing these proposed changes to the tax code for their impact to American families. You can click here to read our letter. 
  
VALDOSTA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE OPEN HOUSE 
It was good to be in Valdosta this past week for several meetings with local business owners and military leaders. I also had the chance to join the Valdosta Chamber of Commerce for an Open House event where I heard from members of the community about how their businesses are recovering from the negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.
With new investments and a recovering economy, the future is bright around our state, and opportunities abound for Georgians who lost work due to the pandemic or other reasons. I look forward to seeing continued growth in the Valdosta-Lowndes region, and I thank everyone who came out to this event.

Speaking with local business owners and community leaders at the Valdosta Chamber of Commerce Open House. 
  
HONORING OUR GA-08 LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS 
This coming week is National Police Week, a time to recognize and honor those who protect and serve. To all our Eighth District law enforcement officers: Thank you for your tireless work to keep our communities and families safe. We appreciate you each and every day. 
I’d also like to give a special recognition to our fallen officers and their loved ones. National Peace Officer’s Memorial Day is May 15th, the last day of Police Week, and I’ve recorded a special message to commemorate our fallen officers that I wanted to go ahead and share with you.

12/23/20 17:54,Coronavirus Updates,"Dear Neighbors,
Congress passed a funding and COVID-19 relief bill this week. This legislation is an all-encompassing package that delivers the resources we need to end the coronavirus pandemic and get help to hardworking Americans. It provides funding for vaccines, COVID-19 testing and contact tracing, and direct support to American families. 
As Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I authored key provisions in the bill to accelerate our response to the ongoing public health crisis that is devastating our country. Most importantly, this bill provides significant funding to states to limit COVID-19 transmission, including funding for the equitable distribution of vaccines and significant resources to continue the development and supply of additional vaccines. It also provides billions of dollars for expanded testing and contact tracing. It also gives up to $50 dollars per month to struggling families to help pay their internet bills. We cannot lose an entire generation of students to the digital divide.
This bill also protects Americans from surprise medical bills and represents the most significant expansion of patient protections since the passage of the Affordable Care Act. It’s long past time for Congress to take decisive action to protect consumers from the unreasonable and unacceptable practice of surprise billing. These bills cause tremendous financial devastation and a significant emotional toll for the families who receive them. I’m glad we were able to get the job done.
We also continue to help the fishing industry up and down the Jersey Shore with an additional $300 million in federal aid for fishing communities. Entertainment venues will finally receive the funding they need to survive, helping to preserve venues like the Stone Pony and dozens of music venues in Central Jersey and other historic places that mean so much to our communities.

4/17/21 9:30,What America Really Needs,"Congressman Smith's E-news: April 17, 2021  


This week I met with the Nebraska Alzheimer's Association for an update on their work to combat Alzheimer’s and dementia. This week I also met with the Nebraskans for the Arts for an update on how Covid-19 has impacted the arts and their plans for upcoming programming. Thank you to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society for sharing their thoughts this week on how expanded telehealth opportunities have improved patient care. Recently, I also received an update from the Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources at the University of Nebraska on our state's efforts to be leaders in agriculture innovation.  

What America Really Needs

Earlier this year, President Biden pushed his $1.9 trillion spending package, the American Rescue Plan, through Congress and signed it into law claiming it was a dire necessity because of the pandemic. However, his administration has been very slow in rolling out programs created by this massive bill despite saying it was so urgently required. Instead, they have been busy proposing more “emergency” spending, before money allocated in the previous bill has even been spent and while our economy has begun bouncing back, largely on its own.
 
From the moment he signed the bill, President Biden and his administration seemingly moved on from the American Rescue Plan and set their sights on another, more costly spending package, this time totaling $2.3 trillion. The proposed plan has been called an “infrastructure” package, yet the proportion of funds included dedicated to true transportation and infrastructure needs across the nation is surprisingly small. This new plan consists of less than 2% for waterways, locks, dams, ports and airports, less than 5% for broadband, and less than 6% for roads and bridges. These aspects of infrastructure are what both Nebraska and the nation need to improve upon, and they are largely ignored so that most of the package can be directed to creating new social programs, green energy incentives, and other government expansions that won’t help our businesses create jobs, produce goods or services, or sell them around our nation and the world. Communities in Nebraska, especially rural areas, would benefit greatly from an increase in broadband, and I would gladly support bipartisan legislation that would do so, but that is clearly not the focus of this package.
 
When breaking down the actual items in the infrastructure plan put forward, it is clear they have less to do with infrastructure and more to do with passing partisan policies masked as infrastructure. For instance, several aspects of the $2.3 trillion proposal would accomplish priorities listed in the Green New Deal. Electric vehicles are one of these items with the investment totaling $174 billion, that is more money than what would go to bridges and roads, or waterways and railways. Another example of the disproportional funding and masquerade of the Green New Deal is the $10 billion dedicated to establishing a Civilian Climate Corps. Our focus right now should be reopening our economy and getting Americans back to work, not asking Americans to change every aspect of their lives to implement an unproven left-wing agenda.
 
Along with the infrastructure plan recently put forth, the Biden Administration released their proposed blueprint for fiscal year 2022’s budget and it falls short. This $1.52 trillion proposal would increase domestic spending on existing programs by 16%, on top of what has been spent in the American Rescue Plan and is proposed for infrastructure. As with these other two spending plans, the President claims these proposals are intended to address areas of need in our economy, but they are actually focused on further expanding many of the same programs with no connection to COVID that he has included in past proposals.
 
Over the course of the last year, Congress came together to pass truly bipartisan spending packages to combat the coronavirus all while supporting the American people. Now, our economy is starting to recover, and our priority must be connecting Americans with jobs to allow our economy to flourish once again. Now more than ever we should not be increasing taxes on hardworking Americans and sending their jobs overseas, but that is precisely what the recently proposed plans from the Biden Administration would do. Congress must take action to serve the interests of our constituents and do what is best for our country, not what is prioritized by the far-left. 

Upholding Navigable Waters
This week, I joined over 100 of my colleagues in introducing a resolution to uphold the previous administration’s Navigable Waters Protection rule, which replaced the overreaching Obama-era Waters of the United States (WOTUS) regulation. Earlier this year, President Biden threatened the Navigable Waters Protection rule when he signed an executive order revoking a 2017 executive order calling for a review and reversal of the Obama WOTUS rule.
 
H.R. 619 Discharge Petition
This week, I signed the discharge petition for the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. This bill would require abortion providers to treat a baby who survives an abortion with the same level of life-sustaining care that a prematurely born child in any other setting would receive. If the discharge petition receives 218 signatures, it would force the bill's consideration on the House floor regardless of Speaker Pelosi's wishes. 

In the News
I recently spoke with Susan Littlefield of KRVN and the Rural Radio Network regarding how President Biden's 30 by 30 executive order impacts the agriculture community. Listen here. 

Along with a number of colleagues, I recently spoke with Phillip Brasher of Agri-Pulse concerning the Biden Administration's possible new tax proposals which may impact the family farm. Read here.

5/28/21 17:49,This is Our Shot,"Dear Neighbors,
I joined Governor Murphy today in Asbury Park to announce the “Shot at the Shore” program that will administer COVID-19 vaccines along the Jersey Shore over the holiday weekend. Vaccines will be available at three locations: Gateway National Recreational Area at Sandy Hook, the gazebo at Pier Village in Long Branch, and in Asbury Park at the Convention Hall arcade on the boardwalk. COVID-19 vaccines are the key to safely returning to normal patterns of life, and I encourage everyone who hasn’t yet received a vaccine to take advantage of this opportunity. Click here for more information


I attended a bipartisan meeting with Vice President Kamala Harris this week at the White House to discuss how we can work together to ensure every American has reliable, affordable broadband. It’s critical we act because in today's economy, internet access isn't a luxury – it's a necessity. We need transformative, future-proof investments in affordable broadband infrastructure.
I held a hearing this week in my Energy and Commerce Committee on the clean drinking water provisions in my CLEAN Future Act. Access to safe drinking water is essential to our health and prosperity as a nation. Unfortunately, it is far from guaranteed. Like many aspects of our lives, the Covid-19 pandemic has shown just how important access to safe drinking water is. My bill would provide federal funding to replace all lead pipes in our country. Read more here
I also held a hearing this week on what we can do to increase confidence in COVID-19 vaccines. Because of the vaccines, the number of new daily COVID-19 cases and deaths have fallen significantly since the start of the year. But we cannot stop until more Americans are protected from COVID-19. We now face the difficult task of reaching those Americans who have yet to embrace these life-saving vaccines. Read more here
I also wrote to the CEOs of Facebook, Twitter, and Google this week as part of an investigation my Committee is conducting into the tech companies’ continued mishandling of COVID-19 disinformation. I remain concerned that these companies are not doing enough to remove disinformation that is a threat to public health and our fight against the pandemic. Read more here

5/2/21 23:15,Weekly Wrap Up,"Dear Neighbor,
  
It is hard to believe it’s already May!  I was at home in Houston this week for a busy committee work week, and a chance to catch up with people at home.  I’m glad to share some of the highlights of this week.
  

  
As it has for people across the country, the coronavirus pandemic has changed the way we do things in Congress.  One of those changes is the new committee work week, dedicated to committee work and hearings but without votes.  Our hearings take place virtually, and you can watch them live (you can find links on my social media).
 
This week, the Energy and Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Health held a hearing entitled “The Long Haul: Forging a Path through the Lingering Effects of COVID-19.  The purpose of the hearing was to understand and address the effects of long-term COVID infection.  Over the last year, more than 30 million Americans have tested positive for COVID-19 and more 550,000 have died from the disease, including many here in our community.  While the majority of patients experience no or mild symptoms and recover, there is an emerging number of patients who report lingering effects of COVID-19, weeks and months after infection, which we called “long COVID.”  Long COVID is generally a range of symptoms that continue or appear weeks and months after an initial COVID-19 infection, including asymptomatic patients, and can include fatigue, brain fog, headache, and much more.  As the scientific community works to understand these effects, it is essential that we understand them and what we can do to help in Congress.
 
I also participated in the Energy and Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce hearing entitled “The Consumer Protection and Recovery Act: Returning Money to Defrauded Consumers.”  The purpose of the hearing was to understand and address the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) enforcement authority and the recent Supreme Court case that limited the FTC’s long-standing authority to seek to seek monetary relief or require bad actors to return money earned through illegal activity on the basis that it was not included in the statute.  I joined 13 of my colleagues to introduce H.R. 2668, the Consumer Protection and Recovery Act, to provide the FTC the explicit ability to obtain both injunctive and monetary equitable relief for all violations of the laws it enforces.
 
And, of course, members of Congress and people across the country watched President Biden’s address to a Joint Session of Congress, speaking about the progress we have made toward getting our country back on track and the challenges that are still ahead of us.  I was glad to hear his vision of hope and unity for our country, and I look forward to what more we can accomplish by working together. 
  

  
This week I co-sponsored H.R. 3, the Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act, to help lower the costs of prescription drugs—including by giving Medicare the right to negotiate the price it pays for prescription drugs.  This is an issue of vital importance to our district and in communities across the country.  We will hold a hearing this week on the Energy and Commerce’s Committee’s Health Subcommittee on this legislation. 
 
After my meeting with mayors and representatives from cities and villages across our district discussing the local relief funding provided by the American Rescue Plan, I sent a letter to the Treasury Department  requesting specific guidance on use of the funds.  I also joined my Texas colleagues calling on President Biden to use its renegotiation of the Medicaid Section 1115 waiver as an opportunity to increase the number of Texans who have access to health coverage.  And, I joined in a bipartisan letter to the U.S. Trade Representative calling for relief for American companies on Chinese imports, and I signed onto a letter urging President Biden to establish a new Fund for Global Health Security and Pandemic Preparedness.
 
I am also glad to share that after Texans in Congress called on the Department of Education to ensure Texas schools receive the COVID relief funds Congress intended for them to receive, Texas state leaders announced they are releasing $11.2 billion out of the $18 billion available in funding.   While delayed, this this is important progress to helping schools impacted by the pandemic—and I will continue to work with our Texas delegation to ensure schools receive the full amount Congress included for our schools under the COVID relief bills. 
  

  
I was glad to have the opportunity to visit with Brigadier General Christopher Beck and Colonel Timothy Vail from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Galveston this weekend as well as Harris County Commissioners Tom Ramsey and Jack Cagle to get an update on the Buffalo Bayou and Tributaries Resiliency Study and other projects important to our district and our region.
  

  
I had the opportunity to join Fox 26 News this week to talk about the importance of another important project to our region, the Ike Dike project.  You can watch our discussion here or by clicking below!  NBC News and the Houston Chronicle had helpful overviews as well. 
  

  

  
I was also glad to meet virtually with several groups this week, including a bipartisan group of members of Congress from our area to talk about projects of regional significance.   I also spoke with constituents working with the Alliance for Childhood Cancer, the Anthropocene Alliance and Residents Against Flooding, and Voters for Cures about their concerns.  And I had a great time speaking with boy scout troops this week, who are on their way to earning their Citizenship in the Community and Citizenship in the Nation badges. 
  

  
We are also wrapping up the TX-07 Spring 2021 intern class – so I thanked them for their hard work this semester!  My office is currently reviewing applications for summer internships and I look forward to welcoming our new interns soon!
  

  

  
Last week, I asked you about your experience with the COVID-19 vaccine, and I am glad to report back that the responses have been overwhelmingly positive!  People reported that providers and local authorities have made it easy to drive up or walk in, at no cost to the public.  If you need help accessing your vaccine, you can use this website to find a provider near you.  Additionally, starting today, anyone getting their COVID-19 vaccine at NRG Park can choose between Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer.  Vaccines are available at NRG Park from noon to 9 p.m. daily.  The vaccine is free, and no insurance is needed.  For more information, click here.
 
Currently, the COVID-19 positivity rate is t 10 percent, and there are more than 10,300 active cases of COVID in Harris County.  Our county remains under a severe threat level, meaning that we must take COVID precautions to keep one another safe.  
  

  
I am always glad to hear feedback on our team’s work, and I am particularly happy to share Angelica’s story.  Angelica reached out to our office because she and her husband needed help receiving their stimulus payments.  Our team was happy to step in: 
  

  
If you need help receiving your stimulus payments or navigating any federal agency, you can submit a request for help here.  Please do not hesitate to call me to share your thoughts and concerns or to let me know how my team and I can help.  You can email here, or call my office at (713) 353-8680 any time.
 
Best wishes, 


  

  

  
Last call: There are only a few days left to submit artwork for the Congressional Art Competition!  The deadline for our office to receive a student’s submission is May 7, 2020 at 11:59 PM.
 
This nation-wide high school arts competition is sponsored by the U.S. House of Representatives, and every year, talented young artists have produced beautiful pieces of art that reflect the diverse experiences of our district.

Dear Friend, 
It’s heartbreaking to see such violence taking place in Israel and the Palestinian Territories. Israel is one of our nation’s closest allies and we must do everything we can to help it pursue a permanent, diplomatic solution to this decades-long dispute.  Today, I urged the Biden Administration to help negotiate a ceasefire and restore peace in the region – and to make clear to both sides that the violence has to stop.  As these tensions continue to mount overseas, though, many of us here at home are still focused on trying to stop the spread of the coronavirus once and for all.  With the number of fully-vaccinated people in this country growing by the day, and the CDC taking steps to relax some of its own mask-wearing guidelines this week, there’s growing hope that things could finally start to return to normal soon.  As the chair of a key House subcommittee that oversees our nation’s health agencies, ensuring that we are doing everything we can to stop the spread of this virus has been one of my top priorities. A key part of that effort, though, is ensuring that our COVID-19 tests are as accurate as possible.  This week, I sent a letter to the head of the Dept. of Health and Human Services urging him to immediately reverse the Trump Administration’s policy that revoked the FDA’s power to review the accuracy of some COVID-19 tests before they are sent to market.  These tests remain one of our nation’s most critical tools needed to help end this pandemic, and ensuring that each and every one of them is as accurate as possible should be a top priority.  

Speaking of health care – the House this week passed a critical piece of legislation to protect pregnant workers from discrimination. This legislation, known as the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, will – for the first time – provide pregnant employees the protections they deserve and require that employers provide them appropriate accommodations during their pregnancies – such as appropriate seating, bathroom breaks, closer parking, flexible hours, appropriately sized uniforms and excusing them from strenuous activities.  No woman should ever have to choose between their family’s financial security and the health of their pregnancy. It’s important that the Senate take up and pass this bill immediately.  As a reminder, all Coloradans age 16 and over are now eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. To find out more about getting yourself, and your child vaccinated, please click here. 
As always, if you have any questions, or need anything at all, please don’t hesitate to contact my office at 303-844-4988, or visit my website at DeGette.House.Gov where you can learn more about all of the different ways that my staff is available to assist you.

1/29/21 18:23,More vaccine on the way,"Email not displaying correctly? Click here.





This week in Congress
January 29, 2021

	•	More vaccine on the way
	•	More money for schools, teachers
	•	Apprenticeships for the Marianas
	•	H.R. 560: permanent status for workers
	•	More time to respond to USCIS
	•	Veterans class on burn pits
	•	Kilili Time Capsule
	•	Opportunities
	•	Legislative highlights



More vaccine on the way

The Marianas will receive another 7,800 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in the first week of February, it was announced this week. This will bring the total doses of the Pfizer vaccine to 21,450. Each individual needs two doses, 21 days apart, for maximum effectiveness. The Marianas will also receive 3,200 doses of the Moderna vaccine in the February allocation, 33 percent more than January’s allocation, for a total of 8,200 doses. Moderna, too, requires two injections for full effect. The Moderna vaccine increase comes after the Biden Administration announced plans to purchase an additional 100 million doses of both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccine, increasing the total vaccine order for the U.S. from 400 million to 600 million doses. The announcement also pledged greater transparency in the vaccine distribution process. Vaccine distribution data by jurisdiction for both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines can now be viewed publicly on CDC’s website. 



More money for schools, teachers

One thing is for sure: schools will need more money from the federal government to help students make up lost instructional time and to pay teachers and staff in the middle of the continuing financial crunch that the Marianas and other state-level governments face because of the pandemic. This week I introduced a trio of bills to fill that need, along with colleagues on the Education and Labor Committee. Our Learning Recovery Act provides schools with funds to cover the cost of extending the school year, school days, or summer school to help students catch up on their learning. Our Save Education Jobs Act will deliver an estimated $50 million to pay Marianas Public School System teachers and staff in fiscal year 2021. And our Reopen and Rebuild America’s Schools Act provides $90 million for the Marianas to invest in the physical and digital infrastructure we need to get learning back on track.

H.R. 560: permanent status for workers

On Thursday, I reintroduced legislation to grant permanent status to certain Commonwealth-only Transitional Workers (CWs) and to foreign investors, who were originally admitted under Commonwealth immigration law. Similar legislation, also numbered H.R. 560, passed the House in the last Congress, but died in the Republican Senate. In addition to making long-term workers and investors eligible for permanent residence in the Marianas, the new Northern Mariana Islands Legal Residents Relief Act of 2021 gives those eligible for this permanent status under P.L. 116-24 another chance to apply and makes certain family members eligible, too. After five years, persons with Marianas permanent residence status could apply for U.S. permanent residence. The new H.R. 560 addresses concerns with implementation of P.L. 115-218, the Northern Mariana Islands U.S. Workforce Act, including clarifying congressional intent on touchback timing, extending the validity of an approved Commonwealth occupational survey, and increasing the time for CWs to apply for visas to enter the Marianas. My bill also ensures Marianas permanent residents and CWs can get relief and assistance in the aftermath of natural disasters. 



More time to respond to USCIS

On Thursday, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced another extension of time to respond to certain requests, notices, and decisions dated between March 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021. The agency will consider responses received within 60 calendar days after the due date stated in the document. Requests for Evidence (RFE), Continuations to Request Evidence (N-14), Notices of Intent to Deny, and Notices of Intent to Revoke, are among the eligible documents. Additionally, a Form I-290B received within 60 calendar days from the date of decision will also be considered, if the decision was made between March 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021. These accommodations are part of the agency’s continuing effort to minimize the impact of COVID 19 on immigration applicants.

Rep. Loudermilk Brings Transparency to Democrats' COVID ""Relief"" Bill
 

 
 
Press Release: Fed Chairman Expects Economy to Grow Despite Calls for a $1.9 Trillion ‘COVID’ Stimulus Package
 
 
Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-GA) issued the following statement after questioning the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, in today’s House Financial Services Committee hearing entitled Monetary Policy and the State of the Economy.

“Today, Chairman Powell publicly told me that the Fed expects the economy to grow ‘strongly’ this year. The growth could be as high as 6 percent, depending on how we respond to COVID [i.e., vaccines, treatments, etc.]. However, Speaker Pelosi is ramrodding through Congress the second largest spending bill in history, with almost $2 trillion of hardworking American taxpayer’s money.

Press Release: Only Hearing Reveals H.R. 1 is Unworkable for Election Administrators, Violates Free Speech, and Publicly Funds Congressional Campaigns
 
 
Committee on House Administration Republicans, Reps. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.), Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.), and Bryan Steil (R-Wisc.), reveal H.R. 1 is unworkable for election administrators, violates free speech, and publicly funds congressional campaigns during the only committee hearing on H.R. 1 before the bill heads to the floor next week.

“H.R.1 is an 800 page bill that strips the Constitutional authority for managing elections away from the states, and imposes unbelievable centralized federal control over our nation’s elections; but the Democrats don’t want the American people to know what’s in it,"" said Loudermilk. ""This massive bill was, by formality, assigned to eleven different House committees; but, Democrats have only mustered one two-hour hearing - in the House’s smallest committee - and without allowing for changes or amendments, nor even having a vote on it. Quite frankly, they do not want much attention on this bill, because if the experts and the American people knew what was in it, they would be outraged. If this was such a great piece of legislation, as they claim, they would not be afraid to have public input, deliberation, or at least a committee vote on it. Unfortunately, Nancy Pelosi has shown that she has no interest in following regular order, or abiding by House Rules regarding how legislation is passed. Once again, the American people are going to have a piece of legislation rammed through without anyone fully comprehending its impact.“

Wall Street Journal: 

""The Senate parliamentarian told lawmakers Thursday night that a proposed increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour didn’t comply with Senate rules, dealing a blow to Democrats’ efforts to include it in the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.

The parliamentarian, the neutral arbiter of the chamber’s rules, issued guidance saying she thought it didn’t meet the guidelines for reconciliation, the process that Democrats are using to pass their relief plan with a simple majority in the Senate, and would be ruled out of order.""

ABOUT BRADLEY | HOW CAN I HELP | CONTACT BRADLEY | WANT TO RECEIVE MY UPDATES?

 
Dear Friend, 
Beginning yesterday, the first Americans had the opportunity to be injected with a COVID-19 vaccine that has been deemed safe and effective by the FDA. A critical care nurse in Queens, NY was the first American to receive the Pfizer vaccine since it was granted an EUA. This historic moment was only made possible because of the efforts of Operation Warp Speed, which led the way in developing, manufacturing, and now distributing a vaccine in record time. 
Later this week, the FDA is expected to evaluate a vaccine candidate developed by Moderna, meaning that there could be two approved vaccines on the market by next week. While the virus is still a threat to vulnerable Americans, it's clear that the development and distribution of a safe and effective vaccine has moved the country closer to ultimately defeating COVID-19 and returning to normal life. Hang tough - we will get through this!  
We received good news last week that residents of Clarke, Dallas, Marengo, Mobile, Perry, Washington, and Wilcox counties are available for individual assistance related to Hurricane Zeta. I've been working closely with the White House, Governor Ivey, and other state and local officials to ensure this happened. Click here for information about applying for aid.  
Since my last newsletter, I had the great honor of giving my farewell speech on the floor of the House of Representatives. I spoke of my hope and optimism for the direction of our nation, what the American people have said in recent elections, and my thankfulness for the people of Southwest Alabama and other friends and supporters. My service continues until January 3, and I am confident Southwest Alabama will be represented well going forward by Congressman-elect Jerry Carl. Thank you to all of you for allowing me to serve! 
The Electoral College 
When the members of the Constitutional Convention in 1787 debated how to pick the executive, several options were considered.  Some wanted the people to directly elect the president, while others distrusted the people to know enough about the candidates to make that important decision on their own.  After all, the election would be held across the entire nation, and with the problems of communication in 18th century America it would be difficult for individual citizens to know enough to make an informed decision about candidates who lived nowhere near them.  But the Framers wanted the voters to play a role, and they compromised by giving the decision to electors equaling the number of representatives and senators for each state and empowering the legislatures of the states, whose members were and are popularly elected, to select the manner of appointing those electors.  So you and I don’t vote for the president directly.  Our state’s electors do.  While early on several state legislatures opted to pick the electors themselves, in modern times all state legislatures have voted to have their electors chosen by popular vote.  This week those electors met in their respective states and cast their votes.  The press reports Vice President Joe Biden received 306 votes and President Trump, my candidate, received 232 votes.  Press reports also indicate that in several states where the electors chose Biden, separate groups claimed to be the actual electors and voted for President Trump. 

 There has been a lot of discussion and dozens of audits, recounts, and lawsuits as to who were the legally chosen electors in those states.  Despite the hype in the media that these efforts challenging the initial election calls in several states undermine our system, the Electoral Count Act of 1887 actually provides for a time period for such actions.  Former Vice President Al Gore took advantage of this time period in 2000, challenging the election until mid-December.  Democrats challenged the Ohio electors pledged to President Bush in 2004, and many Democrats fought through the counting of the vote before a joint session of Congress in 2017, when President Trump was elected.  They even challenged the votes from Alabama.  Democrats have normalized post general election fights over presidential results.  I supported the Trump team’s efforts to get a fair and accurate count of all legal votes.  I joined in a “friend of the court” brief, along with 125 members of Congress, supporting the last ditch effort by Texas and other states, including Alabama, to get the Supreme Court to look into the fact that in several states a person or group other than the state legislature modified election laws ostensibly to accommodate voters in the middle of a pandemic.  Whatever the motivation for those modifications, they couldn’t be made by anyone other than the state legislatures; secretaries of state, state supreme courts, election commissions and even governors cannot do that under the Constitution.  Rather than rule on the merits, the Court dismissed the case because, it said, the states didn’t have standing to bring the suit.  None of President Trump’s Supreme Court appointees dissented.  The last step in the process, as spelled out by the Twelfth Amendment, is for the electors’ votes to be counted formally in a joint session of the new Congress on January 6, presided over by Vice President Pence.  The Electoral Count Act allows one or more members of the House or Senate to object to a given state’s electors, but only if at least one member of the other house joins in the objection in writing.  Then each house votes on the objection.  Democrats tried that in 2000, 2004 and 2016 but failed.  My friend and colleague Mo Brooks from Huntsville has said he intends to object to the electoral votes of five states that voted for Biden, but he will have to convince a senator to join with him.  So far, with only three weeks left, no senator or senator-elect has agreed to do so.  The other hurdle he faces is a Democrat majority in the House that will not vote to take away Biden votes and at least ten Republican senators who have said Biden is the winner.  As I will no longer be a member of the House on January 6, I won’t be voting on any objection.  But I will be a citizen and I believe it’s important for all of us to respect the system we follow in selecting a president, set in our Constitution and the Electoral Count Act.  That system has served us well for over 200 years and will continue to do so.  I will honor our system and our laws by accepting the election results as counted by Congress.  I hope we all will. 
House Passes Byrne’s Bill Renaming Fairhope Post Office for Jack Edwards 
I'm thankful the House passed my bill to rename the Fairhope post office the William “Jack” Jackson Edwards III Post Office Building. Jack is one of Alabama’s greatest public servants whose leadership in Washington and Alabama left an indelible mark. I thank my colleagues – many who remember Jack fondly for his service and remarkable accomplishments – for supporting my bill to bestow this honor to Jack’s memory. I appreciate Senator Shelby and Senator Jones for their help to now push the bill through the Senate and hopefully on to President Trump for his signature. 
Byrne: Closure of Spanish Fort Post Office is Breach of Public Trust 
The people of Spanish Fort deserve a post office. I’m incredibly frustrated by the way the USPS misled me, my staff, and city officials. Their actions throughout this process are a breach of public trust. Read my full statement here. 
What's Ahead 
We are expected to vote on an omnibus spending bill this week to fund the government through October of next year.  Negotiations continue on another coronavirus aid package, and it is possible this package could be included in the spending package or come to the floor as a separate vote.  McCarthy, Pelosi, McConnell, and Schumer have been meeting today trying to work out a deal, and Secretary Mnuchin has been speaking to them by phone.  I am hopeful a deal can be reached. 
As my tenure in the House draws to a close, we have begun the process of closing my offices in order to make preparations for Congressman-elect Jerry Carl. As such, I am no longer able to respond to individual constituent messages. If you are seeking help with a federal agency or any other casework matter, you should contact Senator Richard Shelby’s office. You can send his office an email online at shelby.senate.gov. Should you need immediate assistance from our office, please call us directly at 202-225-4931. It has been the honor of my life to represent the people of Southwest Alabama in Congress, and I am forever grateful to have been your voice in Washington. 
Stay in touch, 

Congressman Bradley Byrne

Friend,

Before heading back to Washington for votes last week, I had the opportunity to visit the Texas-Mexico border to see firsthand the scale of this ongoing humanitarian crisis. I appreciate you taking the time to stay up to date on my work both in Michigan's Third District and in Washington. Thanks for reading this week’s Monday Message!

MY TRIP TO THE SOUTHERN BORDER 


Last week, I joined my colleagues on the House Homeland Security Committee on a trip to the southern border. To say I’m shocked by the situation I witnessed is an understatement of epic proportions. This is a full-blown humanitarian crisis of our own making. The overwhelming numbers of migrants and unaccompanied minors have made it challenging for Customs and Border Protection and state officials to ensure the safety of those seeking asylum. You can read more details about my trip and what I saw here. 

MY FIRST FLOOR SPEECH IS IN THE BOOKS


I gave my first speech on the House floor last week! I voiced my support for H.R. 2430, a bill to extend the Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) authority to protect Americans from fentanyl-related substances. This authority is critical to law enforcement’s ability to keep these drugs off our streets. We must act on this by the May 6th deadline. House Democrats unfortunately blocked the measure, but we won't give up. Read more here. 

HOUSE PASSES THE FRAUD AND SCAM REDUCTION ACT


Last week I voted in favor of Rep. Walberg's (MI-07) bill, the Fraud and Scam Reduction Act. This legislation would help prevent scammers from targeting senior citizens. Unfortunately, we've seen a lot of fraud during the pandemic, and I am proud this bill passed the House with my support. Read the full bill here. 

PRIORITIZING STEM EDUCATION, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN MI-03


In last week's House Science, Space, and Technology Committee hearing, I highlighted the need for increased investment in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and our research enterprise. We must rise to the challenge posed by China and others who have copied our research ecosystem, stolen intellectual property, and boosted research and development investment. Read my full press release here. 

SHARING TWO OF LAST WEEK'S VIRTUAL MEETINGS





I met with Americans for the Arts last week. They are the nation's leading nonprofit for advancing the arts in America. We discussed how Congress can support creative industries in MI-03 and across the state.




It was great meeting with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. MI-03 is home to two zoos: John Ball Zoo in Grand Rapids and Binder Park Zoo in Battle Creek. We discussed some of the issues facing our community and zoos across our district and state.

4/9/21 19:59,Central Florida is Building Back Better!,"Dear friends and neighbors, 
 
Throughout the course of this pandemic, those on the frontlines have been bravely navigating the unexpected and extremely difficult circumstances presented by the virus. 
 
This week, the fruits of their labor and sacrifice continued to showcase themselves. On Monday, all Floridians 16 years of age and older became eligible to receive a vaccine against COVID-19. As we continue doing our part to advocate for more vaccination sites and increased funding for our state’s recovery, we encourage everyone to make a plan to get vaccinated. 
 
During a visit to Tallahassee, I had the opportunity to express the gratitude I feel towards our health care workers by speaking up in support of full funding of Florida's Medicaid program through the $10 billion provided by the recently-passed American Rescue Plan Act. It was great to discuss the investments we will make to rebuild our state after the COVID-19 pandemic and how we will uplift the public health programs that have responded to this unprecedented crisis. 
 
Finally, this eventful week was wrapped up with visits to health centers in our district to witness the amazing work that our health care workers are doing in our community. As we continue to see the benefits of the American Rescue Plan reflected in our district, it is clear that the resources provided by this bold relief package would make no impact without the expertise and dedication shown by our heroes on the frontlines. 
 
I am taken aback by the progress our nation has made and feel more hopeful than ever about Central Florida's return to prosperity! 

In the District (and in Tallahassee!)

Discussing the ARP with Valencia College Students
 

It was an honor to meet with Valencia College Student Government Association leaders to exchange ideas about relief funding under the American Rescue Plan. It is clear that our future is very bright! 
 

Advocating for Immigration Reform
 

I wrote an op-ed for the Orlando Sentinel to highlight our nation's pressing need to protect immigrant essential workers. In the state of Florida, there are 390,000 immigrant essential workers risking their lives in industries like agriculture, health care and food service. They are responsible for feeding America's families, and it is crucial for us to show our appreciation through real change in our federal immigration laws.

Participating in the Kissimmee Cattle Ride

 
 

The City of Kissimmee welcomed the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association while honoring the Osceola County ranching heritage at the annual cattle ride. This event is a staple in our district and it was great to be a part of the excitement. 
 

Meeting with Legislators and Union Leaders in Tallahassee

 

 
 

 

During a visit to our state capital, I met with state legislators, Commissioner of Agriculture Nikki Fried, and Florida AFL-CIO leaders. We discussed the $10 billion our state received from the American Rescue Plan Act to keep first responders on the job, fund our health care systems, invest in education, and so much more. 

As we navigate the funds provided by the act, it is important to have these conversations to ensure that we are doing everything in our power to identify the immediate and long term needs of Floridians, and allocate these resources to the areas of our state that need them the most. 
 

Witnessing Our District's COVID-19 Response Firsthand

 
 

At the BayCare Winter Haven Hospital, I met with frontline health care workers and heard about the impact the American Rescue Plan is having on their ability to save lives. I also visited Osceola Community Health Services to learn more about their vaccination efforts in our community. 

In Washington, D.C. 

Advocating for Full Funding of Florida's Medicaid Program
 

Along with members of the Florida Congressional delegation, I spoke out in favor of full funding of Florida's Medicaid program to protect our most vulnerable communities. It is important for us to support the health care workers that have worked tirelessly to get us through the pandemic.

12/16/20 19:59,"latest on the COVID-19 vaccines, and other updates","News from Representative Rouzer


December 16, 2020 
  
Dear Friend, 
Some good news items to report in today’s update: 
	•	Nearly seven months to the day after President Trump launched Operation Warp Speed, a safe, effective vaccine is now being administered to the American people.  As we speak, millions of doses of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine are being distributed around the country, utilizing plans months in the making developed by the Departments of Defense and Health and Human Services.  Earlier this week, the FDA said that Moderna, Inc.’s vaccine, which is still pending final approval, is “highly effective”, and said there were no specific safety concerns that would preclude the agency from authorizing the vaccine’s use.  This sets up Moderna’s vaccine candidate for authorization later this week, with delivery soon thereafter.  When President Trump said seven months ago that we would have a vaccine ready to deploy by the end of the year, many experts said it could never happen — that it would be a miracle.  Instead, we have one vaccine already being administered and another on the verge of approval by the FDA in the coming days.    This is nothing short of a triumph for President Trump, his administration, the scientists who developed and tested the vaccines and the countless Americans that are working to distribute and administer the vaccines.  
	•	Additionally, earlier this week the FDA approved the first truly at-home, over-the-counter COVID-19 diagnostic test.  The test, made by test manufacturer Ellume, will allow a patient to buy the test, administer it to themselves, and receive a result in as little as 20 minutes.  While it may take some time to ramp up production of the test to make it easily accessible to most Americans, this is another encouraging sign that American ingenuity, empowered by the Trump Administration’s policies, is leading the world in the fight against the virus.   
	•	Committee leaders in the House and the Senate have announced a bi-partisan agreement on legislation to protect patients from surprise medical bills and promote a fair, equitable process for resolving billing disputes between insurers and medical providers.  If approved by Congress, this will help prevent unsuspecting patients from getting stuck with enormous, unexpected medical bills after they receive treatment from an out-of-network provider.  Here’s one example of both parties coming together on important healthcare legislation.  We hope to pass this bill in both chambers this week.  For more information on the agreement, and how the legislation will protect patients from surprise medical bills, click here.   
	•	Negotiations between congressional leaders on a COVID relief package are close to wrapping up, and I expect we will have a package to vote on in the next several days. 
Sincerely,

Foxx Report
 
In America, we’ve created a tradition of assessing a President after his first 100 days in office – in particular, using those days as a barometer for what lies beyond the horizon for the country. In the case of President Biden, his 100-day mark came this week, and he rightfully deserves an F. I say this for two specific reasons: he has failed to address, let alone recognize, the crisis at the southern border and his spending plans will leave future generations with obscene levels of debt that will continue to pile up. Allow me to elaborate.
The American people deserve to have the truth laid at their feet regardless of the situation. This Administration has bucked numerous opportunities to openly acknowledge that there is a crisis at the southern border. This year alone, the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) have apprehended over 5,000 migrants with criminal convictions, there has been a 233% increase in fentanyl seizures, and a 400% increase in the number of migrants apprehended compared to March of 2020. What’s more, President Biden and Vice President Harris have not taken the time to see firsthand the situation unfolding at the border – a concerning message that must be corrected immediately. Their first step in solving this crisis is admitting that there is one.
The American Rescue Plan was touted by President Biden as “a strong foundation” for the country, but in fact, it fell far short of that promise. Only nine percent of the $2 trillion package went to combating the pandemic – with only one percent being allocated to additional vaccination efforts. Republicans were the ones to expose these facts in the first place. Unfortunately, Republicans were not allowed to fully participate in drafting this legislation, making it a one-sided approach that not only doesn’t meet the expectations of the American people, but also neglects bipartisanship and finding common ground in the process. Let me be clear, more wasteful spending will not help America get back on its feet, nor will it ease the burden that will lie on the shoulders of future generations for many years to come.
Though these are just two issues to focus on, there’s more that must be done, in a spirit of bipartisanship and in putting America first. A continued economic comeback, targeted improvements to infrastructure, a bolstered American workforce, and schools safely reopening must be placed atop the President’s list of priorities. Right now, the American people must see demonstrable action on the issues facing the country. Instead the Biden Administration seems obsessed with appeasing the far left or governing solely to cement its place in a history book. 
The Lower Costs, More Cures Act
In response to Speaker Pelosi’s attempted government takeover of prescription drug pricing through H.R. 3, I’ve joined my colleagues Representative McMorris Rodgers (R-WA) and Representative Kevin Brady (R-TX) in introducing the Lower Costs, More Cures Act. This legislation helps move America further away from its reliance on China, empowers patients with more drug price transparency, and cuts the cost of cancer treatments and the administration of other drugs for Medicare beneficiaries by as much as half. This is important news, and I’m proud to help lead the charge to provide the American people with lower drug costs without limiting access to lifesaving cures. Speaker Pelosi’s plan of putting the federal government in charge of setting the price of prescription drugs through H.R. 3 is unacceptable, and our legislation puts the power back in the hands of patients – where it rightfully belongs.
To read a detailed summary of the Lower Costs, More Cures Act, click here.
Our Letter to Governor Cooper
Recently, members of the North Carolina delegation sent a letter to Governor Cooper expressing our concerns over discussions of creating a so-called “vaccine passport” mandate in the state. Making such passports mandatory will signal to North Carolinians that their right to participate in the economic life of our state and the nation is in jeopardy. There is no circumstance under which government may infringe upon Americans’ constitutional liberties, not even in a global pandemic. Any facilitation from the federal or state government in providing or encouraging vaccine passports will politicize vaccination efforts.

Sponsored Legislation: This week, I introduced the following bills to the House of Representatives; 
	•	H.R.3461 - To amend title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act to improve health care coverage under vision and dental plans, and for other purposes;                                        Too often, dental and vision health care coverage is either critically neglected, or absent altogether. Access to proper dental and vision cannot be a privilege in America, especially considering the impact limited access poor care in these areas has on our country’s underserved and underrepresented communities. My bill would ensure the right to vision and dental healthcare coverage for every American, because it is a right. Full stop.
Co-Sponsored Legislation: This week, I lent my support and commitment to the following bills: 
	•	H.R. 3434;  Healthcare is, and always will be, a human right. I co-lead H.R. 3434, The Territories Health Equity Act of 2021, to protect Americans living in United States Territories. Read my full statement on H.R. 3434 below in today's newsletter.
	•	H.R. 3383;  This bill would provide $30 million in funding to improve elementary, middle, and high school civic engagement curriculums. I believe a healthy democracy begins with informed, passionate, dedicated citizens who care for their country and its continued success. H.R. 3383 would serve as a federal commitment towards the young people of this country as they transition into adults and inheritors of the future.
	•	H.R. 3407;  This bill would address America’s ongoing maternal health crisis, delivering crucial assistance to the women facing the risks of maternity and enabling state governments to enact a unified response in overcoming the crisis. In the 21st century, our country can do so much more to protect our new mothers as they experience childbirth. H.R. 3407 would do more.
	•	H.R. 3419;  This bill would designate the United States Postal Service facility located at 66 Meserole Avenue in Brooklyn, New York, as the ""Joseph R. Lentol Post Office"", after the former New York State Assemblymember. Joe Lentol proved to be a dedicated public servant and friend to Brooklyn throughout his tenure in the Assembly. For his contributions to our borough, our state, and our country, I can think of no better name to adorn this Brooklyn Post Office.
	•	H.R. 3423;  This bill would amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to replace drinking water fountains in public playgrounds, parks, and libraries to ensure they are healthy for our nation’s children to drink and enjoy. The availability of clean, safe water is non-negotiable. H.R. 3423 will keep our children safe from the dangers of toxic water consumption today and for years to come.
	•	H.R. 3474;  This bill aims to protect our students by banning the use of physically or mentally dangerous restraint techniques in any school receiving federal funding. With tens of thousands of students being victimized by these techniques every year, with disproportionately high usage on Black children and students with disabilities, it is paramount we ensure their security wherever we are able. H.R. 3474 would be a monumental step in keeping our students safe. 

 
Clarke and fellow Co-Chairs of Congressional Haiti Caucus issue statement on new 18-month Temporary Protected Status designation for Haitians living in the U.S.   As the chairs of the Haiti Caucus, we welcome President Biden’s decision to grant Haitians living in the United States Temporary Protected Status. It is wrong to force people to return to uncertain and dangerous conditions in Haiti. This necessary step that will protect Haitian migrants amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing political crisis in Haiti. We are deliberate in calling this a ‘step.’ The Biden administration should examine all of its policies concerning Haiti and act urgently on the requests outlined by House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Meeks, House Democratic Caucus Chairman Hakeem Jeffries, and dozens more Members on April 26. More action is needed to ensure the health, wellbeing and human rights of the Haitian people. We look forward to working in partnership with the Biden/Harris Administration to provide a permanent pathway to citizenship for TPS holders and build an immigration system that affirms the dignity and humanity of all people.  Clarke Issues Statement on H.R. 3434 Territories Health Equity Act of 2021   Healthcare is a human right, and the equitable distribution of that healthcare must be at the forefront of our legislative priorities on the mainland, and throughout the U.S. Wherever and whenever an opportunity exists to overcome these inequities, to protect and preserve an individual’s right to quality healthcare, we must seize it. I am proud to stand alongside Rep. Plaskett as she reintroduces this critically important legislation because let me be very clear, citizens of U.S. territories are Americans, and they deserve to be treated as such. Full stop. 
  

  

  
Our borough’s beloved Children’s Museum is giving back to its community once more by partnering with the City of New York to host a vaccination site at its location. From Tuesday through Saturday, from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm, until June 30th, the Pfizer vaccine will be available for free to all, ages 12 and beyond. No appointment necessary. Upon receiving a vaccination, the Museum is offering a complimentary family visit for all who are interested. To learn more on the vaccination process, please call (877) 829-4692.

12/13/20 21:48,Weekly Wrap Up,"Dear Neighbor,
This week saw the beginning of Hanukkah celebrations – to all those in our community observing, I would like to send you warm wishes during this festival of light! 

Here is an update looking back on a busy week and looking forward to the next:


I hope you will join me this Wednesday evening for my last telephone town hall of the year, where I will provide a brief update on my work.  I am also thrilled that Dr. Peter Hotez will join us to help answer questions on the most recent developments on the COVID-19 pandemic.   My Year-End Telephone Town Hall will take place this Wednesday, December 16, 2020 at 6:05pm. You can RSVP here or by clicking the link above to join.


I spent the last week in Washington, working with my colleagues to pass vital year-end legislation.  Among them, I am particularly glad the House passed the Senate-conferenced version of the Water Resources Development Act of 2020.  As you may recall, I worked at the Committee level to secure authorization for the Houston Ship Channel Expansion project in this bill, and I am glad to see this critical project one step closer to being signed into law. 



The House and the Senate also passed the National Defense Authorization Act, which includes several provisions to improve military readiness, increases pay for servicemembers, contains improvements to military housing, and requires members of federal law enforcement, Armed Forces, or the National Guard to visibly display their name and agency when responding to a civil disturbance.

In addition, we passed a Continuing Resolution to fund the government until December 18 and prevent a government shutdown.  Negotiators on both sides of the Capitol are continuing to negotiate a long-term funding package.  It is critical we do not allow the government to shut down in the middle of a pandemic.

The House voted and passed several other measures, among them H.R. 1570, legislation to eliminate the surprise bills associated with polyp removal that can help prevent colorectal cancer.  This is an issue that I have heard from our neighbors about from my very first town hall, and I’m glad the House has acted on this issue that is critical to so many.


Unfortunately, another week has passed without an agreement on the next COVID-19 relief bill.  I share the belief of many in our district that a new COVID relief package is not optional – we must do it to save from the most devastating economic impacts of the pandemic.  A number of different paths forward have been proposed, including options with strong bipartisan support, but they continue to be blocked in the Senate by Leader McConnell.  As Congressional leadership continues negotiations on COVID relief, I am continuing to push all sides to get this done, including ensuring that we provide small businesses with additional relief during this time.


This was a big week in the fight against the coronavirus.  On Thursday, the FDA Vaccine Advisory Panel voted to recommend the agency grant emergency use authorization to Pfizer for their vaccine, which was officially granted late Friday.  This is incredible news and a testament to the tireless efforts of scientific and medical communities.  Houston hospitals are expected to get the first shipments of COVID-19 vaccine on Monday.   There is light at the end of the tunnel, but we’re not through the crisis yet.  We know that the first to be vaccinated will be the frontline workers who continue to risk their own lives to treat and save the lives of those who have been infected, followed by those in high-risk categories.  It will take time before everyone can receive the vaccine, and until then we must continue our efforts to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe.  The positivity rate in Harris County is at 10.1 percent, and we remain at a Severe Threat Level for community spread.  TMC hospitals exceeded base ICU capacity for the first time since the summer surge, and a peak of hospitalizations is expected to come in the next couple of weeks. Nationally, we met another grim milestone, with the country reporting more than 3,000 deaths in one day this week.    It is imperative that we all do our part to slow the spread of this virus.  Wearing a mask, keeping physical distance, and washing our hands have been proven time and again the most effective method to slow the spread, and getting tested can help contain the spread.  You can visit http://covcheck.hctx.net to find your nearest testing site. 


Here are some important deadlines to keep in mind:
	•	ACA Marketplace: Those who need to sign up or change their ACA coverage have until this Tuesday, December 15, 2020 to do so. Start the process here.
	•	Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL): The final day to apply for a COVID-19 EIDL is December 31, 2020. Start the application process before the holidays.
	•	Hurricane Harvey Reimbursement: Homeowners who repaired their own homes following Hurricane Harvey have until Thursday, December 31, 2020 to apply for reimbursement through the Community Development Block Grant Disaster Recovery (CDBG-DR) program.  Homeowners can begin the process here. 



My team and I are here to help.  If you have any questions or concerns on any of the matters here – or anything else – you can reach us at (713) 353-8680 or by emailing me here.  I look forward to hearing from you!


Best wishes,

December 12, 2020 


As a country, we find ourselves at a pivotal moment in the fight against this pandemic and economic crisis. Coronavirus cases are surging, families are struggling to put food on the table, and small businesses are running on fumes. Nineteen million workers are receiving unemployment benefits and twenty-one percent of Americans are behind on rent. With no additional unemployment relief in sight and the federal eviction moratorium set to expire on December 31st, families will have nowhere to turn this holiday season. It would be unconscionable for the House and Senate to adjourn this month without completing a coronavirus emergency response bill. We have a chance to deliver on real relief right now and must move forward to pass a substantive package that shores up faltering small businesses, extends unemployment benefits, and gets emergency relief where it’s needed most.

Last week, members of the House and Senate announced a bipartisan proposal for a new COVID-19 package. I’m glad that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were able to come together and put a plan on the table, and I was pleased that many of Maryland’s priorities were included. This package makes important progress on provisions that will help Americans weather the storm this winter, including an extension on expanded unemployment benefits and the federal eviction moratorium, as well as rental and food assistance. It would also provide an infusion of funds to many of the programs that are key features of the bipartisan CARES Act like the Paycheck Protection Program (an improved version more targeted to those small businesses most in need) and aid to state and local governments to prevent layoffs of teachers and emergency personnel. In addition, the current plan includes necessary resources for testing, tracing, and vaccine distribution. 

Over the past few days, I have worked with my colleagues to include a number of provisions I’ve been fighting for since the beginning of the pandemic – including vital funding to extend economic relief for families and small businesses, help close the digital divide, support our transit systems, and bolster SNAP and other nutrition assistance programs. While it isn’t perfect and we still need to see more details on the final package, I believe this bipartisan plan offers an important framework for discussions so we can send a stopgap measure to the President’s desk and get our country through these tough winter months. Moving forward, the Biden-Harris Administration will need to work with Congress to deliver more relief to beat this pandemic and build back better.

The bipartisan stimulus plan holds potential for real compromise on emergency relief. But Republican Leader Mitch McConnell has already begun to throw cold water on this initiative. After refusing to hold a vote on the House-passed HEROES Act for over seven months, McConnell is once again blocking efforts to get emergency aid to the American people. And instead of engaging in good-faith negotiations, McConnell has been peddling his own partisan plan that puts big corporations first and gives tax breaks for three-martini lunches while leaving workers behind. Instead of collaborating with lawmakers, the Majority Leader has outsourced his leadership in Congress to the White House. McConnell’s current proposal is not only wholly inadequate – it is an effort to take advantage of this crisis to pass measures that will end up hurting the American people.

If Congress doesn’t pass a relief package fast, the economic situation could get much worse for families across our state and our country. As we continue working to fund the government by next week’s deadline, we must also include much-needed coronavirus relief in this year’s spending package and prevent crucial support programs from expiring. The government has a moral responsibility to deliver for the American people in a moment of crisis like this, and I won’t let up in this fight until we get a substantive bipartisan plan across the finish line.
