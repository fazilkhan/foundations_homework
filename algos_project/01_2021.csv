1/20/21,Reflections on this historic Inauguration Day,"Dear Friend: 	¬†  I wanted to share a few thoughts on this historic inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, and what the next one hundred days will look like. 	¬†    Four years ago, on the same platform, in a speech that was more prophesy than history, Donald Trump described an America in the throes of carnage. For better or worse, a President really sets the tone for the country, and for the last four years that tone has been one of bitter division and hate. 	¬†    The damage that Trump wrought has been immense, through dereliction of his duty to keep Americans safe and healthy, and through his disdain for the institutions of our democracy. His policies were characterized by cruelty ‚Äì towards immigrants, towards refugees, racial and religious minorities, and by indifference ‚Äî towards families struggling to get by and put food on the table. 	¬†    Today marked a new beginning. For a nation that never got to celebrate the new year, this was New Year's Day. Listening to President Biden‚Äôs inaugural address, I couldn‚Äôt help but feel optimistic about the future, about our nation‚Äôs endless ability to remake itself, to renew itself, to press on with hope for the future no matter how difficult the past. 	¬†    And I was struck by how wise a choice the country had made in picking Joe Biden, his fundamental goodness and decency, his sincere calls for unity, his experience with loss and recovery, his devotion to truth and dignity. 	¬†   	¬†    The lesson of the past four years has been a profound one ‚Äì our democracy is not self-effectuating. It is up to us, to every generation, to protect and defend it, to cherish and preserve it. As our new President said today: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve learned again that democracy is precious. Democracy is fragile. And at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed.‚Äù 	¬†    We are facing four crises that will test our nation in the coming weeks, months and years ‚Äì a crisis in health, in our economy, with our climate, and one crying out for racial justice. All of these challenges require urgent action, and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will devote themselves completely to helping us overcome. President Biden will be a president for all Americans, just as Harris will do the same. 	¬†    With 400,000 of our fellow citizens dead, our most urgent priority must be addressing the pandemic, which continues to devastate the nation every day. Today, President Biden is issuing a mask mandate on federal property and inter-state travel, and invoking a 100-day mask challenge for all Americans. The science is clear ‚Äì masks work, masks save lives, and this order will help us slow the spread until vaccines are fully deployed. Today, America will also rejoin the World Health Organization, as we rebuild our trust in science, and our standing on the global stage. Looking ahead, the ravages of the pandemic have only made the need for universal healthcare that much more clear and urgent. 	¬†    Coronavirus has brutalized our economy as well, as millions of American families struggle to pay rent, keep the lights and heat on, and put food on the table. That‚Äôs why President Biden will move to extend nationwide restrictions on home evictions and foreclosures and extend student loan payment deferral. But more relief will be needed ‚Äì urgently. When we passed the most recent COVID relief package, we knew it would only be a down payment on more relief to come. I support President Biden‚Äôs $1.9 trillion economic relief plan, which will provide critical funding to bolster our vaccine rollout, direct aid to families in dire need of support, and relief for small businesses. 	¬†    America faces other great crises as well, including the fight against climate change. Today, America is rejoining the Paris Climate Accords, and President Biden is signing an executive order to formulate a plan to achieve 100% clean energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050. This will be an ongoing priority for the administration, and I‚Äôm confident that Biden will make fighting climate change his enduring legacy ‚Äì the fate of the planet and our nation is at stake. Turning the tide on climate change will require bold action. With Biden, we will once again put our faith in science and lead the world in protecting our planet for generations to come. 	¬†    And we will need to finally begin to dismantle the systemic racism that has plagued our nation since its founding ‚Äì especially in the criminal justice system, but also by eliminating disparities in access to education, employment, health care, and more. President Biden and Vice President Harris have already announced the most diverse cabinet in American history, and I‚Äôm confident that, with a team that looks like and represents the vibrant diversity of America, we will begin the work of ensuring this nation lives up to its promise as a land of opportunity and equality for all. 	¬†    There is significant work to be done, but America has never shied away from a challenge just because it is hard. I am clear eyed about the long road to recovery, but after today‚Äôs inauguration, I‚Äôm feeling hopeful about our future. And I hope you are too. The process of renewal and restoration has begun at long last. America is resilient, and we build back better. That‚Äôs the American way. 	¬†  Stay safe and healthy,   	¬†  Congressman Adam Schiff",S001150
1/31/21 18:21,More help is on the way,"￼ 
Friends,   Here’s what I was up to this week: 
 

￼
ONE: Helping Jobless Americans Get Coverage
Over the last year, millions of Americans have lost their jobs because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and along with it, the health insurance coverage they need. For months, the Trump Administration refused my call to re-open the Affordable Care Act marketplaces so that families could access new health coverage options. Thankfully, this week President Biden did the commonsense thing and signed an executive order to do just that. Governor Murphy immediately followed suit by announcing that New Jersey’s marketplace at  GetCoveredNJ.nj.gov will remain open for enrollment until May 15, 2021. As we continue to battle COVID-19 and its economic fallout, no one should have to risk financial ruin as a result of getting sick. Visit GetCoveredNJ.nj.gov to learn more. 
 
￼
TWO: Increasing Vaccine Supply
This week, I joined Governor Murphy to tour the Meadowlands vaccination mega-site in Bergen County. It has the capacity to vaccinate up to 2,400 daily – but that largely depends on the availability of supply. While the President announced that vaccine distribution will increase by 16 percent next week, more must be done. That’s why Democrats are gearing up to pass a new, bigger, bolder COVID relief bill that not only puts money into the hands of struggling families and small businesses, but invests in the production and distribution of vaccines and other critical medical supplies. We are in a race against COVID-19 and we must do everything in our power to win this fight.
 
￼
THREE: Fighting to Restore Property Tax Deductions
In 2017, Republicans rammed corporate tax cuts through Congress on the backs of middle-class homeowners in New Jersey and across America by gutting the property tax deduction. It was wrong then, and it is wrong now. That’s why, this week, I joined my colleagues to introduce the SALT Deductibility Act to restore the state and local tax deduction and provide much-needed relief to homeowners. Allowing families to deduct their property taxes from their federal income tax bills saves them money and protects investments in things that matter to all of us – like education, infrastructure, public safety and more.

The Biden Administration's Immigration Policies
 
Last week, I sent a letter to David Pekoske the Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), on the Biden Administration's recent interim immigration enforcement and removal policies. One of these policies is a 100-day pause on deportations of any noncitizens, which violates the Sanctuary for American First Enactment (SAFE) Agreement. It is unacceptable that DHS’s new policy went into place within forty-eight hours, without gathering any feedback from local agencies and communities that signed the SAFE Agreement. One of the signers of this agreement is our own Sheriff Sam Page of the Rockingham County Sheriff’s Office in the Tenth District.  The SAFE Agreement not only helps to ensure immigration laws are being properly enforced, but it also ensures the safety of local law enforcement and the communities they serve and protect. Click here or on the image below to read the letter.

Giving People A Better Chance Of Achieving the American Dream
 
Earlier this week, I spoke about the importance of finding solutions for the millions of Americans who lack access to traditional credit. I believe there are a number of changes that should be implemented in the credit industry, such as increasing competition among companies and adding new ways to calculate credit scores. By doing these things, we can give people a better chance of achieving the American dream. Click here to learn more.

￼


President Biden's Coronavirus Relief Plan
 
I also joined Spectrum News to discuss President Biden's coronavirus relief plan. Additional, targeted relief is something that all of Congress could get behind. Unfortunately President Biden’s plan—which is universally supported by Congressional Democrats—is a partisan bill full of wasteful provisions having nothing to do with COVID-19.

Friends,

As many of you may know, Wednesday was International Holocaust Remembrance Day, a day when we remember the millions of innocent men, women and children who were murdered during one of the cruelest periods in human history. 

I found myself thinking a lot about Mrs. Erika Gold, an incredibly brave and inspiring woman who survived the Holocaust and now lives in Northeast Ohio. We met back in 2019. With hate crimes against our nation's Jewish communities on the rise, it is critical that we take days like this to assert that such evil has no place in our world. Stories like Erika’s must continue to be told to ensure we prevent the hatred that fuels anti-Semitism from taking root in our society.

￼
￼

My father was one of the brave members of our Armed Forces who risked his life to defeat the scourge of Nazism during World War II and I am proud to continue his fight against anti-Semitism in Congress.

As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I have repeatedly supported funding for the Non-Profit Security Grant Program, which provides at-risk organizations with funding for security enhancements. This funding helps houses of worship, such as synagogues, as well as community centers and schools save lives when dealing with threats to public safety. I'm pleased to report that this past December, I voted to double the funding provided for this important program for FY 2021. 

I remain committed to ensuring all Americans have the freedom to practice their religion peacefully without fear and will continue to proudly stand with Ohio’s Jewish community against all anti-Semitic threats.

Defending the Sanctity of Life


As a father and a lifelong Catholic, I believe wholeheartedly in the sanctity of life and am committed to defending it. That's why, since my first day in Congress, I have worked to protect the lives of the unborn.
￼

Earlier this week, I cosponsored the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act. This important legislation would ensure that infants born alive after a failed abortion receive the same protection of law and degree of care as any newborn. 

I find it abhorrent that in 2021 our country is debating the practice of infanticide. But rest assured, I will not fail our children when they're most vulnerable. 

Recognizing Our Nation's Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists

On Thursday, I was honored to introduce a resolution alongside my fellow Nursing Caucus Co-Chair to recognize the contributions of our nation’s certified registered nurse anesthetists (CRNAs) and their role in providing quality health care for the American people. 
￼

Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard and I are truly grateful for all that CRNAs do to ensure the highest levels of patient safety in anesthesia care. Their work has a critical impact in bringing down health care costs and increasing access to care. To read the resolution, click here or on the above photo.

Update on Ohio's Vaccination Program

As of January 25, Ohioans aged 75 and older as well as those with severe congenital, developmental and early onset medical disorders became eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.
￼

Know that Ohio's area agencies on aging stand ready to help older Ohioans learn about and access the vaccine. You can reach them at 1-866-243-5678. For more information, visit vaccine.coronavirus.ohio.gov. 

God bless and stay well,

Dave

1/31/21 13:30,An Update from Congressman David Kustoff,"
￼
￼

Dear Friends,

This week, I signed a letter to save the Hyde Amendment and protect the ban on taxpayer-funded abortions. Taxpayers should never be forced to use their hard-earned money to fund abortions. Learn more, here.
￼
￼

It's an honor to receive an A+ rating from the Susan B. Anthony List, one of the most distinguished pro-life organizations in the country. I will always back pro-life policies, vote to defund Planned Parenthood, and stand with the millions of Americans who fight every day for all unborn children.
￼
￼

Throughout my time in Congress, I have been working hard to promote pro-life policies. Below are a few of the many pro-life initiatives I have supported in this new Congress.
￼
￼

Wednesday was International Holocaust Remembrance Day. It is important we remember and honor the lives of the six million Jews and millions of other victims who perished at the hands of the evil Nazi regime. We must never forget the horrors that took place, and continue to pay tribute to the survivors who share their stories.

￼

Thank you to Tipton County Mayor Jeff Huffman for giving me an update on labor and economic development in Tipton County. I look forward to continuing our conversations about how we can best use the Megasite for future job growth in West Tennessee.
￼
￼

I enjoyed meeting with Covington Mayor Justin Hanson on Thursday to discuss how we can work together to grow Covington’s economy and come out from COVID-19 stronger. Thank you for taking time to sit-down with me.

￼

I met with Farm Bureau Insurance of Tennessee-Covington Agency Manager Michael Harris to discuss the effects COVID-19 has had on the insurance business and the Tennessee Farm Bureau. I appreciate you sitting down with me.

Rob’s Rundown: Week of January 25 – January 29, 2021  
Senator Portman announced on Monday morning that he would not seek another six-year term in the United States Senate when his current term expires in 2022.  
On Tuesday, Portman joined Fox News’s America’s Newsroom with Bill Hemmer and Dana Perino to discuss that decision and reiterated his commitment to being a fair and impartial juror who will listen to all of the facts during the impeachment proceedings that the Senate is expected to convene in February. Portman also  joined CNBC’s The News with Shepard Smith Thursday night to discuss the need for bipartisanship in the ongoing COVID-19 relief negotiations. 
On Thursday, Portman introduced Representative Marcia Fudge (D-OH) at the Senate Banking Committee hearing on her nomination to serve as Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Senator Portman and Representative Fudge have worked together on a number of issues for Ohioans, including efforts to combat the housing crisis in Ohio and across the nation, and he supports her confirmation. 
Finally, Portman spoke with Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan about his decision to forgo re-election, the upcoming impeachment trial, and his optimistic outlook for the future of the Republican party. 
For a more detailed look at Senator Portman’s week, please see the following: 
Monday, January 25, 2021 
Portman Statement on Political Future 
Portman issued the following statement announcing that he will not seek another six-year term in the United States Senate when his current term expires in 2022:  
""I feel fortunate to have been entrusted by the people of Ohio to represent them in the US Senate. Today, I am announcing that I have made a decision not to run again in 2022. 
""This doesn’t mean I’m leaving now – I still have two more years in my term and I intend to use that time to get a lot done. I will be the top Republican on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and I have a number of oversight projects and legislative initiatives I’m eager to get across the finish line. Over the next two years, I look forward to being able to focus all my energy on legislation and the challenges our country faces rather than on fundraising and campaigning.  
""This was not an easy decision because representing the people of Ohio has been an honor. But I’ve been doing this a long time, longer than I ever intended.  
""I’ve been in public service for 30 years – in the House of Representatives for 12, in the Executive Branch for about eight years in various roles in four different administrations, and in the Senate for the past 10 years. All this time, our family has kept our home in Ohio, where we raised our kids, and I have commuted back and forth to Washington. Jane and our three children have been 100 percent supportive, but I am really looking forward to being home in Ohio full time, seeing family and friends more, and getting back to the private sector, including being able to be more involved in the community and in our family business. And I plan to stay involved in public policy issues.  
""During my service in the Senate, I am proud of what we’ve been able to accomplish for Ohio and the country. I have consistently been named one of the most bipartisan Senators. I am proud of that and I will continue to reach out to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find common ground.  
""Eighty-two of my bills were signed into law by President Trump, and 68 were signed into law by President Obama. This includes impactful laws to address the drug addiction crisis like the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act that has saved lives by providing billions in new resources for evidence-based prevention, treatment and, for the first time ever, recovery services. It includes laws to confront the horrific crime of human trafficking. Working with trafficking victims, advocates, and law enforcement, my SESTA legislation has allowed victims to seek justice, and closed down websites that were trafficking girls and women online.  
""It includes laws to help workers, legislation that before the pandemic helped create one of the strongest economies in a generation, with significant wage growth for working families and the lowest poverty level ever recorded. I took a leadership role on tax reform and tax cuts, workforce training, regulatory relief and permitting reform. They all played a role in creating an opportunity economy and are key to getting us back on track. I have also been a leader on retirement security, technology policy, cybersecurity, trade, energy efficiency, prisoner reentry, National Parks, stopping China from stealing our technology, and more. I have worked constructively with my colleague, Senator Sherrod Brown, on matters that help move Ohio forward. 
""I don’t think any Senate office has been more successful in getting things done, but honestly, it has gotten harder and harder to break through the partisan gridlock and make progress on substantive policy, and that has contributed to my decision. 
""We live in an increasingly polarized country where members of both parties are being pushed further to the right and further to the left, and that means too few people who are actively looking to find common ground. This is not a new phenomenon, of course, but a problem that has gotten worse over the past few decades.  
""This is a tough time to be in public service. For many of the issues I am most passionate about, I will continue to make a difference outside of the Senate, beyond 2022. In the meantime, I am hopeful that President Biden will follow through on his inaugural pledge to reach across the aisle, and I am prepared to work with him and his administration if he does. I was on the bipartisan call yesterday on a new COVID-19 package. I hope the Administration will work with us on a more targeted approach that focuses on things like vaccine distribution, testing and getting kids back to school. 
""I want to thank the great people of Ohio for giving me the incredible opportunity to serve, and I look forward to continuing to work hard for them over the next two years. I appreciate my friends in every corner of Ohio and across the political spectrum who encourage me and help me better represent our diverse state. I thank them for what they do for our communities and for the inspiration they give me.  
""I want to thank my amazing staff both in Ohio and in DC. They work really hard for the people of Ohio and have enabled me to be so much more effective. I know I am biased, but I really believe they are the best team in the Senate, and others think that, too. 
""Of course, I will always be grateful to the voters of Ohio who have supported me in nine elections to the House and Senate. Thanks to them, I’ve never lost an election and never won by less than 18 points. I am confident that with their support I could have won again but, for me, the question was whether I wanted to serve an additional six years in the Senate.  
""I decided to make my announcement now because I have made up my mind, but also because it will allow whichever Republicans who choose to run plenty of time to gear up for a statewide race. 
""Finally, and most importantly, a special thanks to Jane and our family for the unconditional support and for the sacrifices they have made -- and will continue to make for the next two years. I appreciate Jane, Jed, Sara and Sally for being here today and for the well wishes from Will and Tyler who weren’t able to travel to Cincinnati this morning. We are a team.  
""In these next two years, I will continue to be actively engaged, doing my best to provide hope as we try to get through the devastating coronavirus pandemic and doing my best to help bring our great country together, to help us heal, so we address the many challenges we face together.""

On Fox News, Portman Discusses Future of the Republican Party & Upcoming Impeachment Trial in Senate 
On Fox News’s America’s Newsroom with Bill Hemmer and Dana Perino, Portman discussed his decision announced yesterday that he will not seek another six-year term in the United States Senate when his current term expires in 2022. In addition, Portman reiterated his commitment to being a fair and impartial juror who will listen to all of the facts during the impeachment proceedings that the Senate is expected to convene in February. 
A transcript of the interview can be found here and a video can be found here. 
Portman Statement on Senate Procedural Vote on Impeachment 
Portman issued the following statement on the Senate procedural vote regarding impeachment today:  
""I’ve been very clear that former President Trump bears some responsibility for what happened on January 6 through his words and actions. I will listen as a juror, but as I have said, I do have questions about the constitutionality of holding a Senate trial and removing from office someone who is now a private citizen. This is a serious constitutional question, and today I voted for allowing debate on this issue and against tabling this important discussion. As the trial moves forward, I will listen to the evidence presented by both sides and then make a judgment based on the Constitution and what I believe is in the best interests of the country.""

Portman Introduces Nominee for Secretary of Housing & Urban Development Marcia Fudge at Senate Banking Committee Hearing 
Portman introduced Representative Marcia Fudge (D-OH) at the Senate Banking Committee hearing on her nomination to serve as Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Senator Portman and Representative Fudge have worked together on a number of issues for Ohioans, including efforts to combat the housing crisis in Ohio and across the nation, and he supports her confirmation. 
A transcript of the introduction can be found here and a video can be found here. 
Portman, Colleagues Urge President Biden to Follow Good Government Practices Regarding President Trump’s Late-Term Federal Regulations 
Portman led a letter with Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Pat Toomey (R-PA), Marco Rubio (R-FL), Ron Johnson (R-WI), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Deb Fischer (R-NE), James Lankford (R-OK), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Ben Sasse (R-NE), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Todd Young (R-IN), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Rick Scott (R-FL), Roger Marshall, MD (R-KS), and Bill Hagerty (R-TN) urging President Biden to follow good government practices regarding late-term federal regulations put forward by President Trump’s administration, and reminding him that there are proper procedures in place to ensure both thoughtful rulemaking and oversight of those rules by Congress. Final rules that have completed the rulemaking process generally do not go into effect until at least 30 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register, or, in the case of a “major rule” as designated by the Congressional Review Act, at least 60 days after publishing. In the event his administration seeks to delay some of these late-term federal regulations from going into effect, such a change would require notice-and-comment and the regular procedures should not be short-circuited in the interest of expediency.
""Over the course of the campaign, and more recently post-election, some transition officials and congressional leadership have used rhetoric that raises concern with those of us committed to good government and the well-being of the American people.  It would be unwise to undo the achievements of the last several years with rushed actions that undermine the thoughtful regulatory reforms that have saved Americans $50 billion in regulatory costs…Absent action by Congress expressing its disapproval with any late-term rules issued by the outgoing administration, an incoming administration should carry out its duties and faithfully execute federal law—including by allowing lawfully issued final rules to go into effect,” said the senators.  
A copy of the letter is available here. 
Portman, Cardin Reintroduce Tax Credit to Encourage Revitalization of Distressed Homes 
Senators Portman and Ben Cardin (D-MD), both members of the Senate Finance Committee, have introduced legislation to revitalize housing in distressed neighborhoods in Ohio, Maryland, and nationwide. Cosponsors include Senators Chris Coons (D-DE) and Senate Finance Committee members Todd Young (R-IN), Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Tim Scott (R-SC).  Currently, private development lacks in some urban and rural areas because the cost of purchasing and renovating homes is greater than the value of the sale price of homes. The Neighborhood Homes Investment Act (NHIA) creates a federal tax credit that covers the cost between building or renovating a home in these areas and the price at which they can be sold. The NHIA would also help existing homeowners in these neighborhoods to renovate and stay in their homes.  
""The Neighborhood Homes Investment Act provides a tax credit to rehabilitate blighted homes and help revitalize neighborhoods across America and Ohio,"" said Senator Portman. “As we continue to battle the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, this tax credit will encourage opportunity and investment in neighborhoods that are often home to vulnerable populations and marked by stagnant housing markets, foreclosures, and blighted or vacant homes. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this new incentive which will work in tandem with the New Markets Tax Credit, Opportunity Zones, and the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit to help Ohioans by providing desirable housing and generating new opportunities for their residents."" 
On CNBC, Portman Discusses Need for Bipartisan Negotiations on COVID-19 Relief 
On CNBC’s The News with Sheperd Smith, Portman discussed the importance of working in a bipartisan manner on COVID-19 relief negotiations. Portman also discussed the upcoming impeachment trial, the need for leadership at the Department of Homeland Security, and his decision to not seek another six-year term in the United States Senate when his current term expires in 2022.

Rob Portman’s Exit Interview 
Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio isn’t running for re-election in 2022. This is not good. He is a rightly respected figure. He tries to advance serious legislation. He doesn’t spend all his time talking on television. 
He cheerily returned my call Wednesday from “the beautiful Russell Office Building.” He thinks his office was once that of Sen. Harry Truman; his previous office had been occupied by Truman’s frequent antagonist, Ohio’s Sen. Robert Taft. Mr. Portman finds this satisfying. In 11 years in the Senate, he has been known for a bipartisan approach.
Before being elected to the Senate in 2010 (by 18 points) and 2016 (by 21), Mr. Portman had six terms in the House and stints as director of the Office of Management and Budget and U.S. trade representative, both under President George W. Bush. He’s dexterously made his way through the party’s Trumpian minefields. Over the years when national events have turned especially murky, I’ve asked his read on things, and what’s always struck me is his stubborn sense of reality: He doesn’t let his wishes get in the way of what he sees. In the geography of the Republican Party he’d be placed with figures like Mitch Daniels —the We Actually Know Things Caucus.
When he made his announcement Monday, he said the Senate is too polarized, common ground has been lost. He has been moved by the response: “It’s a crazy world right now, and this decision I made I thought normal, but the response was abnormal. I think people are really yearning for some renewed bipartisanship and cooperation.” Potential candidates for his seat have called to say they want to be like him. “It’s been crazy,” he laughs, “like dying a good death.""
He’s 65 and means it when he says he wants more time with his family: “I never expected to be a career politician.” He intends to make progress “on the outside” on issues he cares about—drug addiction, sex trafficking, a commission on mandatory federal spending.
It really is something that we’re living in a time when ambitious people leave the U.S. Senate to get things done. 
On his party’s prospects he’s somewhere between bullish and serene. Everybody is talking about the inevitability of breakup, but he doesn’t see it that way. The 2020 election, he argues, showed Republican strength—gains in the state legislatures and the U.S. House. He thinks coming elections can bring out traditional Republicans and summon new ones. “There’s a meshing of the traditional GOP agenda—lower taxes, strong military—with more-populist approaches on, say, immigration, on trade. In the real world you have to have a fair trade system, and it’s not un-Republican to think so.""
An altered tone would help. “This does require leaders who have the ability to communicate these messages without the coarseness and the divisiveness that we have seen over the last four, five years."" 
He sees his state as a microcosm of the country. In 2020, “a lot of the pushback in the suburbs was style and personality. The suburban, more educated folks in Ohio, who are independent voters these days—you can win these areas if you’re focused on the right policies, and more welcoming and embracing.” Donald Trump did well among minorities: “That was about issues—the economy, small business, lower taxes.""
In spite of the smallness and rage various state GOP committees are displaying now, we agree in this space with Mr. Portman’s sense that in the long term it is issues that count. The potential health and durability of the GOP will be based on an integration of old and still-applicable stands with new and still-urgent ones. But that process won’t proceed easily with Mr. Trump as a dominant force. If he’s on the scene it’s back to the old battle lines, and everyone dug in.
On the upcoming impeachment trial: “I have said I will listen to both sides, and I will. I’m a juror.” But he believes trying a former president probably sets a bad precedent. 
I asked about the comment of his former campaign manager Corry Bliss, published Tuesday in National Journal, on Portman’s decision not to run: “If you want to spend all your time on Fox and be an a—h—, there’s never been a better time to serve. But if you want to spend your time being thoughtful and getting s— done, there’s never been a worse time to serve.” Mr. Portman roared with laughter. “Did he say that?” He roared again. “Yeah, I won’t comment.""
Here I switch away from Mr. Portman to squeeze in something being overlooked on the coming impeachment debate. 
I started the new year talking with an ambassador to the U.S. from a European nation, who spoke of Mr. Trump’s campaign to delegitimize the election. Do Americans understand the damage this does to U.S. allies, the ambassador asked. We look to you for an example of how to do democracy—you’re the oldest in the world! It grieves us to see the beacon of democracy sullied in this way. 
Those words rang in my ears five days later as I watched the Capitol besieged.
On “Axios on HBO” Sunday we will hear from President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. He is playing a hard hand. Russia is breathing down his neck, Republicans don’t want to hear about him because they’re embarrassed by the Trump phone call that triggered the first impeachment, and Democrats are embarrassed by Hunter Biden and Burisma. Mr. Zelensky seems kind of on his own, sitting on top of one of the world’s flashpoints. China has been sweetly reaching out.
Reporter Jonathan Swan asked the president how he felt as he saw the Capitol stormed. “Shocked,” Mr. Zelensky said. “I could not even imagine something like this was possible in the United States of America. . . . We are used to thinking that the U.S. has ideal democratic institutions where power is passed calmly, without war, without revolutions.” Such things happen elsewhere; they’ve happened in Ukraine. “That it could happen in the United States, no one expected that. . . . After something like this, I believe it would be very difficult for the world to see the United States as a symbol of democracy in the world.""
For more than a century we have claimed the mantle of world power, basked in the warm glow of our exceptionalism, and put ourselves forward as an example. When you do that you have responsibilities; you owe something in return. What you owe is the kind of admirable behavior that gives the world something to aim for. On 1/6 they saw the storming and the siege and thought: Ah, no stability in that place. We can’t learn how to do it there and replicate it here. 
This is a loss to rising democracies and also to us, to our standing and reputation. Senate conviction is the chance to show the world: No, we won’t have this; those who did it will pay the highest penalty.
It matters that all evidence be presented, that everyone sees we can come down like a hammer, ensuring that 1/6 was a regrettable incident, not a coming tendency. 
It matters that the world see this. That we see it.

GOP Ohio Sen. Portman not seeking reelection, cites gridlock 
Ohio Sen. Rob Portman said Monday that he won’t seek reelection to a third term in 2022, expressing dismay with the deep partisanship and dysfunction in American politics. 
The career establishment Republican with a reputation for bipartisanship cited a political climate that has made it “harder to break through the partisan gridlock and make progress."" 
""Our country is very polarized,” Portman said, adding that former President Donald Trump did not help with the polarization. “It’s shirts and skins right now. We need to tone it down."" 
The decision is one measure of the difficult politics facing many Republicans in Washington as they cede power in President Joe Biden’s administration and watch their party split between hard-right Trump supporters and others eager to turn the page. Portman, a moderate who might see growing influence as Biden looks for allies, did not appear optimistic about the prospect of a new political climate.
Portman, 65, is among the longtime Republican lawmakers who often backed Trump, though not vociferously. Once dubbed “The Loyal Soldier” in a front-page profile story in his hometown Cincinnati Enquirer, Portman usually defended Trump or avoided criticism of him with carefully worded statements. After Trump called the presidential election rigged, citing no legitimate evidence, Portman said Trump had a right to a probe of any irregularities.
But immediately after the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol by a violent mob of Trump backers, Portman said Trump needed to go on national TV to tell his supporters to refrain from violence. 
""Both in his words before the attack on the Capitol and in his actions afterward, President Trump bears some responsibility for what happened,” Portman said. 
His retirement adds another open seat for the GOP to defend in 2022 as it seeks to regain control of a Senate that Democrats hold by virtue of Vice President Kamala Harris being the tiebreaking vote. Sens. Richard Burr of North Carolina and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, two other more mainstream Republicans in the Senate GOP caucus, have also said they won’t seek reelection next year.
""There goes the kind of really thoughtful public official who listens, who works both sides, who tries to get things done,” Republican pollster Christine Matthews said. “And right now the kind of candidate that’s going to come out of a Ohio Republican primary is not going to be that kind of candidate. That’s not the kind of energy that’s in the Republican primary electorate right now.""
Indiana Sen. Todd Young, former chair of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said he wasn’t worried about moderates fleeing the party. 
""(Portman’s departure) says nothing about the 2022 landscape,” Young said. “It says a lot about Rob Portman that, two years out, he made the announcement so that Republicans have plenty of time to field a very strong candidate and to give that candidate sufficient time to run a strong campaign, which they will."" 
Eight-term Rep. Jim Jordan, an outspoken Trump supporter from western Ohio, and six-term Rep. Bill Johnson, from heavily pro-Trump southeast Ohio, are viewed as potential candidates for Portman’s seat. Likewise, former Rep. Jim Renacci from central Ohio, a Republican who lost a Senate challenge to Democrat Sherrod Brown in 2018, is also considered a possible contender.
Portman’s announcement came the same day that the Senate is receiving the House impeachment article against Trump for his role in the Capitol riot. While some Republican senators have criticized going ahead with the trial with Trump out of office, Portman said last week that he would listen to the evidence presented by both sides before deciding how to vote.
Republicans have 20 seats up for reelection in 2022, compared to 14 for Democrats. Those GOP seats include presidential battlegrounds Wisconsin, where Trump narrowly lost in November, and Florida, where he won by more than 3 percentage points.
Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson has not yet said whether he’ll seek a third term. Meanwhile, six-term Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, who would turn 89 two months before the 2022 election, said he would decide this year whether to seek a seventh. Two-term Missouri Republican Roy Blunt has not said whether he’ll seek a third.
Ohio, a perennial battleground for decades, has become more reliably Republican, carried by Trump by more than 8 percentage points in 2016 and 2020. Portman, like many mainstream GOP lawmakers viewed as insufficiently supportive of Trump, was considered likely to face a primary challenge from the right.
""Yeah, sure, some people are mad at him,” said Ohio Republican strategist Ryan Stubenrauch. “But he wouldn’t have faced a credible primary challenge. He does his job. He’s a really good campaigner and well known across the state.""
Portman twice won election to the Senate by wide margins. Before that, he served seven terms in the House and a stint as President George W. Bush’s budget director. 
Still, Portman’s departure offers a glimmer of hope for Democrats in the state. Besides Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, most other statewide officials are Republican. 
Tim Ryan, a 10-term Democratic representative from blue-collar eastern Ohio who ran unsuccessfully for the 2020 presidential nomination, said Monday that he is weighing a Senate campaign. “I haven’t made a decision yet but I’m looking seriously at it,” he wrote on Twitter.
Likewise, Dayton Mayor Nan Whaley, a rising star who lost a 2018 primary for governor, said she is weighing a Senate bid. “I’ve gotten a lot of encouragement, especially today, and will make my decision in the coming weeks,” Whaley told The Associated Press.
Portman’s first federal government job started in 1989, when he served as an associate legal counsel in the George H.W. Bush White House. Portman considered Bush a mentor, one whose genteel style was far from that of the abrasive Trump and some of his Republican supporters in Washington
Portman was elected to Congress from southern Ohio in a 1993 special election and won six more elections before President George W. Bush tapped him to serve as U.S. trade representative in 2005. He traveled the globe, negotiating dozens of trade agreements. Bush then nominated him to be White House budget director in 2006.

Restoring Justice and Unity to America

Dear Neighbor,

I pray that you and your loved ones are healthy and staying safe.

Our Constitution begins with the words ""We the People of the United States."" The voice of the people is the foundation from which all our freedoms take shape. We are a diverse country with many voices. Our disagreements are often heated. But through free and fair elections, we choose a path forward together. By working together, we can overcome the deadly challenges we face and build a stronger, fairer country.

We all know that the results in a democracy are not always what we want. But we are strong enough to overcome those disappointments, and find areas of agreement and compromise amidst our shared beliefs in respect, dignity, equality, and justice.

Earlier this month, violent insurrectionists inspired by lies told by the former president attacked the U.S. Capitol to overturn the results of the last election. Five people died, including a Capitol Police Officer, Brian D. Sicknick, who was beaten to death by the mob. I continue to pray for his family, and for our country.

One week later, I passed through the broken doors and shattered glass of the House Chamber and voted to impeach the former president for his role inciting that attack.

And one week after that, I had the honor to attend the inauguration of President Biden and Vice President Harris. As they took their oath to defend this nation against all enemies, foreign and domestic, we celebrated the triumph of the democratic transition of power and the strength of our republic. I had the pleasure to be joined by my husband, Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings, pictured below with my Central Florida colleagues, U.S. Reps. Stephanie Murphy and Darren Soto.

￼

We also celebrated the historic moment of Senator Harris' inauguration as the first female, Black, and Asian-American Vice President of the United States. Watching that moment reaffirmed my faith in America, and my parents’ promise to me that a little Black girl could do or be anything that anyone else could.

As we begin this year with a new congress and new administration, I am working with my colleagues and with the new administration on urgent legislation to bring relief to American families struggling with the virus and economic downturn, to make sure that vaccines are swiftly distributed to every American, and to rebuild America with greater liberty and justice for all people.

I believe in America. I believe that we can do anything if we honor our common values and treat every person with dignity and respect. As President Biden said in his inaugural address, ""we must meet this moment as the United States of America...We have never, ever, ever failed in America when we have acted together."" 

It is an honor and a privilege to serve and represent you. Please continue to care for one another and stay safe.

Our Republic at Risk

The deadly January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol was an attack on our democracy itself. The rabid mob, incited by lies told by the former president and his enablers, broke into the People’s House seeking to kill or capture the elected representatives of the people and to overturn an American election.

￼

If we saw this failed coup in another country, we would have no problem telling it like it is: a sign that our democratic system of government—our republic that has stood for 244 years—is in grave danger. To preserve our democracy, we must be brave and committed to our fundamental American values. 

To preserve our republic, we must respond to this deadly attack with the same seriousness as past generations who defended America in her hours of need. The perpetrators of the attack must be held accountable to the laws of our nation. Those who incited it by continuing to spread lies about “voter fraud” and veiled calls to “take back our country” must also be held accountable, up to and including the former president.

President Biden said in his inauguration that “disagreement must not lead to disunion,” and asked us to “end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal.” I echo the president’s call. We are better than those who try to tear us apart. We are one nation, and we believe in the same values: liberty and justice for all, and a better future for ourselves and our children. Those who seek to divide us and spread hate must be opposed with all our strength.

I am proud of the Capitol Police officers who, despite being put in an impossible position where they were outmanned and outgunned, managed through bravery and dedication to save many lives. I continue to support further investigations into how and why they were put in that situation. I pray for the families of Officer Brian Sicknick, Officer Howard Liebengood, and Officer Jeffrey Smith. 

Our republic is a precious thing. Our nation is not perfect, but we have always strived for perfection. The voice of the people is the means by which we ever seek a brighter horizon. When I took office, I pledged to defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic. I will keep that oath. We will never betray our constitution and our democracy.

Back to Work for the American People

I am honored to return to Washington, D.C. as your representative in Congress.

My top priority in the coming weeks is to pass meaningful COVID-19 relief legislation that puts money into your pocket and saves our struggling small businesses, ensures the stability of local government services like teachers and firefighters, and ensures that virus distribution will rapidly speed up so we can return to normal as soon as possible. President Biden has already signed multiple executive orders to move forward on these priorities, but only Congressional action can swiftly move the ball forward, and I again urge my colleagues in the Senate to join us and pass swift relief.

If you have not yet received your last economic impact payment of $600, please click here to track that payment.

￼

I will be rejoining the House Committees on Homeland Security, Intelligence, and the Judiciary. As we work to restore and unite America, it is more important than ever that we defend the Constitution, rule of law, and civil rights and personal safety of all.

In the last Congress, we passed comprehensive legislation on numerous issues, from civil rights, to climate change, to job creation, to health care costs. Nearly all of this legislation was blocked by the then-GOP controlled Senate, but now we have a chance to make important changes on these priorities. I am anxious to get back to work.

Celebrating 100 Years

It is my great pleasure to recognize Mr. Arlo Skjegstad of Winter Garden, who turned 100 years old this month!

￼

A U.S. Army veteran and retired plumber, Mr. Skjegstad moved to Florida from Minnesota, and was the first-ever resident of Trailer City, Winter Garden to reach the age of 100. When asked, he said that one of the great thrills of his life was learning to fly planes. Birthdays are blessings, and Mr. Arlo Skjegstad has been greatly blessed. Happy birthday!

----------

During this tough time, I want to assure you that my staff and I are still working and ready to assist you. If you need help, please let us know. You can contact us here.

It is an honor and a privilege to serve and represent you. Please continue to care for one another and stay safe. I know that we can get through this together.

Sincerely,

Friends, 
Thank you to everyone who joined the telephone town hall on Monday. We had the opportunity to talk about the vaccine, impeachment, infrastructure, immigration, and more! It was great to hear from you all, and it’s an honor to represent you!
 

 
 
No Asylum for Criminals Act
 
 
This week I cosponsored the No Asylum for Criminals Act. President Biden has pledged to unwind most of the Trump Administration immigration reforms, including granting amnesty to over 11 million illegal aliens, leading to a surge of illegal immigration at our Southern Border.
Our Asylum system is already backlogged with nearly one million cases. The No Asylum for Criminals Act would codify and strengthen Trump Administration reforms to the asylum system by disqualifying criminals from eligibility. It is increasingly necessary to stem the tide of illegal entry and to stop rewarding unlawful behavior.
 

 
 
Anti Rioting Legislation
 
 
Thursday I signed onto to anti rioting legislation, The David Dorn Act and The Patrick Underwood Federal Law Enforcement Protection Act. This legislation will increase penalties for rioting and for assaulting a federal officer. Law Enforcement needs our support now more than ever, and I am proud to back our Heroes in Blue.

Coronavirus Vaccine
 
 
Starting next week, South Carolina will receive 10,000 more weekly first doses of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine than it has been getting to this point. Vaccinations in the US began December 14 with health-care workers, and so far 25.6 million shots have been given. In the last week, an average of 1.21 million doses per day were administered. So far, 548,250 South Carolinians have been vaccinated. 
For updates on the vaccine, click here.
 

 
 
Marching for Life
 
 
Today and every day I am proud to stand up for life. With a radical agenda from the left, the pro-life movement is more important than ever. Every life is a gift and I will continue to be a strong voice for the voiceless in Congress! #ThisIsWhyWeMarch
 





Have a great week!

Sincerely,

Tom Rice

1/31/21 11:43,Let's talk vaccines.," ￼    ￼   ￼

￼
I’ve been hearing from folks in every corner of our state about one thing—the coronavirus vaccine. The science shows this vaccine is a safe and effective tool in the fight to manage the spread of this virus and get folks back to work. 
So when it comes to the vaccine, the goal is simple—get as many shots in as many folks’ arms as quickly and safely as possible. That’s why I fought to secure more than $10 billion for vaccine development and distribution. As vaccines continue to roll out, I'll keep working to ensure our state gets our fair share of the supply.
From the White House all the way to your local pharmacy, the distribution effort is a big job. And after inheriting a dysfunctional operation from the previous Administration, President Biden is taking important steps to ramp up vaccine distribution. I’ll be holding him and his Administration accountable every step of the way to ensure that every Montanan, no matter who they are or where they live, has access to a vaccine.

We must remember we aren’t out of the woods yet. Vaccinated or not, it’s important that we all continue to follow the guidelines that help reduce the spread of coronavirus and protect our friends and neighbors. That includes: 
	•	Wearing a mask while out in public and indoors with folks not in your household.
	•	Maintaining a distance of 6 feet from folks outside your home.
	•	Washing your hands frequently.
	•	Staying home if you’re feeling sick.
	•	Following local public health guidance.
As always, please don't hesitate to contact my office for assistance. Stay safe and be well.

CONGRESSWOMAN MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR'S WEEKLY UPDATE

This week, I received my Committee assignments. I am so proud to share with you all that I will represent our community on the key House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the House Committee on Small Business. 

On the Foreign Affairs Committee, I will fight tirelessly for our American values of freedom, democracy, and respect for Human Rights. Pursue sanctions against the brutal regimes in Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua and strengthen our relationships with our allies and regional partners like Israel, Colombia, and Taiwan. 

On the Small Business Committee, I am absolutely committed to working in a bipartisan fashion to assist our struggling small business owners and deliver COVID-19 relief as soon as possible. From Flagler St to Calle Ocho and from Collins Avenue to Miracle Mile, our small businesses have been seriously impacted by the pandemic and I will never stop fighting for our local job creators. 

I look forward to continue addressing your cases, reading your letters, and responding to your comments on Social Media. Please continue to let me know what your thoughts are and never hesitate to reach out to my office. My team is more than happy to assist you with any of your concerns and guide you through any challenges you may have with our federal agencies. 

It is truly the honor of a lifetime to fight for YOU in the halls of Congress.

1/31/21 10:31,A New Process for Vaccinating Seniors and Survey Results,"
 
 
 

January 31, 2021
 

Dear Neighbor, 

After the Speaker rescheduled votes in Washington, D.C. last week, I remained here in the district working on your behalf. I was also able to conduct a few site visits and meet with several constituents, which was time well spent. I always get the best ideas for how to help our community by hearing directly from you. 

We did have our first virtual meeting of the Energy and Commerce Committee last week. I am excited by the work we will be doing this term in the areas of healthcare, consumer protection, and technology. I hope we will be able to find bipartisan, common ground on these important issues. 

Unfortunately, President Biden's actions over the past two weeks through Executive Order have not reflected a willingness to seek common ground. His repeal of previous restrictions which kept our tax dollars from being spent on abortions performed around the globe is highly partisan. Additionally, his ban on new oil and gas exploration on federal lands and waters will hurt domestic energy production, cost American jobs and cause energy prices to soar. These measures continue to divide us rather than helping us to unite around common goals. 

I am committed to finding shared, bipartisan goals that will help all Americans. I would like to thank everyone who participated in my survey last week to let me know which issues you would like to see prioritized this Congress. The top results included:

	•	Preserving Constitutionally-Protected Rights, 
	•	Seeking Bipartisan Solutions to Challenges, 
	•	Protecting Veterans, 
	•	Fixing the COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution Process, and
	•	Modernizing the Supply Chain 

You can be assured that your feedback will help guide my efforts this term. Please continue reading for some important information.  
 

Protecting Seniors 

Update on Vaccinations 

Many of you have shared the frustrating experiences you encountered as you tried to register for a vaccine over the past few weeks. I've provided that feedback to those in charge of the state process. In response, I was really excited to see the state roll out a new system on Friday. While there are still implementation issues to work through, I am optimistic that this will eventually alleviate much of the frustration that seniors have encountered.

The state launched a new pre-registration system to schedule COVID-19 vaccine appointments for individuals 65 and older and frontline health care workers. Individuals throughout the state can pre-register for vaccine appointments by visiting this website. Each county also has a designated phone number that individuals can use to pre-register if they do not have internet access. You can find the complete list of numbers here. When you pre-register through the new statewide system, your place in line will be reliably reserved, and you will be contacted when it is time for you to receive your vaccine. This is a dramatic improvement. 

This new statewide system is different from the individual registration systems used by various county health departments. Residents can still use each county's health department registration process to try to secure appointment slots as they are released. Pasco County is releasing more appointment slots at 2:00 p.m. today. In order to try to get an appointment through Pasco County, you have to use the county's registration system (not the new statewide system). 

There has also been a lot of conversation recently about the rate at which Florida has vaccinated seniors. I was glad to read the Governor’s response to recent insinuation that our state wasn’t vaccinating seniors as quickly as possible. I have been clear that I do believe there are improvements the state can make. However, when reviewing all of the pertinent data, including reporting differences between the state and federal government tracking systems, it is quite obvious that Florida needs more doses of vaccine in order to improve the speed at which seniors are able to get vaccinated. I will continue to work in a bipartisan manner with other Members of the Congressional Delegation to ensure Florida has the support it needs as production of the vaccine continues to ramp up.  
 
Please know, I will continue to do everything within my power to advocate for you. 
 

We’ve also seen throughout the pandemic that telehealth services have provided a critical lifeline for millions of Americans, especially seniors, allowing them to receive quality medical and behavioral healthcare from the comfort and safety of their homes. Last week, my colleague and I refiled the ACCESS Act, critical legislation which builds upon those lessons learned by ensuring that seniors in long-term care facilities have access to and are able to enjoy the benefits of telemedicine. 
 

Additionally, studies have shown the negative effect that isolation has had on many seniors throughout the pandemic. I am glad to see the Hudson CARES Senior Center is offering safe opportunities for local seniors to re-engage in activities that promote socialization.  
 
 

Expanding Access to Quality Healthcare

Last week, I had the pleasure of touring the Community Health Center of Pinellas’s expanded new facility. It is simply magnificent. Federally-Qualified Community Health Centers (FQHCs) provide high quality primary care, dental and behavioral health services on a sliding fee scale basis. They treat the insured, uninsured and underinsured, and by law- patients comprise at least half of the membership for each FQHC’s Boards of Directors. This is part of what is working in our healthcare system and I want to expand this invaluable resource in our community.  Click here to learn more about my visit. 
 
 

Facilitating Economic Recovery
 
The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) is once again open to help provide relief to small businesses. The program is accepting applications for first time borrowers and 2nd draws for small businesses with less than 300 employees that have experienced significant revenue loss during the pandemic. We've clarified the steps which must be taken for these loans to be forgiven. Additionally, the loans are now tax deductible. So far in this newest round of funding, 19,425 loans have been approved for small businesses in Florida, totaling just over $1.5 billion in program assistance. Small business owners may apply through their local lenders.
 

Also, while we must continue working to rebuild our economy, it is great to see the Tampa Bay housing market booming. 
 
 

Investing in Education
 
Last week we recognized National School Choice Week. It is great for parents and students to have the option to choose which educational environment is the right fit for their family. Whether they choose a traditional public, magnet, charter, private, online or brick and mortar school, I want all children to have access to a high quality, safe learning environment that meets their needs. I am grateful to all the wonderful educators who make that happen. An investment in education is a sound investment in the future of our society. 
 
 

Fighting Addiction 
 
I have just received the 2020 Overdose Report for Pasco County, the results of which are very troubling. The pandemic has only exacerbated what was already a very significant problem in our community, with overdoses and deaths spiking during 2020. This problem impacts people of all ages, genders, ethnicity and socio-economic background. We must continue to provide access to treatment so that those who are willing can get the help they need.  
 
 

Advocating for our Heroes
 
I’ve re-introduced the Retired Pay Restoration Act (H.R. 303), legislation allowing Veterans to receive both military retired pay and VA disability compensation. The men and women who dedicated their lives to serving our nation should be compensated fairly for their sacrifices. My legislation would ensure Veterans who receive retirement payments following their military service can also receive disability payments from the VA. Under current law, many Veterans with service-connected injuries have their disability pay deducted from their retirement pay—even though they are completely different benefits. The Retired Pay Restoration Act would make sure these two benefits do not count against each other. Our Veterans deserve all of the benefits they were promised, and I will not stop fighting to rectify this injustice.
 

Also, congratulations to my constituent who lives in Pasco County, Kimberly Demers, on receiving the Department of Defense’s Patriot Award. It is great to see employers supporting our reservists when they are called to duty and helping to ensure a smooth transition upon their return to work. Also a special thank you to Major Kathy Lowe, an Army Reservist and local E.R. nurse, for her front line efforts throughout the pandemic. 
 
 

Consumer Protection Connection
 
ICYMI- As noted in this article, I was excited to recently be named the Lead Republican on the Consumer Protection and Commerce (CPC) Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. I look forward to working in this new role to help protect all Americans from predatory scams, investigate potential social media monopolies, encourage and spur innovation of emerging technologies, and defend against security breaches involving sensitive consumer data. This position also provides a unique opportunity to help the travel and tourism industry - which is vital to Florida’s economy and job market - as it seeks to fully rebound from the global pandemic. As always, my constituents can be assured that I will remain focused on ensuring quality and affordable healthcare options for all Americans and that I will never stop advocating for our nation’s heroes, as well as seniors and the disabled. 
 
Pro-Tip
 
Employers sending out W-2 Forms this month marks the start of tax season. It is important to remember that identity theft is a real concern, especially this time of year. If thieves have the right information, they can file a fraudulent tax return as early as January 20th and beat the legitimate taxpayer to his/her refund. Here are some important tips to help protect your identify. 
 
	•	Safeguard sensitive, personally-identifiable information throughout the year. 
	•	Taxpayers who file their returns online using shared wireless networks are at greater risk. If possible, use a private network when filing online. 
	•	File your tax return as early as possible to help prevent tax-related identity theft. 
	•	Shred copies of your tax return, drafts, or calculation sheets you no longer need. 
	•	Respond to all mail from the IRS as soon as possible.
	•	Verify any emails or texts claiming to be from the IRS before responding to them by calling the local IRS office directly. 
	•	Research a tax preparer thoroughly before you hand over personal information.
	•	Check your credit report at least once a year for free to make sure no other accounts have been opened in your name.
 
If you do find yourself a victim of this crime, please reach out to my office so my team can connect you with a Taxpayer Advocate who can help.  
 
 

Community Concentration 
 
My team enjoyed attending the recent Grand Opening of Flawless by Inathe, Skin Firming and Lipo Laser at its new location in Palm Harbor. Congratulations to Inathe and her team. It is always great to see small businesses growing. 
 

Congratulations to the Rivera Family of New Port Richey who recently received the keys to their new home through their participation in the Habitat for Humanity program. My team was proud to participate in the dedication and enjoyed celebrating this major milestone with the community!
 

My Aide, Bob Hatfield, recently had the privilege of speaking to the East Pasco Networking Group about the constituent services available to the community through my office. I have a team of talented caseworkers who work tirelessly to advocate for constituents when they encounter a problem with a federal government agency or program. We are here to help cut through the red tape. Mr. Hatfield also discussed the work we are doing in D.C. to restore our way of life, rebuild our economy, and renew the American Dream.
 

Additionally, my team was honored to participate in the POW/MIA Flag Dedication Ceremony recently held at the Elfers Senior Center. We will never forget our heroes! During the same ceremony, a new United States Flag was also dedicated. 
 

It’s also wonderful to see this partnership, which will benefit youth in West Pasco while fostering a love of hockey. It’s truly a win/win for kids in the area. Tampa Bay is lucky to have a community partner like the Lightning!  
 

Constituent Corner

I recently received this message from a senior in my district. 

I want to thank you for sharing information on your Facebook site about when I could log on and select an appointment to get my vaccine. I did exactly as instructed- with the help of my daughter who is better at the internet than me. I was able to sign up for a vaccine last week and now I am scheduled for my second shot. I kept hearing confusing things on tv about when and where to go but your information was straightforward. I'm excited to be able to see my grandchildren again soon. 

This is just one example of the work we do each day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!

Sincerely,
 

Gus Bilirakis

THIS WEEK ON BUDDY'S BRIEFING

This week, House Democrats transmitted the Article of Impeachment against former President Trump to the Senate. In the first days of the Biden Administration and as Democrats take control of the House and Senate, Washington Democrats have been presented with a great opportunity to work for the American people. Instead, they are wasting time impeaching a President who has already left office.

Also this week, I sent a letter with 199 of my Republican colleagues to Congressional leadership showing our unified opposition to efforts to repeal the Hyde Amendment. The Hyde Amendment prevents federal funds from paying for abortion and it has had long-time bipartisan support. We cannot allow the Hyde Amendment and other important pro-life safeguards to be decimated by Congressional Democrats.

We discuss this and President Biden's first full week in office in this episode of Buddy's Briefing.

COMBATING PANDEMIC SCAMS

As the world faces the COVID-19 pandemic, criminals are using it as an opportunity to exploit those most vulnerable through new and innovative scams. Check out my op-ed on combating these scams in The Hill.

Combating Pandemic Scams

COVID-19 has touched nearly every person on the planet. In response to the virus, Americans transitioned to work from home, cities effectively shut down, and millions of people lost their jobs.

Unfortunately, as this was all happening, criminals saw this as an opportunity to exploit those most vulnerable through new and innovative scams.

As Americans placed orders for personal protective equipment (PPE), they rightfully expected the items to resemble the pictures on the listing. Instead, they received different or defective PPE in the middle of a global pandemic.

While China worked to limit the PPE available to Americans, its counterfeit goods flooded our markets through e-commerce platforms. Since the start of the pandemic, the Department of Homeland Security has made over 1,600 seizures of fake medical products.

Now, as vaccines are being distributed, it is as important as ever that the American people have faith in the vaccines. However, there are already reports that scammers are offering people fakes and improper opportunities to jump the line to receive it.

Taking advantage of people during a global pandemic is abhorrent, and to address this, I introduced the Combating Pandemic Scams Act to help prepare and inform the public about these scams, and it was recently signed into law. Now, Americans can be educated on how to lookout for the scams and avoid them to save lives and money. To do this, the law requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to establish an easily accessible database for Americans to access and requires the FTC to disseminate this information to the public. That includes making it easily accessible for seniors and those with disabilities.

According to the FTC, over 140,000 complaints have been filed regarding pandemic-related scams. The FTC is responding to and going after these scammers, but educating the public on the types of scams and how to avoid them can provide an additional layer of protection.

The FTC’s data shows that online shopping ranks first in scams, vacation and travel ranks second and dietary products are a distant third. This reflects the growing trend of online shopping as people spend more time at home. As these online purchases grow, so must the vigilance of people to spot and report scams.

Pandemic scams aren’t limited to any specific area of the country. In fact, Georgia has had more than 6,800 fraud cases reported at a cost of nearly $5 million. Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr released an announcement in May detailing specific scams that were increasing in frequency, specifically contact tracing, stimulus funding, and working from home ploys. These are scams that have been seen across the country, with many Americans falling victim and compromising their personal information and finances.

We, as a country, have been through a lot as we have grappled with the pandemic and its ensuing effects. The last thing someone should have to worry about is whether or not they are being scammed as they try to get COVID relief funding or needed PPE.

People must have faith that what they are buying is authentic, and now that it’s law, I’m confident the Combating Pandemic Scams Act will help achieve this.

Scammers will continue to evolve their practices, but with a little assistance we can help the American public adapt. Together, we can fight back.

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCXCVII

Monday, January 25, 2021:  After driving up from Pooler yesterday afternoon, I’m in the Fox studios in Atlanta this morning where I have a live interview on Mornings with Maria on Fox Business as I discuss the COVID-19 vaccine, climate change and President Biden’s executive order suspending construction of the Keystone XL pipeline.

After a very productive meeting, I head to Gwinnett County where I meet with my good friend, Rick Desai, a very prominent businessman and leader in the Hindu community.  

Tuesday, January 26, 2021:  After making the drive back home yesterday, I start my day off with an early morning radio interview on Julie Mason Mornings on Sirius XM POTUS channel as we discuss scams, impeachment and climate change.  A link to my radio interview can be found here.  Next, I head to our Savannah office where I have a phone interview with Reuters to discuss the electoral vote certifications on January 6th and afterwards, I join in on our daily all-staff conference call. 
￼
Rep. Carter participates in a Politico panel on Artificial Intelligence
Afterwards, I am honored to join a distinguished group of experts on a virtual Politico panel where we discuss the ethical line on Artificial Intelligence (AI).  A link to the discussion can be found here.  

Wednesday, January 27, 2021:  I join in on a GOP Conference call this morning as we discuss a number of issues that are before our conference at this time.  Later in the afternoon, I have an Energy and Commerce (E&C) Committee Republican virtual member meeting as we prepare for tomorrow’s full committee organizational meeting.  

Thursday, January 28, 2021:  After traveling to our Savannah office this morning, I join in on an Aspen Institute virtual meeting where we hear from former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, who served under President George W. Bush from 2006-2009 and led the response to the financial crisis of 2008.  Sec. Paulson designed the Strategic Economic Dialogue to revitalize U.S.-China relations, and achieved major breakthroughs on currency manipulation, trade flows, the environment, food and product safety, and global financial stability. Today we discuss the current U.S.-China relationship and what can be done to reverse the negative trend based on mutual economic and environmental interests.  After our daily all-staff conference call, I join in on the Richmond Hill-Bryan County Chamber of Commerce virtual annual meeting to learn about all the great things going on in this vibrant and rapidly growing community.  Next, I join in on our E&C full committee organizational meeting for the 117th Congress and afterwards have a phone interview with The Current to discuss the upcoming 50th anniversary of the Thiokol munitions factory explosion in Camden County.  This tragic event, where 29 people were killed and over 50 injured, still haunts this close-knit community.

Rep. Carter on a call with the Patients and Providers for Medical Nutrition Equity Coalition
Next, I head to Wright Square in downtown Savannah where I film this week’s edition of Buddy’s Briefing in front of the Tomochichi Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse.  Once back in my Savannah office, I have a call with representatives from the Patients and Providers for Medical Nutrition Equity Coalition to discuss upcoming legislation before having a call with Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA) to discuss how we can work together on addressing the issue of vaccine hesitancy in minority communities.  

Friday, January 29, 2021:  After attending my Band of Brothers bible study this morning in Garden City, I head to Hinesville in Liberty County where local leaders are breaking ground on a small business incubator.

Weekly Update
January 31St 


As we begin the 117th Congress, Congressman Fulcher and I are ready to get to work for Idaho.  


￼



It's a privilege to continue to serve on the Appropriations Committee, both on the Interior Subcommittee and as Ranking Member of the Energy and Water Subcommittee. 



￼
 



￼


I joined 199 of my Republican colleagues urging Congressional leadership to protect the Hyde Amendment, which has saved the lives of over 2 million innocent babies by preventing the federal government from using taxpayer dollars to fund abortions.
 
 

￼



￼


Putting aside any political, historical or emotional arguments, the numbers speak for themselves on why a split of the Ninth Circuit is inevitable and why it is beyond time to authorize another judgeship for Idaho.

THE BLACKBURN REPORT  January 30, 2021 
SENATE INSIDER  
PROTECTING THE SANCTITY OF LIFE 
Protecting the right to live is paramount to my mission. In Washington D.C. and across the United States, members of the pro-life community gathered in-person and virtually for the March for Life to declare their support. In the Senate, I proposed legislation to prevent Title X taxpayer funds from going to abortion providers. 
￼ 
￼ 
SECURING OUR NATION 
Weak immigration policy turns every town into a border town and every state into a border state. That’s why this week I worked with my colleagues in the Senate to introduce two pieces of legislation to prioritize the safety of the American people. Holding sanctuary states accountable for disobeying federal immigration law and building barriers to birth tourism protect the American people and preserve the integrity of the border. 
  
SUPPORTING TENNESSEE BUSINESSES 
The Small Business Administration announced new low-interest disaster loans for Tennessee businesses and residents impacted by the Nashville explosion on December 25, 2020. These loans will help small businesses make an essential step toward economic recovery. To learn more and apply, visit the SBA website. 
  
STRENGTHENING LOCAL RESOURCES 
Eastman Chemical Co. announced plans to build a plastic-to-plastic recycling facility in northeastern Tennessee. In addition to supporting the local economy, this facility would help to recycle over 250 million pounds of plastic annually and strengthen local resources. 
  
Marsha’s Roundup 
This week on ‘Unmuted with Marsha,’ I spoke with Border Patrol Agent Art Del Cueto who shared his unique perspective on border security and how efforts to police our southern border have been impacted under the Biden administration. 
￼ 
￼ 
I took to the Senate floor to advocate for immigration policies that protect the American people.  
￼ 
￼ 
I joined Fox News’ Jon Scott to discuss the importance of promoting policies that support the American worker. 
￼ 
￼ 
On Newsmax, I spoke with Chris Salcedo about the risks of weak immigration policy.

CONGRESS MUST APPROVE MORE COVID RELIEF QUICKLY
Dear friend, 
The ongoing COVID-19 crisis has left too many Americans struggling to make ends meet. More than 23 million are finding it difficult to put food on the table, and we have still lost nearly 10 million jobs. New economic data this week showed that 2020 was the worst year for economic growth since World War II. Congress must act quickly to provide more relief to families, workers, small businesses, and our frontline workers combatting the virus. 
I am committed to working with the Biden administration and leaders in Congress to provide the tools necessary to finally end this pandemic. As the Chair of the New Democrat Coalition, I outlined a list of priorities to be included in the next COVID-19 relief bill. I also spoke with senior White House officials and House leadership this week about these priorities and how to get legislation approved quickly before any benefits lapse. Last year, Senate Majority Leader McConnell’s obstructionism and a lack of leadership from President Trump forced enhanced unemployment benefits, the national eviction moratorium, and other relief programs to expire leaving Americans with significant hardship and uncertainty around when more help would be available. We cannot let this happen again. 
Congress must act quickly because the cost of delay or inaction is too great. 
As always, I am here to help you. If you need assistance at this difficult time, please do not hesitate to contact my Kirkland office at (425) 485-0085. For more updates on what I’m doing for WA-01, you can follow me on social media at the links above.
Stay safe and stay healthy,
Suzan

Dear Friend,

This week marks the 48th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s devastating decision on Roe v. Wade, which legalized abortion throughout our country. In the years following the court’s misguided ruling, more than 60 million innocent lives have been lost - more than the entire population of the State of California. While this issue is deeply personal, it also speaks to the character of our nation. America should be a nation that values all innocent life.

As a person of faith, protecting innocent life is something I will never stop defending. Pro-life Americans have lots to be grateful for over the last four years, from making it harder for Planned Parenthood to provide abortion services to ensuring strong protections against taxpayer funds being used to support abortions...KEEP READING HERE

WHAT'S GREAT IN THE 8TH 


￼

Falling Spring Mill on Highway 19 typically has only one waterfall, but nature photographer Bob Anderson of West Plains was able to catch it with two after heavy rainfall. Built in the 1920s, the spring-powered mill generated electricity, ground corn and sawed lumber. What a beautiful reminder of the rich history Southern Missouri is founded upon.

￼

Nate Pulliam has proved himself a star Rolla Bulldog both on and off the wrestling mat. With 134-1 career record and a near-perfect GPA, Nate is setting an example of success for high school athletes in Southern Missouri. He attributes his success in sports and academia to the discipline that the sport demands and aspires to one day apply that discipline to becoming a doctor. Keep up the great work Nate!

￼

Marie Nowell of Cape Girardeau donated a picture of a police car that she colored-in to the Cape Girardeau Police Department. Marie has been known for her coloring skills since she took up the hobby in 2015. She donated the picture to thank the men and women in blue who protect and serve our communities.

￼

Danny Ford was honored by the VFW Post in Kennett after raising money for organizations that honor our veterans through his business, Glen Sain Motors. Through contributions like Danny's, local veterans have the opportunity to educate our communities on what it means to sacrifice for one's country.




 IN CASE YOU MISSED IT

￼

Regardless of who is in the White House, I’m going to defend the rights of the unborn and ensure hardworking Missourians’ tax dollars aren’t used to take innocent life.

￼

I had the pleasure of joining The Washington Watch with Tony Perkins to discuss my No Abortion Bonds Act. This bill closes loopholes that have been exploited for decades and protects hardworking Missourians tax dollars from funding abortion procedures that violate our values. I’m proud to continue to use my position on the House Budget and Ways and Means Committees to protect the lives of our unborn children.

￼

This week, Biden signed an Executive Order allowing the U.S. to fund global abortions. Taxpayers should never be forced to fund abortions - period. It’s shameful that Joe Biden has chosen to violate the conscience of millions of hardworking Americans by reversing the Mexico City Policy.

Pushing To Improve NYS Vaccination Program
 
  Dear Neighbor,  This week, we have continued our push to improve New York’s convoluted, ineffective, and poorly designed COVID-19 vaccination program.
 
To do so, we have helped lead the call for the federalization of the distribution of the vaccine in New York State. We believe if the state cannot demonstrate what’s working, it is time to use every available federal resource, including FEMA and other emergency response programs, to better coordinate the distribution of the vaccine to get this done.
 
New Yorkers shouldn’t have to navigate malfunctioning websites, jammed call centers, and confusing edicts to understand how and when they will gain access to life-saving medical treatments. Folks are already losing faith they will ever have access to the vaccine in a coherent, timely manner.
 
We will continue to work to solve this problem to ensure the best possible vaccine distribution system is in place for our communities so we can defeat COVID-19. You can read more about our efforts HERE. Working together, we will get through this.  Until Next Time,  Tom

￼   
 

 
 
Dear Friend,   This week, I joined thousands participating in this year’s virtual March for Life by celebrating life and defending the unborn. You can find my video message and two pro-life bills I reintroduced in my latest update below.
Standing Up Against a Sham Impeachment    On Tuesday, I was proud to lead the charge against the politicized and unconstitutional sham of an “impeachment” trial. I forced a vote on whether the Senate can hold a trial of a private citizen.
I also made clear, in an op-ed for the Washington Examiner and my speech on the floor that day, this impeachment sham is nothing more than a partisan exercise designed to further divide the country. Democrats claim to want to unify us, but as I wrote in the Examiner, impeaching a former president, a private citizen, is the antithesis of unity.   In the op-ed, I went on to state that, “Hyperpartisan Democrats are about to drag our great country down into the gutter of rancor and vitriol, the likes of which have never been seen in our nation’s history. Instead of doing the nation’s work with their new control of the House, Senate, and executive branch, Democrats are wasting the people’s time on a partisan vendetta against a man no longer in office. 
Celebrating March for Life   As I mentioned above, I joined many nationwide celebrating life. Our nation cannot expect to fully protect and maintain our other rights if we do not respect the fundamental right to life even starting in the womb.   It is unconscionable that the government would facilitate the taking of innocent life. I have stated many times that I will always support legislation that would end abortion or lead us in the direction of ending abortion.   Moreover, I reintroduced two pro-life bills, the Defund Planned Parenthood Act and Life at Conception Act.   The Defund Planned Parenthood Act would ensure federal tax dollars aren’t going to organizations, like Planned Parenthood, to perform abortions.   The Life at Conception Act ensures the 14th Amendment protections on the right to life are truly guaranteed for all human beings, including the unborn in all stages of development.   You can learn more about my legislation HERE.  
￼
I also recorded a special message on the importance of protecting these innocent lives, which you can watch HERE.   Opposing Blinken Nomination for Secretary of State And Speaking Out Against Waging Forever War Around the Globe   I spoke on the floor of the Senate to oppose the confirmation of Secretary of State nominee Antony Blinken. I pressed Mr. Blinken last week concerning the failed policy of regime change. Mr. Blinken has been a full-throated advocate of military intervention in the Middle East.  
￼
You can find my full speech HERE.      Media Wrap-Up     This week, I appeared on Fox News’ Primetime, Fox News Business with Lou Dobbs, Fox News America’s Newsroom, One America News, Real America’s Voice and Newsmax and spoke about how the impeachment process Democrats want to do is nothing but a sham.
￼
 I also joined Glenn Beck, Charlie Kirk , Sean Hannity, Dinesh D’Souza, WLVK’s Larry Glover, and Jan Jeffcoat with Sinclair Broadcasting to discuss these topics and more.  My Office is Here to Help You   My staff has an incredible track record of helping Kentuckians cut through the federal bureaucracy clutter to address challenges and concerns they may have.  
We stand ready to assist in areas including: 
● Veterans’ benefits or medical services; ● Social Security and Medicare benefits; ● Federal tax matters and the Internal Revenue Service; ● Immigration matters; ● Passports; ● Federal worker injury compensation; ● Military academy nominations; ● Federal student loans; and ● Replacing lost or damaged documents such as VA records and military medals and records.
So if you are a Kentucky resident and need help with any of the above or with other issues regarding federal agencies or programs, or if you need help navigating the federal response and ongoing needs related to COVID-19, feel free to contact my Bowling Green office at (270) 782-8303.  (Kentucky has also set up a COVID-19 Hotline at 1-800-722-5725.)  
Please contact us without hesitation, as my staff is happy to help!

Vaccine Updates and More
 
January 30, 2021
  
Dear Neighbor,
 
I remain committed to doing all that I can to help our community get vaccinated. Unfortunately, there has been a troubling trend of racial inequity in the rollout of the vaccine. I am pushing for more doses and more testing sites in our communities, free and safe transportation to vaccine sites, and more capacity on the phone lines where people can schedule vaccine appointments. I have been communicating with federal, state and local agencies to push for more immediate action on these issues. 
 
Sigo comprometida a hacer todo lo posible para ayudar a nuestra comunidad a vacunarse. Desafortunadamente, ha habido una tendencia preocupante de injusticia racial con la distribución de la vacuna. Estoy insistiendo para más dosis y más sitios de pruebas en nuestra área, transporte seguro y gratuito y a los sitios de vacunas, y más capacidad en las líneas telefónicas donde la gente harán sus citas de vacunas. 
 
In this newsletter you will find COVID vaccine information, resources in our community and updates from DC including environmental Policy Updates.
If you no longer live in the district, or want to unsubscribe from this newsletter,   please click here. 
  
 
COVID-19 Vaccine Updates and Information  
 
  
The vaccine supply is extremely limited in L.A. County. While we wait for more doses of the existing vaccines to be made available and a potential single shot option in the months ahead, we must continue to take all precautions. I encourage you and your family to get the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available and you are eligible. Los Angeles County’s Vaccine Distribution page describes the phases and tiers of vaccination, with more information about how these phases will roll out.    
  
As a reminder, L.A. County residents 65 and older are now eligible to receive the vaccine. Healthcare Workers, Staff & Residents at Skilled Nursing Facilities, and Staff and Residents at long-term care facilities are also eligible to receive the vaccine. People who work for in home health services (IHHS) that care for patients are also eligible to get the vaccine. If you work for IHHS, go online for an appointment and choose the option to book an appointment for a healthcare worker, make your appointment and show up with a paystub from IHHS or other proof of IHHS employment and a photo ID. 
 
You can find out when it is your turn to receive a vaccine by signing up on the statewide ‘My Turn’ website.   
￼
  
As the vaccine is still a limited resource, appointments at each vaccination site are limited. To make an appointment for yourself or a loved one, visit www.Vaccinatelacounty.com. If you aren’t able to make an appointment online, call 1(833) 540-0473. You should also check with your local clinic or healthcare provider and ask if they will have access to the vaccine.
 
Again, vaccines are still very limited and in high demand. Expect delays on phone lines and high traffic on websites. Please try the sites at different times of the day, since appointments are being added on a rolling basis. I recommend checking the website every morning because new appointments are being added every day. Know that officials are aware of the technical difficulties and are working to fix them. 
 
¿Se pregunta cuándo será elegible para recibir la vacuna COVID-19? 
  
Es importante que todos reciban la vacuna COVID-19 cuando sean elegibles. 
 
La página de Distribución de Vacunas del condado de Los Angeles describe la fases y niveles de vacunación, y con más  informació sobre cómo se implementarán  estas fases.
   
Debido al impacto severo que la pandemia continúa teniendo en nuestros vecinos y familiaress mayores de 65 años, el condado de Los Angeles ha priorizado el grupo de edad, haciéndolos elegibles para recibir la vacuna. Las personas que trabajan para el Programa de Servicios de Asistencia en el Hogar (IHSS) que atienden a pacientes también son elegibles para recibir la vacuna. Haga una cita como trabajador de la salud con anticipación y someta la documentación necesaria, como prueba de empleo de IHHS y una forma de identificación.
 
Como la vacuna sigue siendo un recurso limitado, las citas en cada centro de vacunación son limitadas. Para hacer una cita para usted o un ser querido, visite www.Vaccinatelacounty.com. Si no puede hacer una cita en línea, intente llamar al 1-833-540-0473. También debe consultar con su clínica o proveedor de atención médica y preguntar si tendrá acceso a la vacuna.
  
￼
  
Visite VaccinateLACounty.com para obtener información actualizada sobre las vacunas COVID-19 y para averiguar cuando será elegible para recibir una. 
 
Puede averiguar cuando es su turno de recibir una vacuna registrándose en el sitio web estatal ‘My Turn’.
 
Espere retrasos en las líneas telefónicas y mucho tráfico en los sitios web. Recomiendo consultar el sitio web todas las mañanas porque cada día se agregan nuevas citas. Pruebe los sitios en diferentes horarios del día, ya que las citas se agregan de forma continua y sepa que los trabajadores oficiales están al tanto de las dificultades técnicas y están trabajando para solucionarlas.  
  
Vaccine Scams
 
Be aware of vaccine scams, here are the facts about the vaccine in L.A. County. 
 
Estafas de Vacunas
 
Tenga en cuenta las estafas de vacunas, aquí está información correcta sobre la vacuna en el condado de Los Angeles.

COVID Vaccine Telephone Town Hall Report Back
 
On Tuesday, we held a Vaccine Telephone Town Hall with Supervisor Janice Hahn and L.A. County Public Health’s Dr. Seira Kurian. If you missed the event, you can listen here. Supervisor Hahn answered many of the FAQs on her Twitter account the following day.

El martes, tuvimos una reunión telefónica sobre la vacuna contra el COVID con La Supervisora Janice Hahn y la Dra. Seira Kurian de Salud Pública del Condado de Los Angeles. Si se perdió el evento, puede escucharlo aquí. 
 
Transportation and the Vaccine
 
Lack of transportation should not be a barrier to getting your vaccine. All of the pharmacy and clinic locations are walk-up, and drive-thru sites, like the big County-run sites, will accommodate walk-ups.
	•	Several ride sharing apps are also offering free or discounted rides to vaccination sites. Check your apps for more information. 
	•	Fiesta Taxi is offering South Gate seniors free transportation to the Downey Vaccination site. 
  
￼
  
Transporte y la Vacuna contra el COVID  
 
El transporte no debe ser un obstáculo para recibir su vacuna. Hay varios lugares donde no necesita un automóvil para vacunarse. 
	•	Varias aplicaciones para viajar en auto también están ofreciendo viajes gratuitos o con descuento a los sitios de vacunación. Revise sus aplicaciones para obtener más información. 
	•	Fiesta Taxi ofrece transporte gratuito a las personas mayores de edad de South Gate al sitio de vacunación en Downey.
Affordable Rideshares
 
Last December, Metro Micro launched a ride share program allowing passengers to travel anywhere within a specific service zone for only $1 per ride. The first service zones were designated for the LAX area and the communities of Watts and Willowbrook. This week, Metro Micro expanded to three new service zones, including one which will cover Compton and California State University, Dominguez Hills. More information here. 
 
En diciembre del año pasada, Metro Micro lanzó un programa de viajes en auto que permite a los pasajeros viajar a cualquier lugar dentro de una zona de servicio específica por solo $ 1 por viaje. Esta semana, Metro Micro expandió. Ahora servirá en las comunidades de Watts, Willowbrook, Compton y la Universidad de California, Dominguez Hills. Más información aquí.
  
 
COVID-19 & Resources in Our Community
 
Stay at Home Order Lifted
 
Governor Newsom has lifted the stay-at-home order and announced that all counties in California will be moving back to a system of colored tiers.
 
L.A. County will be in the highest-risk tier, purple. This means that, although outdoor dining is now open, the risk of spread is still very high and restrictions are still in place.  
 
Orden de Estadía en Casa
 El gobernador Newsom ha levantado el orden de estadía en casa. Aunque los restaurantes de comer al aire libre están abiertos, el riesgo de infección es todavía muy alto y las restricciones todavía están en su lugar. 
 
Types of Masks 
 
Please keep wearing your masks!
 
Experts always recommend the N95 mask if you have access to one. If you don’t, it’s always best to double-mask, or use a mask with three or more layers. If you’re using cloth masks, remember to wash your masks frequently and cycle between different ones. 
 
Los Tipos Recomendados de Mascarillas     Expertos siempre recomiendan la mascarilla N95 si tiene acceso a una. Si no, siempre es mejor usar doble mascarilla o usar una mascarilla con tres o más capas. Si usas mascarillas de tela, recuerde lavarla con frecuencia y alternar. 
 
Outbreak at our Ports 
 
I’ve been very concerned about the recent outbreak of COVID-19 at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. This outbreak impacts my constituents and their family members who work there, the surrounding communities, and could have catastrophic consequences on the local and national economy that depend on the ports.
  
Congressman Alan Lowenthal and I joined together in writing a letter to the State and County to highlight the importance of prioritizing port workers in vaccine distribution. It’s critical that we protect the essential workers who keep our port infrastructure operating and our goods flowing.
￼
  
Brote en nuestros puertos
  Me ha preocupado mucho el reciente brote de COVID-19 en los puertos de Los Angeles y Long Beach. El congresista Alan Lowenthal y yo escribimos una carta al estado y al condado para insistir la importancia de dar prioridad a los trabajadores del puerto en la distribución de vacunas.

CA Eviction Moratorium Bill Extended through June 30th, 2021
 
California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law on Friday that extends eviction protections through the end of June. Tenants who qualify for the protections will still owe their rent, they just can’t be evicted for not paying all of it. The law would use federal stimulus dollars to pay off 80% of some tenants’ unpaid rent, but only if landlords agree to forgive the remaining 20%. If landlords refuse the deal, the law would pay off 25% of tenants’ unpaid rent to make sure they qualify for eviction protections.
 
People who earn more than 80% of the area median income are not eligible for the money.

The Federal Response to COVID-19
 
President Biden has announced a comprehensive COVID-19 plan, which includes buying millions of new doses of the vaccine that will hopefully be available in the summertime. Negotiations over the next coronavirus relief plan continue. I will continue to push for regular, direct payments, expanded unemployment benefits, small business support, and rent/utility relief. 
 
El Gobierno Federal en respuesta a COVID-19 
  
El presidente Biden ha anunciado un plan extenso de COVID-19, que incluye la compra de millones de nuevas dosis de vacunas, que se espera que sean disponibles este verano. Las negociaciones sobre el próximo plan de alivio de coronavirus continua. Yo sigo insistiendo por pagos regulares, directos, beneficios de desempleo expandidos, ayuda para negocios pequeños y alivio de alquiler. 
 
Environmental Policy Updates 
 
This week was a busy one for environmental justice and climate action. President Biden announced several Executive Orders on climate and environmental justice, which I am proud to see and happy to support.
  
￼
I reintroduced the Energy Resilient Communities Act with Rep. Yvette Clarke. The bill invests in 100% clean energy microgrids to help communities fight climate change and keep the lights on after extreme weather events such as wildfires and hurricanes. 
 
I reintroduced the Climate Smart Ports Act to invest in pollution reduction at ports across the country, including the Port of Los Angeles.
  
I also led a letter with 26 of my colleagues asking President Biden to reverse a last minute decision by the Trump Administration to eliminate funding for urban parks in underserved communities. 
 
Actualizaciones de Política Ambiental    Esta semana, el Presidente Biden anunció varias órdenes ejecutivas sobre el clima y la justicia ambiental, que estoy orgullosa y contenta de apoyar.
 
Reintroduje la Ley de Comunidades Resistentes a la Energía para luchar contra la crisis climática con la Congresista Yvette Clarke.   También reintroduje la Ley de Puertos Climáticamente Inteligentes para invertir en la reducción de la contaminación en puertos de todo el país, incluido el Puerto de los Angeles.    Finalmente, dirigí una carta pidiéndole al presidente Biden que cambiara la decisión de la Administración Trump que hizo a última hora de eliminar fondos para los parques urbanos en comunidades de pocos recursos.

1/30/21 12:07,Rep. Grothman Newsletter- I Am Pro-Life,"￼

 
I Am Pro-Life
 
I am committed to protecting life from conception to natural death. We have a moral and civic duty to protect those who are voiceless and defenseless, including unborn children. During my service in the Wisconsin Legislature I was a proud two-time recipient of Pro-Life Wisconsin’s Legislator of the Year Award and was a consistent supporter of pro-life legislation. I have continued to support legislation that protects the sanctity of all life as I represent you in Congress.
 
That is why I was shocked by two stories out of the Biden White House this week.
 
The first was President Biden's plan to encourage Congress to undo the Hyde amendment. This amendment prevents your tax dollars from being used to pay for abortions. Regardless of what side of the aisle you are on, it is unacceptable for the government to take tax dollars away from citizens to pay for a practice that goes against their deeply-held moral and religious beliefs. I joined nearly 200 of my colleagues to unite in opposition to any budget bill that removes Hyde amendment protections because all humans deserve a chance at life.
 
The second story was President Biden's decision to end the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance (PLGHA) policy instituted by President Trump. This is a policy that 3/4 of Americans agree with. The policy states that no foreign aid money shall go to overseas organizations that provide abortions unless they end this practice. In response to this, 136 of my colleagues and I sent this letter to the President to voice the concerns of the millions of Americans who take issue with their money being sent overseas to abortion providers.
 
I will always fight for the issues that matter to you, including protecting life. Joe Biden preached ""unity"" at his inaugural address. Then in his first ten days on the job, he issued more executive orders than any other President, which included pro-abortion measures that went against the will of tens of millions of Americans who have a moral and religious stance against killing a child before they are born.
 
So much for ""unity"".
  
￼
  
 
Halting the Wall
 
President Biden also issued an Executive Order to stop construction of the wall on the U.S.-Mexican border. The wall has been proven to be effective by both Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Homeland Security as a whole.
 
I have been to our Southern border many times. Whether it is in Texas, Arizona or California, every border patrol agent I speak with tells me that walls work and are essential in helping them stop drug, arms and human trafficking at the border. During my most recent trip to the border, I learned that every two miles without a wall takes four to six agents to cover, as opposed to one agent who can cover the same area with a wall.
 
Having a wall at our Southern border gives our severely understaffed and underpaid border patrol agents more time to react to the crises they handle daily. These brave men and women work every day to keep Americans safe. They also help protect prospective immigrants from the terrors of the drug cartels on the other side of the border by offering a clear, safe path to America. 
 
With his executive order to stop construction of the wall, President Biden is making the work of our border patrol agents harder and seems to be telling them that they are wrong to want something that helps them better do their job. He has also, with his actions, told the drug cartels that America is fine with porous borders and that we will not be using every tool we have to stop their illicit behavior from affecting Americans.
  
 
National Guard
 
Last week, I let you know about the letter I sent to House and Senate leadership urging them to allow members of the National Guard in Washington, DC to protect the Capitol the ability to tour the building. For many of them, this is the first time they have been in our nation's capital and for some it will be the only time. It is only fitting that after weeks of long days, these cold, tired and homesick service members be afforded the opportunity to tour the building they came here to protect.
 
I am pleased to report that my letter was well-received and this week, members of the National Guard were able to tour the Capitol in small, socially distanced groups with professional Capitol Visitors Center (CVC) tour guides.
 
Thanks again to these brave men and women for your service to our country. I know you have to put your lives on hold to serve, and your dedication has not gone unnoticed. Please do not hesitate to call on me if you ever need my assistance.
 
P.S. I cosponsored a bipartisan bill introduced by Congressmen Steve Womack (R-AR) and Seth Moulton (D-MA) to honor members of the National Guard serving in Washington, DC to protect the Capitol. You can read more by clicking here.
  
 
My Committee Assignments for th 117th Congress
 
I am pleased to announce that I will be serving on three committees this Congress:
	•	House Committee on Oversight and Reform
	•	House Committee on Education and Labor
	•	House Committee on the Budget
I have served on all of these committees in the past and look forward to continuing to work for you.
  
 
Weekly Roundup
 
I successfully fought for more funding toward researching Neurofibromatosis, which affects roughly 1 in 3000 Americans. Thanks to the Littlest Tumor Foundation for speaking with me this week, and for all your hard work and advocacy. We still have work to do!
  
￼
  
At the Waushara County Towns Association meeting, I gave an update on what to expect from Congress this year and how I am fighting for pro-worker, pro-business policies that will keep Wisconsin Working.
  
￼
  
On Wednesday, we recognized Holocaust Remembrance Day. We remember and honor all the men, women and children who suffered and died during the Holocaust and in the years after.
  
￼
  
￼
  
As we come together in celebration of National School Choice Week, we’re grateful for Wisconsin parents’ ability to choose the best K-12 education option for their children, including public schools, charter schools, private schools, online academies and homeschooling.

2020 was a year unlike any other, but my office never stopped working for you. Please don’t hesitate to contact my Fond du Lac or Washington, DC office if you need my assistance.

As your Congressman, I’m here to serve you. If you have any questions please don’t hesitate to reach out to my offices in Fond du Lac and Washington.

PRESIDENT BIDEN’S ATTACK ON AMERICAN ENERGY
It was no secret President Biden planned to destroy the oil and gas industry if elected president and in the first week of his administration, he’s taken actions to do just that. This week, he signed an executive order banning oil and gas drilling on federal lands for one year, which makes us more dependent on foreign oil and increases prices for American families, not to mention eliminates good-paying jobs in the middle of a pandemic.
 
On his first day in office, President Biden directly attacked the American energy industry and our energy independence by cancelling a key permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline. No president should have the authority to unilaterally cancel such a large project that brings good-paying jobs and economic development to our country. That’s why I introduced the Promoting Cross-Border Energy Infrastructure Act.
 
This legislation simplifies the construction and operation of energy facilities that cross international borders and replaces the Presidential Permit requirements before constructing an energy facility that crosses the U.S. border between Canada or Mexico. Energy production in the United States plays a vital role in our country’s job creation and economic growth and this bill will prevent further political decisions that destroy the industry.
 
#SAVEHYDE
￼
 
The Hyde Amendment ensures taxpayer dollars are never used to fund abortions. The radical Left is trying to eliminate this important protection and that’s why I joined 199 of my colleagues in demanding they save Hyde in any government funding bill. This is a fight worth fighting.  PPP 2.0  
￼
 
The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) 2.0 is up and running! This program is a lifeline for small businesses who have been impacted by the pandemic, including more than 66,000 Oklahoma small businesses. Last year, the original PPP saved more than 50 million jobs across the country.
 
Loans will be available until March 31, 2021 or until the money runs out, whichever is sooner. You can apply through any existing SBA 7(a) lender or through any federally insured depository institution, federally insured credit union, and Farm Credit System institution that is participating. Other regulated lenders will be available to make these loans once they are approved and enrolled in the program. You should consult with your local lender as to whether it is participating in the program.  
 
For more information about the PPP,  click here  to visit my website. 
 
LIFE IS ALWAYS WORTH FIGHTING FOR
￼
 Our founding fathers wrote in the Declaration of Independence all men are created equal and are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights: the Right to Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. Every person, born or unborn, is entitled to these God-given rights. From the moment of conception, each child is worthy of life and protection from harm.
 
In the 117th Congress with a Democratic majority and a Democratic president, long-standing pro-life protections are under attack. No matter what, I will continue to fight to safeguard the rights of the unborn.
 
WHERE ARE YOU IN DISTRICT 2?
￼
Communities all across the Second Congressional District of Oklahoma are full of things that make them unique and I want to highlight some of them. Every week on my Facebook page, I will post an up-close photo of a landmark somewhere in the district with a clue to where it is. I encourage everyone to put their best guess in the comments. The correct answer will be right here, in my weekly e-newsletter.
￼
This landmark honors Oklahoma musicians for their lifetime achievements in music. It’s the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame in Muskogee! Congratulations to Meagan McElhaney Caldwell who was the first correct guess.
 
Stay in touch by visiting my Facebook and Twitter pages and as always, don’t hesitate to contact me if I can help in any way.

WELCOME to UTAH CD-3, the District Newsletter of U.S. Congressman John Curtis. This is a place where we share activities of the Congressman and articles relevant to Utah’s 3rd district. Finally, we highlight the successes of you, the backbone of what makes Utah the best state in the country.

￼
￼

Americans want Congress to solve problems, not perpetuate the divisiveness that has become all too common in our political realm. Since coming to Washington DC, I have introduced multiple pieces of legislation signed into law—all of them with bipartisan support. I am proud to be joining the Problem Solvers Caucus to work towards pragmatic solutions to improve the lives of Utahns and Americans. Learn more about the Caucus and our priorities [HERE].
I am also looking forward to working on a new committee in the 177th Congress: the House Energy and Commerce Committee. No committee in Congress has more impact on Utah, including its oversight of all policy related to healthcare, technology, commerce, environment, energy, and much more. I look forward to representing Utah’s interest on the following subcommittees: Health, Communications & Technology, and Environment & Climate Change.

MORE TIER 3 FUEL
HollyFrontier became the latest refinery in Utah to produce Tier 3 gasoline, which in newer model cars reduces emissions by as much as 80% and in older vehicles by 12%.  The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the Clean Air Act, has said that the Wasatch Front is the place in the country that would benefit the most from using Tier 3 fuel in vehicles, which account for about 50% of emissions polluting the atmosphere.

MY OFFICE HAS SUCCESSFULLY HELPED MORE THAN 1,500 UTAHNS TO OVERCOME ISSUES WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.
This hands-on work is one of the favorite parts of this job. Far too often, paperwork errors become roadblocks for Utahns who are owed payment or need information for veterans, social security, or immigration. That’s where my staff and I can step in.
One recent example of where our office helped a family is told below, with their permission:
The Hoopes family had been trying to adopt two brothers from Tanzania, Africa, for five years.  They started the process in 2014/2015 when the boys were ages three and five. At every turn, they faced one trial or another. The father, Mark lived in Tanzania with the boys for three years during this time. Tonya, the mother, was flying back and forth between Utah and Tanzania, trying to keep their business in Utah afloat while also trying to see her family. She made a total of 16 trips back and forth in four years. The longest she was ever able to stay in Tanzania was 10 days. The Hoopes reached out to our office in 2016. With help from the Governor’s office, we finally were able to finalize immigration paperwork to get the boys to Utah. They landed here on May 15th, 2020 and the Hoopes are in the process of finalizing the adoption in the Utah courts and the boys’ citizenship certificates. They are so happy to be together in Utah as a family. 
If you or someone you know if having an issue with a federal agency, please contact my office!

BLUFF, UTAH

Nominated as one of Budget Travel Magazine’s coolest small towns, Bluff is nestled between dramatic sandstone bluffs and the San Juan River on the Trail of the Ancients Scenic Byway in southeastern Utah. Bluff is an artist’s community featuring quality lodging, shopping, and dining. The original 1880 Bluff City townsite, now the Bluff Historic District, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The population of Bluff is about 320 and was recently incorporated in 2018.
Ancestral Puebloans established the area’s first settlements around 650 A.D. Some of the Southwest’s most impressive prehistoric rock art and ruins lie in or near Bluff. Ancestral Puebloans may have been drawn here because of the river and twin formations, such as the Twin Rocks and the twin alcoves visible in the bluffs across the river. Twins have a prominent place in native legends.  In 1880, Bluff was settled by Mormon pioneers seeking to establish a mission in the Four Corners area. Seventy families spent six months traveling to Bluff over the arduous Hole in the Rock trail. Soon after their arrival, they built one-room cabins and established the Bluff Fort. In later, more prosperous years, the pioneers built fine Victorian homes, many of which have been carefully restored in the Bluff Historic District.
The culture and spirit of the Navajo people are woven throughout Bluff’s eclectic style of today. The Utah Navajo Fair and Rodeo is a fun weekend in September with a traditional pow wow and rodeo. Bluff’s trading posts showcase unique, museum-quality Native American art and can often provide you with information on the artist.

￼

BLUFF MAYOR ANN LEPPANEN 
Mayor Leppanen had been hiking and backpacking with her husband, Bill Crowder, in the Four Corners area for some years prior to them settling in to build a home in Bluff in 1998. For more than 30 years, she had been a resident of St. Paul, Minnesota but she has called Bluff “home” since her retirement from the Ramsey County, Minnesota bench in 2011. Prior to her appointment to the bench, Mayor Leppanen engaged in the practice of law, both managing her own law firm and working for Southern Minnesota Regional Legal Services.  Much of her legal work, both in practice and on the bench, focused on cases involving domestic violence.
Prior to 2018 Bluff was an unincorporated community. Following a lengthy process in which Ann Leppanen was heavily involved, the citizens gave an overwhelming “yes” vote to incorporate 37 square miles. The Bluff Town Council held its first council meeting on September 6, 2018 and since that time, Mayor Leppanen and the council have been diligently hard at work “building a town.” They recognize Bluff is a town that is a gateway community to the Bears Ears National Monument, a border town to the Navajo Nation, a town that has a large, diverse community, and is reliant on a tourist-focused economy.
On a personal note, Mayor Leppanen has two stepdaughters who have families that include three grandsons and a granddaughter. She was a founding member of the Bluff Animal Rescue Committee (BARC). And she currently now serves as a “helper” with the Bluff Food Pantry.

Keeping My Promises to You

Friends,
 
It's taken longer than any of us would've liked, but Congress has finally started getting down to the business of doing the job we were sent here to do. 
 
I made four very specific promises to you and the Lowcountry: 

	•	I promised to force Washington to rebuild America's crumbling infrastructure
	•	I promised to make our veterans a top priority for Congress, not an afterthought
	•	I promised to do all in my power to defend your liberties from a runaway federal government
	•	I promised to protect Parris Island for generations to come

This week, I moved closer to making good on all of these promises. I was selected to serve on three key House committees: Transportation & Infrastructure, House Veterans' Affairs, and Oversight & Reform. All three of these committees put me in the best position to support the Port of Charleston and our highways, advocate for our veterans to get the care they deserve, and block Washington from inserting itself into the Lowcountry way of life. This is an incredible opportunity, one that I intend to use to keep my promises to you. 
 
On Thursday, I introduced my very first bill aimed at protecting Parris Island. I promised you all my very first act as congresswoman would be to defend Parris Island. Parris Island is not only fundamental to our national defense, but also supports 6,000 jobs and $800 million in economic activity. Parris Island is an integral part of our Beaufort community and the Palmetto State. My bill will ensure it remains open to train marines for generations to come.
 
The highlight of my week was the opportunity to meet with so many amazing constituents like you. I toured Parris Island, visited Palmetto State Armory, and learned from local business leaders. I ran to put the Lowcountry first, and I am fully committed to doing just that. 
 
With our recent committee assignments, our team is in a great position to ensure YOUR priorities are put front and center before Congress, and that I have every tool available to put the #LowcountryFirst.
 
So, it's time to roll up our sleeves and get to work! 
 
Sincerely, 
￼

Mace and Colleagues Introduce Bill Protecting Parris Island

Six S.C. Republicans co-sponsored a new version of the “Parris Island Protection Act” introduced in Congress on Thursday, months after the Beaufort and Port Royal communities were startled by the news that the U.S. Marine Corps may close the boot camp. The bill would prohibit the use of federal funds to close or plan the closure of the U.S. Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island, which is one of two Marine training depots in the country.

1/30/21 10:03,Weekly Update: Investing in America's Infrastructure,"

Weekly Update | January 30, 2021
 

Investing in America's Infrastructure

America’s roads, bridges, tunnels, and transit face a funding gap of more than $1.1 trillion by 2025. One in five miles of highway pavement is in poor condition and congestion costs the U.S. economy nearly $305 billion annually. Continued underinvestment will lead to longer trips to work or school, more costly maintenance expenses, and unsafe road conditions.
 
One way to improve our nation’s infrastructure is by turning to private sector financing. Private Activity Bonds allow state or local governments to issue tax-exempt debt, with approval from the U.S. Department of Transportation, for qualified highway or surface freight transfer facilities. As of December 1, 2020, no surface transportation Private Activity Bonds remain available as the entire $15 billion statutory cap has been issued or allocated by the Department of Transportation. The BUILD Act, which I co-sponsor, would double the statutory cap to $30 billion, allowing state and local governments to enter into public-private partnerships and improve their ability to finance additional surface transportation projects.
 
Investing in our nation’s infrastructure is one of my top priorities in Congress. Our bipartisan legislation expands the use of an innovative public-private partnership to encourage new investments in road, bridge, rail, and freight projects. It’s no secret that our infrastructure is in desperate need of additional investment. I look forward to working with lawmakers in Congress to pass the BUILD Act and other critical infrastructure legislation.

Learn more about the BUILD Act here.

Supporting Local Fire Departments
 

Pictured above: Bunker Hill Fire Department

This month, our office announced several grants that were awarded to local fire departments to purchase new vehicles and equipment, including safety equipment to protect firefighters from COVID-19. The districts and departments who have received the grants are:

Bunker Hill Fire Protection District: $27,826.67
Village of Taylor Springs Fire Department: $2,786.90
Roodhouse Fire Protection District: $40,500.00

I’m a proud supporter of these firefighter grants in Congress because they are critical to helping our fire departments protect themselves and the communities they serve. This is particularly true as we combat the Coronavirus pandemic. Taxpayers in these communities pay into the system and it’s important they see the benefits.

You can learn more about these grants here and here. 
 


Protecting the Hyde Amendment

The Hyde Amendment, first enacted in 1976 and named after former Republican Congressman Henry Hyde of Illinois, barred the use of federal taxpayer dollars funding abortions, except in cases of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. The Hyde Amendment has received bipartisan support since its inception.

This week, nearly 200 House Republican colleagues and I sent a letter to Congressional leaders urging them to protect the Hyde Amendment and maintain its inclusion in government funding legislation. The letter states in part:
 
""We write to express our unified opposition to Congressional Democrats’ efforts to repeal the Hyde Amendment and other current-law, pro-life appropriations provisions. As part of their pro-abortion crusade, Democrats have taken direct aim at these long-standing, bipartisan protections that generally prevent the federal government from using taxpayer dollars to support abortion procedures.
 
""Repealing these pro-life provisions would destroy nearly half a century of bipartisan consensus. Each year since 1976, Congress has included Hyde protections in annually enacted appropriations. No president in American history has ever vetoed an appropriations bill due to its inclusion of the Hyde Amendment. Moreover, President Obama maintained the Hyde Amendment in each of his budget proposals. As recent as June 2019, former Vice President Joe Biden supported the Hyde Amendment and acknowledged that it works harmoniously with federal funding for women’s healthcare...""

Inviting President Biden and Interior Secretary-Designate Haaland to Visit the 1908 Race Riot Site
 

Pictured above: Part of the Race Riot Site in Springfield, Illinois in 1908

Earlier this month, I invited President Joe Biden and Interior Secretary-Designate and Rep. Deb Haaland (D-N.M.) to visit the 1908 Springfield Race Riot Site, which sits in Illinois’ 13th Congressional District. 
 
Here's a portion of my letter to President Biden:
 
""I write to invite you to visit the site of the 1908 Springfield Race Riot in Illinois. Located in my congressional district, the site and its artifacts were unearthed during construction of the Carpenter Street segment of the Springfield Rail Improvements Project and consists of the remains of five homes that were burned during the 1908 Springfield Race Riot, one of the worst race riots in our nation’s history.
  
""...The Race Riot in Springfield demonstrated that racial injustice was not an isolated issue only in the South, but one to be addressed across the nation. In February 1909, and in response to the riots, civil rights leaders formed the National Negro Committee in New York City, New York, which would later become the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the oldest civil rights organization in the world.
 
""I have worked tirelessly with the previous administration, as well as with my colleagues in the House and Senate to designate this site as a national monument in recognition of its significance as a major event in the African American Civil Rights struggle.

""...As our nation continues to experience deep racial tension, now more than ever, this site tells an important story that we must not forget. I look forward to working with you and your Administration and would be proud to welcome you to visit the 13th Congressional District. Thank you for your consideration of this invitation and support of the Site’s inclusion in the National Park System.""

DIGNITY & RESPECT FOR UNBORN CHILDREN
￼
Every human life is a gift from God, and every person deserves dignity and respect.
This week as Americans from every corner of the nation celebrate life, House Republicans are renewing our commitment to defending the unborn and taking action to protect the inherent dignity of abortion victims.
That’s why I just reintroduced the Dignity for Aborted Children Act to require dignified disposition of aborted fetal remains.
The sickening discovery in 2019 of thousands of human fetal remains on the property of Ulrich Klopfer, Indiana’s most prolific abortionist, was a tragic reminder of the terrible cost of abortion.
Such callous disregard for the sanctity of life should have no place in our society.
I’m honored to work alongside my Hoosier colleagues, including Congressman Jim Banks, on this important pro-life bill, which includes strong reporting requirements to hold abortion providers accountable.
Building on the Indiana law enacted in 2016 and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, our bill would: 
	•	Require abortion providers to dispose of aborted fetal remains just as they would any other human remains. Failure to do so would be punishable by a fine and up to five years in prison.
	•	Require a consent form so the mother can choose between retaining possession of her unborn child or allowing the provider to cremate or inter the remains. Failure of the provider to execute these forms would be punishable by a civil penalty.
	•	Require abortion providers to report to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) the transfer of remains for cremation or interment. Contractors providing these services would be required to report how they provided for proper disposition.
	•	Direct HHS to annually review these reports to verify all abortion providers are ensuring the dignified disposition of aborted children.
STANDING FOR LIFE
￼
I stand with all pro-life Americans in defending the sanctity of life and fighting for the most vulnerable among us.
Sadly, the new administration and the leadership in Congress are committed to a radical agenda that devalues life and denies the humanity of precious unborn babies. But I’m as dedicated as ever to the fight for life.
This week I signed a letter with 199 of my House Republican colleagues pledging to vote against any government funding bill that eliminates or weakens prohibitions on taxpayer-funded abortion. You can read our letter here.
The Hyde Amendment has existed for more than forty years and prevents the federal government from funding abortion. Repealing this or other pro-life provisions would destroy nearly a half century of bipartisan consensus. 
I also helped reintroduce the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which ensures infants born alive after a failed abortion attempt receive the same protection of law and degree of care as any newborn.
It is not only common sense that medical providers should provide the same level of care to any baby no matter how they’re born – it’s simply what is right. 
The bill passed the House in 2018, but was not taken up in the Senate. In the last Congress, Speaker Pelosi refused to allow an up or down vote, ignoring repeated calls from my Republican colleagues and I that the bill be taken to the floor.
We must stand together against this radical and inhumane agenda, and we must act to protect the rights of all infants.
I pray that through compassion and service to others, we can foster a culture of life.
And I remain committed to protecting the sanctity of life, preventing the use of taxpayer dollars to fund abortions, and defending the inherent dignity of every person, born or unborn.
As always, it is a privilege to represent 2nd District Hoosiers in Congress.

￼
This week, Senator Rick Scott outlined a number of his priorities for the 117th Congress, which include re-filing several of his bills to reform Washington, protect Floridians and their businesses against the threat of Communist China, and hold dangerous dictators in Latin America who threaten the security of Florida and the United States accountable.
Senator Rick Scott said, “Two years ago, I began my service in the U.S. Senate determined to make Washington work better for Florida families. We’ve made some great progress, but as we all look forward to the 117th Congress, I want to make one thing very clear – I am absolutely focused on fighting for Florida and getting things done that actually help families and businesses succeed and live their dreams in our great nation. Surely, this won’t be easy. In the short time that I’ve served so far in the U.S. Senate I’ve learned that too much of the focus in Washington is on politics, not people. It’s time for that to change.   ""I’m starting the 117th Congress strong by proposing real solutions to reform Washington, protect our environment and national security, and hold dictators in Communist China, Venezuela and around the globe accountable. I truly hope that the Biden Administration and my Democratic colleagues will join me in these efforts. I look forward to continuing my work on behalf of all Floridians and getting real results that make our state and nation stronger, more successful, and more accountable to the people.""

Sen. Rick Scott: We Must Enhance Border Security and Provide Permanent DACA Protection 
Senator Rick Scott announced his intent to file a bill to provide funding and resources needed to secure America’s Southern border, and offer a permanent solution for individuals registered in and eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. Senator Scott’s action follows repeated announcements and actions by the Biden Administration to advance radical immigration policy rooted in open borders and amnesty, pause deportations of illegal immigrants, and completely ignore border security.  Senator Rick Scott said, “One of the most moving experiences of my life has been watching new American citizens say the pledge of allegiance at their nationalization ceremony. I’ve always said that getting immigration reform done becomes a lot easier once our border is secure and we have a permanent solution for DACA. Today, I am proud to announce that I am filing a bill that provides a permanent solution to the many people in the DACA program and provides tens of billions of dollars in long-term funding for our Southern border wall and border security personnel. My proposal will give our law enforcement and border patrol the resources they need to do their job, protect American families and stem the tide of the rampant and unyielding illegal immigration we’ve seen for decades at the Southern border. President Biden’s plan of open borders and amnesty isn’t about practical reforms – it’s a radical and dangerous subversion of law and order. We can and must do better.   “American innovation and our unique culture has been built on legal immigration. But, for too long, politicians in Washington have refused to address the issue of illegal immigration head-on, and we can’t ignore it anymore. Doing so is reckless and unfair to the American people, kills American jobs, and prevents countless families from pursuing the opportunity to chase their American Dream. It’s time to come together and finally bring a sensible solution forward."" Read more HERE.

Senador Rick Scott: Debemos mejorar la seguridad en nuestra frontera y brindar protección permanente para DACA 
El Senador Rick Scott anunció su intención de presentar un proyecto de ley que proporcionaría fondos y recursos necesarios para asegurar la frontera sur de los Estados Unidos y ofrecer una solución permanente para las personas registradas y elegibles para el programa de Acción Diferida para los Llegados en la Infancia (DACA). La acción del Senador Scott se da luego de varios anuncios y acciones de la Administración Biden para promover una política migratoria radical basada en fronteras abiertas y amnistía, detener las deportaciones de inmigrantes ilegales e ignorar por completo la seguridad en la frontera.  El Senador Rick Scott dijo: “Una de las experiencias más conmovedoras de mi vida ha sido ver a nuevos ciudadanos americanos decir el juramento en su ceremonia de nacionalización. Siempre he dicho que lograr una reforma migratoria es más fácil una vez que nuestra frontera esté segura y tengamos una solución permanente para DACA. Me enorgullece anunciar hoy que estoy presentando un proyecto de ley que brindará una solución permanente a las personas en el programa DACA y proporcionará decenas de miles de millones de dólares en fondos a largo plazo para un muro en la frontera sur y oficiales de seguridad fronteriza. Mi propuesta le dará a nuestra policía y patrulla fronteriza los recursos que necesitan para hacer su trabajo, proteger a las familias estadounidenses y detener la marea de inmigración ilegal desenfrenada que hemos visto durante décadas en la frontera sur. El plan del Presidente Biden de fronteras abiertas y amnistía no se trata de reformas prácticas, es una propuesta radical y peligrosa para la ley y el orden. Podemos y debemos hacer algo mejor.   ""La innovación americana y nuestra cultura única se han construido sobre la inmigración legal. Pero por mucho tiempo, los políticos en Washington se han negado a abordar el tema de la inmigración ilegal de frente, y no podemos ignorarlo más. Hacerlo sería imprudente e injusto para el pueblo americano, eliminaría trabajos e impediría que innumerables familias tengan la oportunidad de perseguir su Sueño Americano. Es hora de unirnos y finalmente presentar una solución sensata”. Lea más AQUÍ.

Sen. Rick Scott: “Buy American” Puts American Interests First 
In 2020, the U.S. Senate passed Senator Rick Scott’s bipartisan “Buy American” resolution calling on all Americans to support American jobs and manufacturing and build our supply chain by purchasing American-made products, from any American manufacturer. This week, Senator Rick Scott offered his support of President Joe Biden’s “Buy American” executive order, which directs agencies to strengthen requirements for procuring goods and services from sources that will support U.S. businesses and workers.
Senator Rick Scott said, “Last year, the Senate passed my bipartisan resolution calling on families to buy American-made products whenever possible to help support American jobs and manufacturing, and build our supply chain. Now more than ever, Americans must remember that every time we buy a product ‘Made in China,’ we are putting another dollar into the pockets of Communist Chinese government leaders and their cronies who steal our jobs and our technology. It’s not always easy to buy American, but it’s an important step we can all take at home to ensure America remains a leader in the global economy and is self-reliant in our supply chain. Buying American is not partisan, and I’m glad to see President Biden join me in acting to put American interests first. I hope the Biden Administration’s foreign policy nominees will share this commitment to holding Communist China accountable and take aggressive action to confront the threat it poses to international security and American interests."" Read more HERE.

Senator Rick Scott joined Senator Ted Cruz and colleagues to reintroduce an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would impose term limits on Members of Congress. U.S. Senators would be limited to two six-year terms and members of the House of Representatives to three two year terms.  Senator Rick Scott said, “Washington is more dysfunctional than ever, and I’m fighting every day to make reforms in the best interest of American families. Career politicians are never going to make the tough choices needed to get our nation on a successful path. They care more about politics and their next election than the future of this country.

I’m proud to join Senators Rubio, Hirono and Schatz to reintroduce the Restoring Resilient Reefs Act, which will build on our efforts and help restore and protect our coral reef ecosystems.

Senator Scott has long called for reforms to fix the broken immigration system and believes we must take swift action to address this critical issue, including providing real, long-term solutions for TPS and DACA, but that must start with securing the border. Read more, including the full letter, HERE.

Today, I’m proud to join Senator Rubio to build on these efforts by reintroducing the South Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act to expand research and our understanding of blue-green algae and red tide.

Sen. Rick Scott: Biden Needs to End Democrat Hostility Toward Israel and Stand up for our Great Ally 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following the announcement that the Biden Administration will restore diplomatic relations with the Palestinian Authority, including a resumption of American aid to the Palestinians.   Senator Rick Scott said, “The Trump Administration made tremendous efforts to facilitate peace and prosperity between our great ally Israel and Arab nations. Two weeks in, and the Biden Administration wants to undo this progress and appease illegitimate Palestinian leaders – demonstrating once again the Democrats’ reckless disregard for the security and prosperity of Israel. The Palestinian leadership, which has been operating as a dictatorship for 15 years, had their last election for president in 2005. They still do not accept Israel’s existence and support terrorism. Israel is a vibrant democracy that supports capitalism, champions human rights and holds free and open elections. The Biden Administration can’t go down this path. The United States must always align with those fighting for freedom and democracy, and stand up against those that do not respect human rights."" Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott Reintroduces American Security Drone Act 
Senator Rick Scott reintroduced the bipartisan American Security Drone Act for the 117th Congress. Senator Scott’s American Security Drone Act works to prohibit the U.S. Government from purchasing drones manufactured in countries identified as national security threats, like Iran and Communist China. The American Security Drone Act, which was passed out of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee last Congress, is cosponsored by Senators Chris Murphy, Marco Rubio, Richard Blumenthal, Marsha Blackburn, Tom Cotton and Josh Hawley.  
Senator Rick Scott said, “I’m proud to join my colleagues to reintroduce my American Security Drone Act, which will help protect our national security and the privacy of American citizens by prohibiting the federal government from buying drones manufactured by our adversaries. I’ve been very clear about the threat we face from technology companies controlled by Communist China, which is known for espionage and theft of technology. For too long, the United States has used taxpayer dollars to buy drones from companies backed by the Communist Chinese Government, allowing one of the United States’ biggest adversaries into the most sensitive areas of our government and putting our national security at risk. There’s absolutely no reason we should allow this to continue. We must pass the American Security Drone Act immediately.” Read more HERE

Senators Rick Scott, Ron Johnson and Marco Rubio Introduce the Luke and Alex School Safety Act 
Senator Rick Scott joined Senators Ron Johnson and Marco Rubio to reintroduce the Luke and Alex School Safety Act.

The clearinghouse also provides information on available federal resources and grant programs that can be used toward these safety measures.
Senator Rick Scott said, “Nearly three year ago, we lost 17 innocent lives in the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. I think about those lives lost, and the families impacted, every day. Since that horrible day, I’ve worked closely with many of the victims’ family members as Governor and now as Senator to ensure no child, educator, or family has to experience that again. This legislation, the Luke and Alex School Safety Act, honors two of the victims, Luke Hoyer and Alex Schachter, and builds on our work to keep schools safe and prevent another tragedy. I will never stop working to protect our students and educators, and ensure they have a safe environment to learn and succeed."" Read more from Senator Johnson’s office HERE.

His plan is filled with progressive pipe dreams and wasteful spending. We ought to be working on solutions that provide targeted relief and deal directly with the horrific economic and health impact of Covid-19. Unfortunately, his plan is more focused on using the pandemic to push harmful liberal priorities.…""   Read the full letter to the editor in the Wall Street Journal HERE.

Congressman Smith's E-news: January 30, 2021  
￼

This week I met with the leadership of local health departments to discuss public health readiness and COVID response. 

Defending Life

Every year, the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision inspires countless Americans to gather in spirit to exercise their First Amendment rights and peacefully protest on behalf of the unborn. This annual spotlight on the pro-life movement is a reminder of the ever growing and inspiring movement, both across the country and here in our nation’s capital. Defending life in its earliest form is critical to the humanity of our society. 

Over the past four years, President Trump continuously worked to protect human life by implementing pro-life policies like Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance (PLGHA) policy and appointing pro-life judges. With the Biden Administration and Democrat control of both the House and Senate, now more than ever we must remain united in the fight for life. The pro-life movement has remained staunch in its efforts to defend the unborn, and I will actively continue these efforts throughout this new Congress with this administration.

In 1976, Congress first passed the Hyde Amendment prohibiting the federal funding of abortion. However, since this amendment is not permanent law it must be attached to the annual appropriations bills. Since it was first enacted 45 years ago, Congress has always included Hyde protections as part of the annual appropriations bills and no president has ever vetoed an appropriations bill as a result of the Hyde Amendment’s inclusion. However, Congressional Democrats have sought to repeal the Hyde Amendment for years, expressing a gross ignorance toward the taxpayers who morally disavow the practice of abortion. This opposition to the Hype Amendment is unacceptable, which is why I joined nearly 200 of my colleagues in sending a letter to House and Senate leadership in defense of the Hyde Amendment and other pro-life appropriations provisions. 

The lack of respect for the sanctity of human life we are currently witnessing is disheartening to say the least. I strongly oppose the most recent announcement from the Biden Administration to discontinue PLGHA, also known as the Mexico City Policy, first enacted by the Reagan Administration. This is a crucial policy that prevents nongovernmental groups who receive taxpayer funding from utilizing these funds to perform or lobby for abortion. The PLGHA policy provides the United States the ability to fund global health initiatives without promoting abortion on the taxpayer’s dime. In reversing the rule, this administration is taking a step towards a pro-abortion agenda rather than focusing on the life-affirming health care the world needs in the fight against COVID-19. 

As a society we cannot stand idly by while the sanctity of innocent life is being challenged. I am firm in my commitment to ensuring respect for human life remains a cornerstone of public policy and will continue to support legislation in concurrence with the pro-life movement. I stand in defense of those who cannot defend themselves. Thank you to my fellow Nebraskans and everyone across the nation who are devoted to doing the same.

Dear Fellow Marylander: 
Let’s talk about the COVID-19 vaccine again. Last month, after the first vaccines were approved for use in the United States, I urged everyone to talk to their doctor and get a vaccine as soon as they would be eligible. At the time, we didn’t know exactly how few doses were going to be made available to states and how botched that limited distribution might be. 
Starting at square one, the vaccines being distributed today by Pfizer and Moderna use a protein from the COVID-19 virus to help your body create antibodies to fight the virus and disease it causes. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), after getting vaccinated, you develop an immunity to the disease without having to get it first. Despite the myths out there, you ARE NOT being injected with live or dead virus. 
Studies have shown that the current vaccines, which are administered in two doses, can lessen your chances of getting severely sick by 95 percent, making it one of the best weapons we have in the fight against COVID-19. 
Our scientists followed all the regular clinical research and regulatory approval procedures in the development of this vaccine, and they were able to accomplish such a miraculous fete in record time because federal government funding was in place to back up their work. Do not let the concentrated timeline scare you away from getting the vaccine when you are able. With a choice between serious illness or possible long-term problems due to COVID-19 infection, or taking a vaccine, I would hope most people would choose the vaccine. 
Getting the vaccine into the arms of hundreds of millions of people in this country in a short period of time was always going to be a challenge. 
Unfortunately, Maryland has one of the slowest vaccine rollouts among any state, though it has recently improved relative to other states. Data from the CDC shows Maryland has vaccinated over 7,320 people out of every 100,000. 
As of January 29, the CDC shows that Maryland has received 881,675 doses, though it is unclear how this breaks down between long-term care facilities versus local health departments and hospitals. As of January 29, CDC registered 442,565 doses administered while Maryland’s tracking system registered 483,149 vaccinations including 406,168 first-dose shots. 
Each week, Maryland receives about 70,000-73,000, averaging 10,000 doses a day. As President Joe Biden’s National Strategy for the COVID-19 response and pandemic preparedness plan kicks into high gear, we hope to see those numbers accelerate soon. Previously, there was no reliable plan or distribution system in place to get the vaccine to each state. 
After he was sworn into office, President Biden signed an executive order directing relevant agencies to exercise all appropriate authorities, including the Defense Production Act, to meet all the necessary equipment and material to accelerate the manufacture, delivery, and administration of COVID-19 vaccine. He also directed the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to begin standing up the first federally supported community vaccination centers, with the goal of standing up 100 centers in the next month. The CDC will also launch the federal pharmacy program -- making vaccines available to communities in their local pharmacies. 
All this is to state the obvious: demand for vaccines has far surpassed the supply. There had been no real system in place and the delays are a direct result of the Trump administration’s failure. The Biden administration is working to make up lost ground. 
We have a long way to go and I know how frustrating it has been for Marylanders who thought they were eligible to sign up for a vaccine appointment only to have trouble with the online system or even finding an available appointment once they did enter in all their information. Some people are getting appointments and others are not. There are questions of fairness and ongoing concerns about equity between communities. 
As long as demand outpaces supply, we can all understand that there must be some kind of priority system for distribution. But that plan must be clear and reasonable. Rushing to the next phase before supply can catch up is a recipe for greater frustration. We need more transparency at the federal AND state levels so that everyone as a greater level of confidence in how the limited supplies of vaccine are distributed. 
If I can get any message across to you today, it is to stress the importance for everyone to get vaccinated to protect themselves, but also to protect their family and their community. The more people who are vaccinated, the greater chance we have to get this virus under control. 
Without a vaccine, it will take longer for our schools to reopen safely; businesses, especially restaurants and event venues, will remain shuttered; hospitals will continue to be overwhelmed with patients. As more people become vaccinated, the fewer people who might get sick or have a severe reaction to the virus. And the more we can get back to an almost normal way of living.
I know the frustrations remain. But I urge you to have patience and be ready and willing. All eligible individuals should get the COVID-19 vaccine – both doses. 
Only as a community can we fight back against this deadly virus. 
Thank you and stay safe.   ￼

1/30/21 9:01,Travel Ban,"News from Representative Crawford

Travel Ban
Earlier this week, the Biden Administration issued a Presidential Proclamation that re-instated many of the COVID-19 travel restrictions put into place by the Trump Administration. However, South Africa was added to the list due to the new strand of COVID-19 found in the country. While I will support any efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, the move by President Biden failed to initially acknowledge the significant role of South African H-2A temporary workers. Due to ongoing workforce shortages, thousands of South Africans come to the United States every year and provide critical support to our farmers. Placing travel restrictions on these essential workers would have significantly limited the ability of our producers to continue to provide food, fuel, and fiber to our nation.
Many of our farmers in the First District reached out to me this week with their concerns regarding the travel restrictions. I worked with my colleague, Rep. Frank Lucas from Oklahoma, to build a coalition in the House and ask the Biden Administration to make an exemption for the essential H-2A workers. Thankfully, our voices were heard, and the State Department announced Thursday evening that H-2A workers would be given an exemption to the Proclamation and permitted to travel to the U.S. assuming all necessary COVID-19 precautions are taken.
I appreciate the Biden Administration recognizing the importance of our agriculture supply chain and the important role our H-2A workers play in keeping Americans fed. My colleagues and I followed up with the Administration to thank them for this exemption and to ask them to continue to prioritize our farmers as we fight COVID-19 together.  Click here to view the new OSHA workplace guidance from the Department of Labor regarding COVID-19.

Meanwhile, Reps. Frank Lucas, R-Okla., and Rick Crawford, R-Ark., are gathering signatures of colleagues on a letter to the administration in support of an exemption for H-2A workers. In a note to fellow House members, the two lawmakers say, ""While we support the effort of the administration to limit the spread and exposure to new and existing strains of COVID we think it is vital that there be an exemption in place for essential workers like those who participate in the H-2A guest worker program.""

1/30/21 7:56,Standing Up for Iowans,"  
￼
 
 Home | Newsroom | Helping Iowans | Contact 

WEEK IN REVIEW 
Dear Friend –    As the new Congress gets underway, there’s no shortage of work that needs to get done for Iowans – and I’m continuing to do just that. In the Senate, I’m carrying out my ongoing commitment to deliver for Iowans–from pushing for commonsense immigration reform to standing up for our agriculture community. 
￼ 
Click here or on the image above to watch my remarks. 
Here are some of the highlights from issues I’ve been working on this week:  

Honoring Sarah Root 
Five years ago, a loophole in the law allowed an illegal immigrant who murdered young Iowan Sarah Root to escape the country and evade justice.     Ahead of the anniversary of Sarah’s death, I re-introduced my commonsense bill named in honor of Sarah that requires federal law enforcement to detain illegal immigrants criminally charged with killing or seriously injuring another person. In just his first week in office, President Biden reversed the Trump Administration’s executive order that includes parts of Sarah’s Law. 
￼ 
Click here or on the image above to read my column on Sarah’s Law. 
Sarah’s Law brings us one step closer to restoring justice in our broken immigration system by allowing federal law enforcement to detain and prosecute violent criminals. With my friend Michelle Root by my side, I’m going to keep fighting to get this bill across the finish line—because that’s what any mom would do. 

Standing Up for Iowa Agriculture
When the Obama-Biden administration attempted to regulate nearly 97% of the land in Iowa with their Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule, I fought back and stood up for the livelihoods of hardworking Americans – and led the way on getting a new, more flexible WOTUS rule put in place. Now, the Biden Administration is working at a rapid pace to undo this work.  
As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and the Environment and Public Works Committee, I’m calling on my colleagues to join me in standing with our workers, farmers, manufacturers, and businesses by upholding the Trump Administration’s WOTUS rule.  
￼ 
This week, the Biden Administration also took new action to move toward all-electric vehicles. This raises concerns for states like Iowa that grow and produce clean ethanol and biodiesel.    I’m urging President Biden to instead promote the adoption of higher biofuel blends and invest in expanding biofuel infrastructure that will provide consumers with better access to cleaner, cheaper choices at the pump.  

Investing in Iowa’s Students, Providing More Choice 
As a mother, I strongly believe that all children deserve a chance to achieve success – regardless of where they are born and the situations their families face. 
￼ 
This National School Choice Week, I was proud to help re-introduce the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act, legislation that would increase K-12 and workforce education opportunities by creating a federal tax credit for businesses and individuals who donate to nonprofit school tuition organizations (STOs). 

BONUS READ 
For President Biden and his entire national security team, there must be no days off from securing and protecting our homeland. There should be no appeasement of Iran and its behavior. Even to discuss rejoining the Iran Nuclear Deal right now is unwise. 
￼Click here or on the image above to read my column in the Washington Examiner. 
I urge the incoming Biden administration to make a top priority of keeping our nation and the world safe from the threat of Iranian nuclear missiles. The security of our country and of our allies depends on it.

Q&A: Balanced Budget Amendment
￼
Q: Why did you re-introduce the Balanced Budget Amendment? 
Q: How would a Balanced Budget Amendment function? 
Quick Links
The federal government should not be spending more taxpayer money than it brings in. Almost every state has adopted some form of a balanced budget requirement, and it’s past time that the federal government follows suit. 
I joined many of my colleagues in reintroducing the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. Science shows that unborn children can feel pain as early as 20 weeks post-fertilization. It’s time for Congress to pass this bill and help ensure that these human lives have a real chance. 
If state and local public officials jeopardize the safety and security of the public by refusing to comply with federal immigration laws, they should be held to account. This is why I joined my colleagues in reintroducing the Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act this week. 
I also joined Senator Joni Ernst in reintroducing Sarah’s Law, a bill named for a young Iowan who was killed by an illegal immigrant who was driving drunk. This bill would ensure justice for victims like Sarah.

1/30/21 6:02,A message from staff on Fran Tonko’s passing,"￼

 
Thank you for your Support in this Difficult Time
 
 
January 30, 2021
 Dear Friends,
This week brought the devastating news that Congressman Tonko’s mother, Fran, passed away. She was dearly loved by her family, friends and many in our community. Her warmth and spirit will be remembered and cherished by all whose lives she touched.
The Congressman has spent much of his spare time this week grieving and preparing for her services. He has been moved by the outpouring of love and support that have come in the form of hundreds of calls, letters, notes, messages and comments offering condolences and sharing fond memories of his mother. 
As staff, we thought it would be appropriate to share her obituary for this week's newsletter, which you can read in full here:
Frances G. Tonko, 99, of Princeton Street, Amsterdam, NY died very peacefully on Sunday, January 24, 2021, at the River Ridge Living Center in Amsterdam, New York.
 
Frances was born on April 16, 1921. She was the daughter of Boleslaw and Karolyna Bik Grajewski. She was a 1937 Wilbur H. Lynch High School graduate. She later continued her Post Graduate studies. 
 
On June 21, 1947, she was united in marriage to Stanley C. Tonko. They shared 68 years of married life together. Stanley died on June 28, 2015.
 
Frances had been employed by the Selective Service System and later worked for the Amsterdam Insurance Agency in Amsterdam, NY until her retirement in 1976. 
 
Frances was a lifelong Greater Amsterdam area resident. She was a member of St. Stanislaus Church and the Ladies Rosary Society; St. Mary’s Club 60 and a past member of the Montgomery County Women’s Democratic Club. She was appreciated as an energetic campaigner. 
 
Frances had been recognized in the past by former Governor Mario Cuomo as “New York Blood Donor of the Year”. She took great pride in her vegetable and flower gardens. She was a great baker and cook. There were great demands for her delicious pierogi, lasagna, babka bread, and lemon meringue pie. Frances was an avid lover of animals including her own Victor and Vanessa.
 
Frances is survived by her children, Patricia Tonko and United States Congressman Paul D. Tonko, both of Amsterdam; niece and goddaughter, Gayle Grajewski of Amsterdam; niece; Diane Nichols of Orange Park, Florida; nephews, Dr. Edward Rubinski of Vero Beach, Florida; Richard Rubinski of Norman, Oklahoma; four grandnieces, one grandnephew and two great grandnieces.
 
Frances was predeceased by her brother, Joseph B. Grajewski and his wife Elizabeth; sister, Jessie Jurusik and her husband John; sister-in-law, Victoria Rubinski and her husband Edward.
 
Fran’s family offers thanks for the compassionate care provided by her medical staff and healthcare workers whose efforts filled her life with dignity and hope.
 
Thank you for your thoughts, prayers, and kindness. Stay safe. 
 -Staff

Vaccine Updates and More
 
January 29, 2021
  
Dear Neighbor,
 
I remain committed to doing all that I can to help our community get vaccinated. Unfortunately, there has been a troubling trend of racial inequity in the rollout of the vaccine. I am pushing for more doses and more testing sites in our communities, free and safe transportation to vaccine sites, and more capacity on the phone lines where people can schedule vaccine appointments. I have been communicating with federal, state and local agencies to push for more immediate action on these issues. 
 
Sigo comprometida a hacer todo lo posible para ayudar a nuestra comunidad a vacunarse. Desafortunadamente, ha habido una tendencia preocupante de injusticia racial con la distribución de la vacuna. Estoy insistiendo para más dosis y más sitios de pruebas en nuestra área, transporte seguro y gratuito y a los sitios de vacunas, y más capacidad en las líneas telefónicas donde la gente harán sus citas de vacunas. 
 
In this newsletter you will find COVID vaccine information, resources in our community and updates from DC including environmental Policy Updates.
If you no longer live in the district, or want to unsubscribe from this newsletter, please click here. 
  
 
COVID-19 Vaccine Updates and Information  
 
  
The vaccine supply is extremely limited in L.A. County. While we wait for more doses of the existing vaccines to be made available and a potential single shot option in the months ahead, we must continue to take all precautions. I encourage you and your family to get the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available and you are eligible. Los Angeles County’s Vaccine Distribution page describes the phases and tiers of vaccination, with more information about how these phases will roll out.    
  
As a reminder, L.A. County residents 65 and older are now eligible to receive the vaccine. Healthcare Workers, Staff & Residents at Skilled Nursing Facilities, and Staff and Residents at long-term care facilities are also eligible to receive the vaccine. 
 
You can find out when it is your turn to receive a vaccine by signing up on the statewide ‘My Turn’ website.   
￼
  
As the vaccine is still a limited resource, appointments at each vaccination site are limited. To make an appointment for yourself or a loved one, visit www.Vaccinatelacounty.com. If you aren’t able to make an appointment online, call 1(833) 540-0473. You should also check with your local clinic or healthcare provider and ask if they will have access to the vaccine.
 
Again, vaccines are still very limited and in high demand. Expect delays on phone lines and high traffic on websites. Please try the sites at different times of the day, since appointments are being added on a rolling basis. I recommend checking the website every morning because new appointments are being added every day. Know that officials are aware of the technical difficulties and are working to fix them. 
 
¿Se pregunta cuándo será elegible para recibir la vacuna COVID-19? 
  
Es importante que todos reciban la vacuna COVID-19 cuando sean elegibles. 
 
La página de Distribución de Vacunas del condado de Los Angeles describe la fases y niveles de vacunación, y con más informació sobre cómo se implementarán estas fases.  
   
Debido al impacto severo que la pandemia continúa teniendo en nuestros vecinos y familiaress mayores de 65 años, el condado de Los Angeles ha priorizado el grupo de edad, haciéndolos elegibles para recibir la vacuna. Las personas que trabajan para el Programa de Servicios de Asistencia en el Hogar (IHSS) que atienden a pacientes también son elegibles para recibir la vacuna. Haga una cita como trabajador de la salud con anticipación y someta la documentación necesaria, como prueba de empleo de IHHS y una forma de identificación.
   
Como la vacuna sigue siendo un recurso limitado, las citas en cada centro de vacunación son limitadas. Para hacer una cita para usted o un ser querido, visite www.Vaccinatelacounty.com. Si no puede hacer una cita en línea, intente llamar al 1-833-540-0473. También debe consultar con su clínica o proveedor de atención médica y preguntar si tendrá acceso a la vacuna.
  
￼
  
Visite VaccinateLACounty.com para obtener información actualizada sobre las vacunas COVID-19 y para averiguar cuando será elegible para recibir una. 
 
Puede averiguar cuando es su turno de recibir una vacuna registrándose en el sitio web estatal ‘My Turn’.
 
Espere retrasos en las líneas telefónicas y mucho tráfico en los sitios web. Recomiendo consultar el sitio web todas las mañanas porque cada día se agregan nuevas citas. Pruebe los sitios en diferentes horarios del día, ya que las citas se agregan de forma continua y sepa que los trabajadores oficiales están al tanto de las dificultades técnicas y están trabajando para solucionarlas.

Vaccine Scams
 
Be aware of vaccine scams, here are the facts about the vaccine in L.A. County. 
 
Estafas de Vacunas
 
Tenga en cuenta las estafas de vacunas, aquí está información correcta sobre la vacuna en el condado de Los Angeles:
  
COVID Vaccine Telephone Town Hall Report Back
 
On Tuesday, we held a Vaccine Telephone Town Hall with Supervisor Janice Hahn and L.A. County Public Health’s Dr. Seira Kurian. If you missed the event, you can listen here. Supervisor Hahn answered many of the FAQs on her Twitter account the following day.
 
Información de el Foro Telefónico de Vacunas
 
El martes, tuvimos una reunión telefónica sobre la vacuna contra el COVID con La Supervisora Janice Hahn y la Dra. Seira Kurian de Salud Pública del Condado de Los Angeles. Si se perdió el evento, puede escucharlo aquí. 
 
Transportation and the Vaccine
 
Lack of transportation should not be a barrier to getting your vaccine. All of the pharmacy and clinic locations are walk-up, and drive-thru sites, like the big County-run sites, will accommodate walk-ups.
	•	Several ride sharing apps are also offering free or discounted rides to vaccination sites. Check your apps for more information. 
	•	Fiesta Taxi is offering South Gate seniors free transportation to the Downey Vaccination site. 
  
￼
  
Transporte y la Vacuna contra el COVID  
 
El transporte no debe ser un obstáculo para recibir su vacuna. Hay varios lugares donde no necesita un automóvil para vacunarse. 
 
	•	Varias aplicaciones para viajar en auto también están ofreciendo viajes gratuitos o con descuento a los sitios de vacunación. Revise sus aplicaciones para obtener más información. 
	•	Fiesta Taxi ofrece transporte gratuito a las personas mayores de edad de South Gate al sitio de vacunación en Downey.
Affordable Rideshares
 
Last December, Metro Micro launched a ride share program allowing passengers to travel anywhere within a specific service zone for only $1 per ride. The first service zones were designated for the LAX area and the communities of Watts and Willowbrook. This week, Metro Micro expanded to three new service zones, including one which will cover Compton and California State University, Dominguez Hills. More information here. 
 
En diciembre del año pasada, Metro Micro lanzó un programa de viajes en auto que permite a los pasajeros viajar a cualquier lugar dentro de una zona de servicio específica por solo $ 1 por viaje. Esta semana, Metro Micro expandió. Ahora servirá en las comunidades de Watts, Willowbrook, Compton y la Universidad de California, Dominguez Hills. Más información aquí.
  
 
COVID-19 & Resources in Our Community
 
Stay at home order status
 
Governor Newsom has lifted the stay-at-home order and announced that all counties in California will be moving back to a system of colored tiers.
 
L.A. County will be in the highest-risk tier, purple. This means that, although outdoor dining is now open, the risk of spread is still very high and restrictions are still in place.  
 
Orden de estadía en casa
 El gobernador Newsom ha levantado el orden de estadía en casa. Aunque los restaurantes de comer al aire libre están abiertos, el riesgo de infección es todavía muy alto y las restricciones todavía están en su lugar. 
 
Types of Masks 
 
Please keep wearing your masks! Experts always recommend the N95 mask if you have access to one. If you don’t, it’s always best to double-mask, or use a mask with three or more layers. If you’re using cloth masks, remember to wash your masks frequently and cycle between different ones. 
 
Los Tipos Recomendados de Mascarillas     Expertos siempre recomiendan la mascarilla N95 si tiene acceso a una. Si no, siempre es mejor usar doble mascarilla o usar una mascarilla con tres o más capas. Si usas mascarillas de tela, recuerde lavarla con frecuencia y alternar. 
 
Outbreak at our Ports 
 
I’ve been very concerned about the recent outbreak of COVID-19 at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. This outbreak impacts my constituents and their family members who work there, the  surrounding communities, and could have catastrophic consequences on the local and national economy that depend on the ports. 
  
Congressman Alan Lowenthal and I joined together in writing a letter to the State and County to highlight the importance of prioritizing port workers in vaccine distribution. It’s critical that we protect the essential workers who keep our port infrastructure operating and our goods flowing.
￼
  
Brote en nuestros puertos
  Me ha preocupado mucho el reciente brote de COVID-19 en los puertos de Los Angeles y Long Beach. El congresista Alan Lowenthal y yo escribimos una carta al estado y al condado para insistir la importancia de dar prioridad a los trabajadores del puerto en la distribución de vacunas.

CA Eviction Moratorium Bill Extended through June 30th, 2021
 
California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law on Friday that extends eviction protections through the end of June. Tenants who qualify for the protections will still owe their rent, they just can’t be evicted for not paying all of it. The law would use federal stimulus dollars to pay off 80% of some tenants’ unpaid rent, but only if landlords agree to forgive the remaining 20%. If landlords refuse the deal, the law would pay off 25% of tenants’ unpaid rent to make sure they qualify for eviction protections.
 
People who earn more than 80% of the area median income are not eligible for the money.

The Federal Response to COVID-19
 
President Biden has announced a comprehensive COVID-19 plan, which includes buying millions of new doses of the vaccine that will hopefully be available in the summertime. Negotiations over the next coronavirus relief plan continue. I will continue to push for regular, direct payments, expanded unemployment benefits, small business support, and rent/utility relief. 
 
El Gobierno Federal en respuesta a COVID-19 
  
El presidente Biden ha anunciado un plan extenso de COVID-19, que incluye la compra de millones de nuevas dosis de vacunas, que se espera que sean disponibles este verano. Las negociaciones sobre el próximo plan de alivio de coronavirus continua. Yo sigo insistiendo por pagos regulares, directos, beneficios de desempleo expandidos, ayuda para negocios pequeños y alivio de alquiler. 
 
Environmental Policy Updates 
 
This week was a busy one for environmental justice and climate action. President Biden announced several Executive Orders on climate and environmental justice, which I am proud to see and happy to support.
  
￼
I reintroduced the Energy Resilient Communities Act with Rep. Yvette Clarke. The bill invests in 100% clean energy microgrids to help communities fight climate change and keep the lights on after extreme weather events such as wildfires and hurricanes. 
 
I reintroduced the Climate Smart Ports Act to invest in pollution reduction at ports across the country, including the Port of Los Angeles.
  
I also led a letter with 26 of my colleagues asking President Biden to reverse a last minute decision by the Trump administration to eliminate funding for urban parks in underserved communities. 
 
Actualizaciones de Política Ambiental    Esta semana, el Presidente Biden anunció varias órdenes ejecutivas sobre el clima y la justicia ambiental, que estoy orgullosa y contenta de apoyar.    Reintroduje la Ley de Comunidades Resistentes a la Energía para luchar contra la crisis climática con la Congresista Yvette Clarke.    También reintroduje la Ley de Puertos Climáticamente Inteligentes para invertir en la reducción de la contaminación en puertos de todo el país, incluido el Puerto de los Angeles.    Finalmente, dirigí una carta pidiéndole al presidente Biden que cambiara la decisión de la Administración Trump que hizo a última hora de eliminar fondos para los parques urbanos en comunidades de pocos recursos.

1/29/21 20:32,Senator Bennet’s Weekly Update,"A message from Senator Michael Bennet 
￼
Coloradans,  
What a difference a week can make. Since the inauguration last Wednesday, we have seen real progress on several fronts. Beyond President Biden’s initial steps to fight the pandemic that I mentioned last week, he’s also moved to expand access to health care, promote racial equity, restore science in federal policymaking, reverse the ban on military service for transgender Americans, and much more.  
This week, the president took several steps to combat climate change, which threatens our health, economy, and way of life in Colorado. He’s directed federal agencies to buy American-made, zero-emission vehicles, initiated a “whole of government” approach to the climate crisis, and proposed my “30x30” idea to conserve at least 30 percent of federal lands and waters by 2030. 
This is a good start, but we have a lot more to do. We should seize the opportunity to create jobs and protect our outdoor economy through strong vehicle standards, energy efficiency, and new investments in our forests and watersheds –– the natural infrastructure of the West. At the same time, we have to invest in rural communities that are undergoing energy transitions to spur growth and create jobs, and on Tuesday I urged the Biden Administration to make this a priority in a new relief package. 
I look forward to working with the new administration to make sure that, as the world takes on so many unprecedented challenges, America is leading the way.
Best, 
￼  Michael 

RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE
I’ve heard time and again from Coloradans that they’re working as hard as they can but still can’t afford some combination of housing, health care, child care, and other essential needs. That’s why I introduced a bill this week to create a $15 federal minimum wage that will phase in gradually over the next four years so small businesses have time to adjust. This bill is about making sure everyone who works full-time can live with dignity, and it’s one one of many steps we need to build an economy that creates opportunity and security for everyone.
￼ 

FIGHTING FOR SPACE COMMAND 
Earlier this month, the Air Force announced that Huntsville, Alabama would become the permanent headquarters for U.S. Space Command instead of Colorado Springs. Reports later surfaced that the Trump Administration made the decision based on politics. Moving Space Command to Huntsville would undermine America’s national security and superiority in space. Colorado is home to significant space missions, one of the country’s largest private aerospace industries, and many supportive communities. It is the clear choice for Space Command’s permanent home, and it’s why I led Colorado’s entire congressional delegation to urge President Biden to suspend and review the decision. 
￼ 

BRINGING THE BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT TO COLORADO 
For years I have urged the federal government to relocate the headquarters for the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to Grand Junction, which would not only grow the Western Colorado economy but also signal that rural America is the right place for such a prestigious institution. Although the previous administration committed to relocate BLM’s headquarters, it did not adequately follow-through on its decision -- waiting until the last minute for key decisions and assigning the barest resources. Last week Senator Hickenlooper and I wrote to the Biden Administration reiterating our support for a full BLM headquarters in Grand Junction and called for the staff and resources needed to get this done.

Dear Friends,
 
I want to thank everyone who joined my first virtual town hall of the year last night. In case you missed the event, I wanted to share some of the top questions we received, and my responses. You can also watch the full event here. 
	•	Do you think the Senate should abolish the filibuster? Yes, it should. This has been something that has undercut progress for years and I hope we can get rid of it. 
	•	Do you think Former President Trump should be convicted by the Senate? Absolutely. We lived at the crime scene and we saw it. I think it’s time to hold him accountable even as he tries to slink out of town to Mar-a-Lago. 
	•	Do you think Marjorie Taylor Green should be expelled from Congress? No question. This woman is unbalanced, and I think almost criminally insane. She has no place being in the United States Congress. 
	•	How do you think the vaccine rollout is going? It’s not good enough. We need more. We need more of it in the arms. Here in Oregon I hope we can get somebody in charge to move it forward. This is something we can’t afford to not do right. We need to do more work to make it smoother and faster.  
	•	What is the latest status of the $2,000 stimulus checks? As you know, we struggled with the Republican Senators to be able to get the $2,000. There was $600 first and then it was a battle to get the next $1,400. We are fighting to make sure we have reoccurring payments. Many of the problems that we are facing in our community and around the country is simply that people don’t have money. Until we are able to return to normal, there is no substitute for putting money in people’s pockets. 
	•	Do you support statehood for Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico?  Absolutely. You know, we saw the problems for Washington, D.C. not having the power of a state that delayed the ability to get the national guard in a state of emergency. If it was a state that wouldn’t happen. That’s yet one more reason to empower the voters of Washington, D.C. to have their own Senators and a voting member of the House
	•	Do you support Medicare for All? Yes.
	•	Do you think we will be able to legalize marijuana finally? We ended the last Congress on a high note, passing the MORE Act that I’ve been working on for years, that would fully legalize. We passed legislation to have safe banking, even research. Just today I talked to Senator Booker who’s going to lead on our MORE Act in the Senate. We’re optimistic that we’ll get the job done this year. 
Thank you again to everyone who joined the town hall. As a reminder, you can hear the rest of the discussion in my virtual town hall replay here.  
 
I’m hopeful we can have more conversations like this as we work together in the new Congress and with the Biden administration to deliver results. If you have a suggestion for a future town hall topic, I’d love to hear from you.
  
Courage,
￼

Hi Lindsey,

The Moore You Know
While partisan battles and frustrations have largely consumed our first few weeks in Washington, as the great Robert Frost once said, “I have promises to keep, and miles to go before I sleep.” My faith and your prayers will provide strength and guidance in the long and difficult road ahead. We’re just getting started - and I’m ready to work on behalf of the wonderful Alabamians I proudly represent.
The Moore You Know, the better. I’ve promised to be transparent with folks back home and I intend to keep that promise. Please subscribe to stay informed on my thoughts and activities during my time in Congress.
We hope you also follow our journey on social media by clicking the links below.
Keep reading for the full update. Have a blessed week.
Sincerely,
￼
Congressman Barry Moore

HIGHLIGHTS
 
￼
 
Taking the Oath of Office
Standing on the House floor on January 3rd with a stack of family bibles, I swore to uphold the Constitution and serve the great people of Alabama’s Second Congressional District.
As a veteran and small business owner, I am humbled by the opportunity to serve my state and represent the voices of my constituents in the People's House. From reining in Washington's runaway spending to protecting the unborn, our nation's problems can be solved through prayer and hard work. Excited for our journey ahead.

January 6th
On January 6th, we witnessed a tragic breach of our nation’s historic Capitol building. No matter the circumstances, I will always strongly condemn political violence. I’m grateful for Capitol Police and other law enforcement officers who bravely defended the Capitol - including USCP Officers Brian Sicknick and Howard Liebengood, who both passed after the chaos. I encourage you to join me in praying for their families.
After the Capitol was secured that night, we returned to the House floor to finish consequential duties. Guided by the Constitution, I joined dozens of my House colleagues in objecting to accepting the electoral college votes from states with clear voting irregularities. While we were not successful, several of my fellow Republican freshmen and I remain focused on restoring election integrity. Since Alabama proudly leads the nation in ensuring only legal votes are counted, I will highlight our successful policies as examples for other states to follow.

￼
 
Voting Against Impeachment
Since Democrats’ move to push through a resolution to pressure Vice President Pence to invoke the 25th amendment didn’t work, they decided to impeach President Trump for a second time with just seven days left in office.
The impeachment process was once the most solemn action Congress could take against a sitting president. Now, we’ve seen impeachment proceedings carry on without any committee hearings or a full investigation. This ultimately cheapens the entire process and sets a dangerous precedent for future impeachments.

First Trips Across the District
While I never dreamed our journey would be off to such a divisive start in Washington, coming back home reminds me what this work is really all about.
Over the last week, I enjoyed productive trips to Sweet Grown Alabama, Alabama Eggs and Poultry Association, Alabama Cattlemen's Association, Alabama Forestry Association, and Morris Builders. I look forward to visiting all across our district throughout my time defending the values of the Alabamians I represent.

Greetings,
Since the Supreme Court made Roe v. Wade the law of the land in 1973, more than 61 million babies have lost their lives through legal abortions. This atrocity has gone on long enough. Life is the most basic right of every man and woman created in the image of God and the first right guaranteed in our Declaration of Independence.
 
Now, the Hyde Amendment, a bipartisan agreement prohibiting taxpayer funded abortions in Medicaid since 1976, is under attack from the radical left. The American people do not want the Hyde Amendment to be revoked. Studies show the majority of Americans oppose taxpayer-funded abortion and support at least some restrictions on abortion. 
 
In addition, President Biden has announced an end to the Mexico City Policy, which prevents taxpayer funds from being used to promote abortion as women’s health care overseas – a restriction 75% of the American people support. While he preaches unity, President Biden ends one of the few policies agreed upon by the majority of Americans. This only serves the will of radical Democrats, not those he claims to represent.

 
I believe in supporting not only the unborn, but also the women and families who are in difficult situations so that abortion is never the only choice. Thousands of non-profits across the nation offer resources and financial assistance to women who need help during their pregnancy. Adoption is always a fantastic option, with about 2 million couples currently waiting to adopt. That is 36 couples for every child placed for adoption.
 
Join me in standing up for what is right and protecting the most vulnerable among us. Speak out in your communities in defense of the voiceless, and let women know they always have the option to choose life. 
Until next week,
￼

Dear friend,
As the dust settles in Washington, D.C. with the first full week of a new administration, my priority remains serving San Diegans and supporting them through this pandemic. Although we've learned much about this virus in the past few months, the situation is still evolving and we need to keep our guard up. Please do your part to stay safe and keep those around you safe as well.
I continue my work in the district to stay in touch with the people I represent. Below is another update on some of the work my staff and I have done this week to serve you.

Legislative work
Reintroduction of OPRA II
This week, I re-introduced the bipartisan Ocean Pollution Reduction Act II (OPRA II) with the full support of San Diego's congressional delegation. This bill simplifies the City of San Diego’s required permitting process to operate the Point Loma Wastewater Treatment Plant (PLWTP). It also solidifies the region’s water security, and further cuts the amount of wastewater that flows into the ocean from the plant. OPRA II was originally introduced in 2019, and it passed the House in November 2020 by an overwhelming vote of 395-4, but the Senate did not take action on the bill before the end of last year.

District work
San Diego in DC meeting
￼
On Wednesday, I hosted the first virtual San Diego in DC event of 2021. Key San Diego leaders, including Rep. Mike Levin and Rep. Sara Jacobs, and representatives from major public and private institutions in our region joined this event. We discussed upcoming projects and priorities for San Diego this year.

San Diego County COVID-19 vaccine information 
COVID-19 vaccination events hosted by the county are currently open to healthcare workers, others in all tiers of Phase 1A, and people age 65 and older.
Vaccine appointment registration is required and space is limited. If you don't see appointments available at your nearest site, check back regularly for updates and openings.
Click here to make a vaccine appointment.

￼
Join us next Wednesday for a virtual town hall event with two San Diego experts to discuss vaccine efficacy and distribution. We will also answer attendees' questions on this pressing issue. To attend, click this link. The event will also stream live on my Facebook page.

ICYMI: Column and op-ed on my efforts to fight climate change 
Last year's bipartisan energy package was just the start of an evolving action plan to combat climate change. I've shared the climate efforts I'm leading this Congress with the San Diego Union-Tribune in a column this week and an op-ed in The Hill. My list of priorities includes reducing methane emissions, cutting black carbon pollutants, continuing to scale back hydrofluorocarbons (HFC) use and modernizing our national power grid. There’s no doubt that science-based policies will help us tackle one of the greatest crises of our time. The full San Diego Union-Tribune column can be found here and my op-ed in The Hill can be found here.

NEW: Participate in our weekly poll!
Starting this week, we'll include a poll for our e-newsletter readers to weigh in on a relevant topic. Here's this week's poll question:
Do you approve of President Biden's wide-ranging executive orders during his first days in office?
Click here to submit your answer via Google Forms. We'll reveal the results in next week's e-newsletter. We appreciate your engagement and feedback.

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or need assistance with a federal agency, reach out to us through our website or by calling the district office at 858-455-5550.

Mourning the More Than 1,000 Granite Staters Lost to COVID-19
This week, our state reached a heartbreaking milestone when the thousandth Granite Stater lost their life to COVID-19.  The virus has taken too many too soon, and my prayers are with every Granite Stater who has lost a loved one. To all who are struggling right now, whether because you have lost a family member, are newly unemployed, or are facing mental health challenges brought on or exacerbated by the pandemic – please know that you are not alone.  As we mourn together as a state, I urge all Granite Staters to continue to support one another, and, even as vaccines become more available, remember that it is still critical that we wear masks and practice social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus and save lives.  I will continue to work with Republicans and Democrats, as well as the Biden administration, to provide the additional health and economic relief that our country needs. I also appreciate that the administration announced this week that it will reopen the Affordable Care Act’s online marketplace – which will help ensure that more Americans have access to affordable health care during the pandemic.  By continuing to work together and following public health guidelines, we can and will get through this. 
With every good wish,  ￼   Senator Maggie Hassan 
What the Senator is Working On
Senator Hassan, along with Senators Todd Young (R-IN), Susan Collins (R-ME), and Tim Kaine (D-VA), reintroduced the bipartisan Gateway to Careers Act to help expand economic opportunity for hard-working Americans and support innovative businesses in need of a strong workforce. This bill to support career pathways is the first bill Senator Hassan introduced this Congress. Learn more here.  Senator Hassan and Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) introduced a bipartisan bill to support the National Guard’s role in helping state and local governments safeguard  their cybersecurity infrastructure.  Read more here.  New Hampshire breweries applauded bipartisan efforts that Senator Hassan helped lead to permanently extend the reduction in excise taxes for craft breweries in the government funding and COVID-19 relief package. Senator Hassan successfully worked to temporarily extend these tax cuts in the bipartisan government funding bill in 2019 and to permanently extend this tax relief at the end of 2020.

Her goal was to inspire students with her love of learning — and while her life was cut short, that legacy lives on in classrooms throughout New Hampshire and the country.  This week, the Christa McAuliffe Commemorative Coin became available for pre-order. All proceeds will go to the FIRST Robotics program, furthering STEM education. Senator Hassan joined Senators Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) and Mike Enzi (R-WY) in pushing for this small memorial to a phenomenal woman.

1/29/21 18:47,Major Action to Tackle COVID-19 and the Climate Crisis,"￼ 
  

Dear Neighbors,
It’s been a busy week! President Biden promised to increase vaccine supplies to states and signed Executive Orders to make health care more affordable and accessible and to tackle the climate crisis head on. I also want to pass along important announcements on COVID-19 vaccines and economic assistance in New Jersey. You can find them at the end of this newsletter. 
Responding to the COVID-19 Pandemic
On Monday, President Biden announced that the federal government would increase vaccine supplies to states and improve transparency so that states know in advance how many doses they are receiving. The federal government will also purchase 200 million more doses of COVID-19 vaccines, which would allow for the full vaccination of 300 million people.
Making Health Care Affordable and Accessible
President Biden signed two Executive Orders this week to expand access to quality, affordable health care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, access to health care is essential in the fight against this public health crisis. The President directed the reopening of the Healthcare.gov marketplace to ensure Americans can sign up for coverage. In New Jersey, eligible residents can click here to sign up for a plan through May 15.  
President Biden also took the first steps toward reversing the policies of the last four years that undermine protections for people with pre-existing conditions, make it harder to enroll in health care, increase the cost of insurance coverage, and take health insurance away from some of the most vulnerable. I look forward to assisting the new Administration’s efforts to unwind these harmful, and often illegal, changes and to working together on policies that strengthen, protect, and expand access to health care. Read more here
Confronting the Climate Crisis
President Biden’s Executive actions on the climate crisis finally give this crisis the attention it deserves at the national level. These orders will help spur the creation of new good-paying jobs, secure environmental justice, and pause new leases for onshore and offshore oil and gas drilling on federal land and water. 
The climate crisis is an opportunity to empower our workers with new, good paying jobs that can’t be shipped overseas; to prioritize the needs and the voices of our environmental justice communities; to revitalize our energy communities with the support they need to rebuild from this pandemic; and to return our economy to a position of strength after a long, dark year of historic job losses and pain. I look forward to working with the Biden Administration to explore ways we can permanently ban offshore drilling as we transition our country to a clean, low-carbon future. 
I’m proud to stand with the president in this effort and join him in saying: now is our time to act. We will not stand idly by as the rest of the world transitions to clean energy and our workers get left behind, and we will not watch from the sidelines as the climate crisis wreaks havoc on Americans’ health and homes. Read more here 
This week, I went to Perth Amboy with Governor Murphy to see New Jersey’s first community solar project. Projects like these make it clear that we don’t have to choose between fighting climate change and economic growth. I’m proud that our state is leading the way on our path toward a clean, low-carbon future as we invest in green, good-paying jobs right here at home. 
Delivering for New Jersey 
I announced this week that New Jersey will receive $216 million from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for costs associated with storage, transport, distribution, and administration of COVID-19 vaccines. The funding will be distributed to the New Jersey State Police who are working with the New Jersey Department of Health to distribute and administer COVID-19 vaccines. As vaccines become more widely available, I’ll continue to work with the Biden Administration so that everyone can get vaccinated. Read more here 
I’m pleased that New Jersey’s commercial and recreational fishing industry is finally receiving funding that I fought to include in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. Our fishing communities have been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, which is why I fought so hard to include robust funding in the CARES Act and have worked to ensure that funding is distributed to those who need it most. Read more here 
Local COVID-19 Announcements
An important announcement for New Jerseyans who have received their first COVID-19 vaccine dose: 
New Jersey has automatically scheduled second vaccine doses for those who have received their first dose by registering through the state’s online portal.
If you booked directly with a vaccine site for your first dose and did not book your second dose appointment at the time of your first shot, then you need to contact the site where you received that first shot to schedule your second. If you are still not certain how you will get your second dose appointment, contact New Jersey’s Vaccination Call Center at 855-568-0545 and operators will assist you with scheduling one. 
The New Jersey Economic Development Authority is launching Phase 2 of its Small Business Emergency Assistance Loan program. The program will make up to $100,000 in low-interest financing available to eligible small businesses and nonprofits in New Jersey. Pre-registration begins February 10 at 9 AM. Click here to learn more 
Eligible uninsured New Jersey residents will have another opportunity to enroll in health insurance plans until May 15, 2021. Go to getcovered.nj.gov for more information. 
New Jersey’s Department of Human Services is extending COVID-19 childcare assistance programs through the end of February. The Department will also continue to waive co-pays in the state’s childcare subsidy program for parents who request it due to impacts from COVID-19. Click here for more information

Dear friends and neighbors, 

Like the rest of the country, Central Floridians are eager and ready to defeat the coronavirus. We understand that you deserve a continued urgent response to get our country through this challenging period and towards recovery. That’s why House Democrats, along with the Biden Administration and Democratic Senate, are working to get you and your family the relief you deserve. Already, President Biden has issued Executive Orders that will help save lives and livelihoods during this crisis, including by: 
	•	launching a safe, effective vaccination campaign;
	•	using the Defense Production Act to speed up delivery of PPE and vaccines;
	•	expanding testing, treatment and the public health workforce;
	•	safely reopening schools, businesses and travel;
	•	improving health equity especially for communities of color;
	•	ensuring mask-wearing and other science-based steps to stop the virus’s spread;
	•	delivering relief by extending moratoriums on evictions, foreclosures and student loan payments, by strongly expanding food assistance for hungry families and by strengthening the ACA and expanding access to affordable, quality health care.

While there’s still work ahead of us, we can all work together to crush the virus by getting vaccinated. As of today, Floridians who are eligible can now pre-register for a vaccine appointment.  
￼

After registration, individuals will be notified when appointments become available in their area. The vaccine is safe and effective, and I encourage everyone eligible to get vaccinated. Our community is counting on you!

Remembering a Hero

Our community mourns the loss of Chief Master Sgt. Richard Hall, a distinguished member of the Tuskegee Airmen and Central Florida native. We are deeply grateful for his invaluable commitment to serving our country and extend our sincere condolences to his family and friends. 

I was lucky enough to call Richard a dear friend and will forever remember our conversations about his time during World War II. Particularly, I will cherish our interview for the Veterans History Project with the Library of Congress. May his memory live on.

Working to Bring Patriot Spouses Home 
￼

In 2018, Polk County resident Alejandra Juarez — the wife of an Iraq combat veteran and the mother of two U.S.-born daughters — was deported from the United States to Mexico as a result of the Trump administration's zero-tolerance immigration policy. 

﻿This week, her 11-year-old daughter Estela and I wrote letters asking President Biden to take executive action and direct the Department of Homeland Security to grant her parole and allow her to come home to her family. 

If this swift action is not taken, I am hopeful that my bills, H.R. 163 and H.R. 495, will help Alejandra and other veteran spouses return to the United States. 

We will not stop fighting until the Juarez family is reunited!

Fighting for our Precious Florida Coral Reefs 
￼

Our Florida coral reefs contain some of the most diverse ecosystems on earth, and it is our responsibility to ensure that they are protected from the effects of climate change, overfishing, pollution and development. With this in mind, I proudly introduced the bipartisan Restoring Resilient Reefs Act of 2021, H.R. 160.

This crucial piece of legislation would reauthorize the Coral Reefs Conservation Act, which authorizes five years of federal funding and technical assistance to states, territories and local communities for the maintenance and restoration of coral reef ecosystems. 

I am proud to be a part of this effort and look forward to working with my colleagues in the House of Representatives and Senate to get it passed through both chambers and signed into law by President Biden. 

Additional Vaccine Resources

As COVID-19 infections rise in Central Florida, we are working with local officials to provide up-to-date information on vaccinations. For more information on your county's distribution plans, please visit the websites linked below.

Demand for the COVID-19 vaccine is far in excess of the supply the state has received so far. It is anticipated that additional supplies will be coming soon. Florida has many sites that are providing COVID-19 vaccines to eligible persons, but supplies are limited and appointments may not be available at many of these sites. The state is prioritizing persons 65 years of age and older and health care personnel with direct patient contact and residents and staff of long-term care facilities. Please be aware that some locations are only serving very specific populations, such as frontline health care workers. Appointments may be required and vaccine availability will vary from day to day and week to week, as we work to provide vaccines to the most vulnerable first.

In the face of unprecedented challenges, Central Floridians in our community have shown immense courage. From the heroic efforts of our healthcare workers and first responders to our essential workers and teachers, each of you has helped our community get through the coronavirus crisis. I am proud to be your representative and look forward to our continued efforts to improve our district.

1/29/21 18:32,"Weekly Wrap-Up: COVID-19 relief, healthcare costs","￼

Dear Lindsey,   This week, I've continued to work to deliver pandemic relief and lower healthcare costs for Central Virginians, particularly as it relates to COVID-19 treatments and therapies. Please keep reading for a brief recap of my work. Thank you for sharing in our efforts to deliver on the priorities of Virginia's Seventh District. I am always grateful for the opportunity to serve our communities.
  
 
TOWN HALL
 
  
This Wednesday, I held a telephone town hall to hear directly from Central Virginians about the issues facing our families, businesses, and communities. We were able to discuss the need for additional COVID-19 relief, the Virginia vaccine rollout, and many more issues that are important to our Seventh District neighbors. Thank you to everyone who joined. If you couldn't make it, you can watch the recording below.
  
 
￼
 
  
 
WHAT I'M WORKING ON
 
  
This week, I introduced a bipartisan bill to protect consumers on private health insurance from the high costs associated with COVID-19 antibody therapies and infusions. I have heard directly from concerned Virginians about the out-of-pocket costs of antibody treatments. The Protecting Patient Access to Lifesaving COVID-19 Drugs Act would require that private plans cover these treatments with no cost-sharing – just as they do with COVID-19 testing. No American should be forced to decline necessary healthcare, simply because they fear potential costs. READ MORE
 
I also introduced the RESET for America's Future Act, bipartisan legislation to provide USDA with additional tools to better align the SNAP Education & Training program with the workforce training needs of our communities. In order to come out of this pandemic stronger than before, we must focus on both improving our nation's workforce development programs and increasing access to critical programs like SNAP E&T, or Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program Employment & Training. READ MORE
 
On Tuesday, I joined a bipartisan group of colleagues in the Problem Solvers Caucus for a conversation with White House National Economic Director Brian Deese about the administration's relief package and how Congress intends to move forward. I am glad to see that the new administration has a clear focus on the needs of our families and communities. We must continue to move forward with additional relief for families and a strategic plan for vaccine distribution. While the Biden Administration announced a 15 percent increase in vaccine supply to states, we still need far more doses to reach essential workers, senior citizens, nursing home residents, and other vulnerable individuals here in the Commonwealth.
  
 
TRUST IN CONGRESS ACT
 
  
WATCH to learn more on my TRUST in Congress Act that was reintroduced last week, requiring Members of Congress and their immediate family members to put their investments in a blind trust while in office:
  
 
￼
 
  
""The bipartisan TRUST in Congress Act would set guidelines to prevent not only actual impropriety, but also the appearance of impropriety. It is difficult to see how anyone in either party could oppose this."" - Larry Sabato, Director, University of Virginia Center for Politics
  
 
IN OUR DISTRICT
 
  
Our constituent services team is here to advocate for all our neighbors in the Seventh District who are having issues with a federal agency. Whether or not we agree on every issue, my office works for you, and we are committed to doing so in any way that we can.
 
Since taking office in January 2019, my team has closed 1,772 constituent cases and returned $4,506,444 in backlogged benefits to Central Virginians.
 
To open a case with us, complete this form online or give us a call at (804) 401-4110.
  
I know that this last month has been particularly hard for our country and our democracy. I want to remind you once more that my team is always here for you. If you need assistance or want to make us aware of a challenge you are facing, call my office at (804) 401-4110 or (202) 225-2815.
 
I will continue to work on the issues and challenges that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, including skyrocketing healthcare costs, rising drug prices, and disparities in healthcare access and coverage for Virginia's minority and underserved communities. We will make it through this pandemic, and we will be stronger than before.
  
Sincerely,
Abigail

Follow the Science. 
﻿Reopen Schools.
￼

Friend, 
 
Last December, then President-elect Joe Biden made a pledge to reopen schools within his first 100 days in office. This was a long-overdue step given that the data made clear in-person learning was not driving spikes in Coronavirus cases, but I was encouraged by his commitment to meeting this goal. 

This week, however, the Biden Administration seems to be reversing course. Despite the overwhelming evidence supporting reopening schools, President Biden’s Chief of Staff declared in an interview that it was unsafe to do so unless Congress provided billions more in funding. And Dr. Fauci even said that President Biden’s push to reopen schools within his first 100 days “may not happen.” 
 
This is insane. 
 
Congress has already provided billions of dollars to states specifically for the purpose of reopening schools. And this week, the CDC made clear that nearly all evidence suggests schools can reopen safely if they take common-sense safety precautions. 

Despite the best efforts of our teachers, virtual learning is literally failing students across the country. In fact, last month the Green Bay Area Public School District reported that students were failing at nearly twice the rate than the year before. 

We need to follow the science and get kids back in school. 
 
At the beginning of this crisis, I called on Wisconsin school districts to come up with plans that ensure kids don't fall behind and students can return to school safely. Nearly one year later, there's no more time for excuses. We simply can’t afford to keep schools closed any longer.

Week of January 24, 2021   TEXAS NATIONAL GUARD

On Monday, I wrote a letter to Texas Governor Greg Abbott applauding him for instructing Major General Tracy Norris to call the Texas National Guard back home.

Last week, several news outlets reported that National Guard troops were expelled from a Capitol office building and forced to rest in a parking garage with only one electrical outlet, one bathroom, and no internet reception. This is unacceptable and I am outraged that these service members who dropped everything to protect us could be treated so poorly.

As Texans, this is not how we are taught to treat those who willingly serve in defense of our nation. I commend the Governor for taking action to support our servicemembers and ordering Texas National Guard members home after this disgraceful treatment.

Read my full letter here.  
 


MARCH FOR LIFE
 
In honor of the tens of thousands of pro-life Americans that are coming together virtually today at the March for Life, I am proud to reintroduce the Teleabortion Prevention Act and The Child Custody Protection Act. 

With the Biden Administration already rolling back important live saving policies, it's more important than ever that we continue to be a strong voice for the voiceless. Both these bills help prevent the destruction of unborn life, safeguard women’s health, and protect the conscience rights of millions of Americans. The sanctity of life has been my top priority and an issue I will continue to devote my life protecting.

COMMITTEES FOR THE 117TH CONGRESS
 
This week we received our committee assignments for the 117th Congress!

I am proud to continue serving on the House Foreign Affairs Committee and the House Education and Labor Committee under the leadership of Rep. Michael McCaul and Rep. Virginia Foxx.

On the Education and Labor Committee, we must remain committed to getting students back in the classroom. The scientific evidence is clear and the education, mental health, and well-being of our students are at stake. It's time to safely open up America's schools. We also need to work to continue putting forward policies that give our job creators and workers the tools they need to get back on their feet after the pandemic. 

On the Foreign Affairs Committee, I look forward to working with my colleagues, old and new, to promote freedom & democracy around the globe while holding authoritarian regimes, like Communist China, accountable.

HUMAN TRAFFICKING AWARENESS MONTH
 
January is Human Trafficking Awareness Month, and as the month comes to an end, it's more important than ever that we continue raising awareness for this form of modern-day slavery. 

Here are the facts:
- There are currently 313,000 victims of human trafficking in Texas (234,000 are victims of labor trafficking.
- There are 79,000 victims of youth and minor sex trafficking in Texas at any given time.
- There are up to 40 million enslaved people across the globe.

Contact the National Human Trafficking Hotline to connect with services and support for human trafficking survivors, or to report a tip: call 1-888-373-7888, text 233733, or chat online.

NATIONAL PRAYER BREAKFAST
 
Next week on Thursday, February 4th, the 69th National Prayer Breakfast will take place at 8AM. 

This event is traditionally held in the nation's capital, with members of Congress and other elected officials. This event brings family and friends from every continent together in prayer. 

You can join the event online at 2021nationalprayerbreakfast.org

 

COVID-19 VACCINE INFO

Many of you have recently reached out to me regarding COVID-19 vaccine distribution in Tarrant, Ellis, and Navarro Counties. As your Congressman, the health and safety of our district continues to be my top priority and I wanted to pass along some important information on vaccination efforts in our community. 

The Texas Division of Emergency Management has a statewide COVID-19 vaccine provider map that shows all Texas vaccine providers. This map provides contact information for each provider as well as the number of available doses each provider has of the COVID-19 vaccine. 
 
If local supplies are limited, all Texans are able to register for any vaccine hub in Texas. To register to receive the COVID-19 vaccine from a vaccine hub visit the Texas Department of State Health Service website. Registration is also available on the Tarrant County Public Health website. If Dallas County is preferred, please visit the Dallas County Health and Human Services website to register for the COVID-19 vaccine.

1/29/21 18:29,A Heartbreaking Milestone,"￼

 
January 29, 2021
 
 
Dear Friend,
 
No words can fill the void left in the lives of those who have lost a family member, friend, or community member to COVID-19. This week, our state crossed the heartbreaking milestone of 1,000 deaths as a result of this virus. My thoughts are with the families and loved ones of the 1,022 Granite Staters who have lost their lives. More than 430,000 Americans have died as a result of this virus, and nearly 26 million have been infected. These numbers are staggering, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. We have two safe, highly effective vaccines for COVID-19 that are being produced and distributed to combat this deadly virus, and today we learned that another promising vaccine may be available soon. But like most Americans, I’ve been frustrated with the slow pace of the vaccine rollout. 
 
There’s no greater public health priority than administering the vaccines to Americans as quickly as possible – as a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, this is my top priority. This week, I introduced bipartisan legislation to improve our nation’s immunization information systems and ensure the efficient and equitable distribution of vaccines in the Granite state and across the country. Last week, I introduced legislation to increase our efforts to manufacture and distribute the COVID vaccines and support the Biden-Harris administration’s efforts to get shots into arms.
 
I’m encouraged that President Joe Biden’s plan to crush this virus and Build Back Better prioritizes the acceleration of vaccine manufacturing, distribution, and administration while ensuring that no American will incur out of pocket costs. I look forward to working with the administration to bring that plan to fruition.
 Over the past year, our state has shown immeasurable courage and grit to support our neighbors and communities during this public health crisis. I know that through our collective strength and commitment to protecting one another, we can get through this pandemic together. You can read my full op-ed in the Concord Monitor here.

Discussing the Immunization Infrastructure Modernization Act on WMUR
 
Efficiently and equitably distributing the COVID-19 vaccines requires coordinated, strategic leadership from the federal government, and the Biden-Harris administration has demonstrated that they are up for the task. Yesterday, Representative Larry Bucshon and I introduced the Immunization Infrastructure Modernization Act  to bolster and quicken our nationwide vaccine rollout. I’m proud to introduce this bill to improve our nation’s immunization information systems and support the administration’s comprehensive plan to get America through the COVID-19 pandemic.

Doing My Part to Prevent Blood Shortages During the COVID-19 Pandemic
 
 
￼
  
 Donating blood on Wednesday 
 On Wednesday, I donated blood at a Red Cross blood drive in Concord. Almost a year since the beginning of this pandemic, we are still dealing with its consequences, including its impact on our nation’s blood supply. Even as COVID-19 disrupts our daily lives, the need for blood donations has remained consistent. Be it for essential surgery, transfusions, or ongoing treatments, donors are needed to ensure blood is available when necessary. I was glad to do my part by donating this week, and I encourage all healthy Granite Staters to consider donating. The New Hampshire Red Cross holds blood drives almost every day, and those who would like to donate can visit their website to register. 
 
 
 
Expanding Access to Quality, Affordable Health Insurance
 
 I’m pleased President Biden announced that he will reopen the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) online marketplace, HealthCare.gov, this week. No one should be forced to choose between their health insurance and putting food on the table. Access to affordable, quality health insurance for all Granite Staters is crucial, especially during a public health crisis like COVID-19. I’m glad to see President Biden put the needs of Americans first and I will continue working to ensure individuals and families in New Hampshire have the support they need to get through this pandemic. 
 
 
 
Addressing the Climate Crisis
 
 As we continue working to crush the COVID-19 pandemic, we are also in the midst of a climate crisis. Inaction is not an option, and I’m pleased that the Biden-Harris administration is already taking meaningful steps to address climate change. I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress and the administration to advance essential environmental legislation to protect our planet for future generations. You can read more about the administration’s actions on climate here. 
 
 
 
Providing Utility Debt Relief to Those Who Need It Most
 
 
￼
 I joined Rep. Peter Welch this week to introduce legislation that will provide $10 billion in utility debt relief for Americans struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic. Even before COVID-19 hit, many families in the Granite State and across the country struggled to pay their utility bills. The coronavirus pandemic has put additional stress on many households, creating a more widespread challenge during the cold winter months. We cannot let our most vulnerable citizens go without the essential utilities they need during this public health crisis. The Energy Debt Relief for American Families Act would help families stay connected to the services they need while preventing other ratepayers from ultimately paying off their debt. I urge my colleagues to support this beneficial bill. 
 
 
 
Remembering Christa McAuliffe
 
 
￼
  
The Crew of the Challenger
 Yesterday, our nation marked 35 years since the Challenger disaster, which took the lives of seven people, including Concord High School teacher Christa McAuliffe. Christa was an exceptional person who reached for the stars and inspired her students to do the same. I was honored to help efforts in the House of Representatives to create a commemorative coin to keep Christa’s pioneering spirit alive as she continues to spark a passion for science and exploration among younger generations.

Taking Action to Ensure Equal Pay for Equal Work
 
 
￼
 Equal work should equate to equal pay, regardless of gender. It is unacceptable that in 2021, on average, women make 81 cents for every dollar their male counterparts make. This isn’t just an issue for women, it’s about families and communities that are missing out on hard-earned pay. We cannot allow American families who count on a woman to support them to suffer from pay discrimination. I am proud to co-sponsor and help reintroduce the Paycheck Fairness Act to bring our country one step closer to ensuring that women receive equal pay for equal work, and I urge my colleagues to support this crucial legislation. 
 
 
 
Taking a Stand Against Bigotry and Hatred
 
 This week, the world paused to observe International Holocaust Remembrance Day, on the 76th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. We honor and grieve for the millions of innocent men, women and children killed during this horrific and shameful period in human history. It is vital that we never forget what happened - we must remain committed to fighting against bigotry and hatred and work to build a more inclusive and accepting society for all people. 
 
 
￼
 
 
News You Can Use
 
 
Sign-ups for Phase 1B of New Hampshire’s COVID-19 vaccination process are now open. Phase 1B opens vaccine registration to:
	•	Those 65 years or older
	•	Those under 65 but medically vulnerable
	•	Residents or staff of residential facilities
	•	Correctional officers working in facilities
Confirm your eligibility and register for your vaccination on www.vaccines.nh.gov/. If you need assistance, you can call 2-1-1 for help. 
 
I was honored to nominate 26 talented young men and women this week to attend our nation’s esteemed military academies. Preparing for military service is an admirable but difficult endeavor, and these students have shown they are up to the task. I know they will make our state and our country proud! 
 
I’m thrilled the Biden-Harris Administration reversed the bigoted and cruel discriminatory policy set in place by the previous administration that banned transgender Americans from serving openly in our military. Our military members represent the best among us, and any brave, qualified individual willing to serve our country should be able to.
 
It is encouraging that Defense Secretary Austin ordered an assessment of sexual assault in our military. Our service men and women give so much to our country, and it is our responsibility to ensure they are protected and treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. I will continue working to end sexual assault in our military and hold those responsible for such crimes accountable. 
 
The COVID-19 pandemic has had an outsized effect on women and girls - and the only way we are going to build back from this pandemic and pave a path forward for a better future is if we address the economic, opportunity and social disparities facing women and girls. I’m glad President Biden established a White House Gender Policy Council to focus on uplifting the rights of girls and women, and look forward to working with the administration to ensure all Granite Staters have a chance to get ahead. 
 
As always, the CDC and the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services are the best resources to turn to during the COVID-19 public health emergency. If you are sick, stay home and call your health care provider. If you live in NH and have questions about coronavirus, dial 211 or visit CDC.gov for more information.
 
To stay updated on my work in Congress and around the Granite State, as well as for important information and resources, like my page on Facebook and follow me on Twitter. 
 
Remember: hope and brighter days are on the way! We’re all in this together, and we will come out stronger on the other side. I hope you have a fun and safe weekend!
 
Sincerely, 
 
Annie

More vaccine on the way

The Marianas will receive another 7,800 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in the first week of February, it was announced this week. This will bring the total doses of the Pfizer vaccine to 21,450. Each individual needs two doses, 21 days apart, for maximum effectiveness. The Marianas will also receive 3,200 doses of the Moderna vaccine in the February allocation, 33 percent more than January’s allocation, for a total of 8,200 doses. Moderna, too, requires two injections for full effect. The Moderna vaccine increase comes after the Biden Administration announced plans to purchase an additional 100 million doses of both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccine, increasing the total vaccine order for the U.S. from 400 million to 600 million doses. The announcement also pledged greater transparency in the vaccine distribution process. Vaccine distribution data by jurisdiction for both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines can now be viewed publicly on CDC’s website. 
￼
￼

More money for schools, teachers

One thing is for sure: schools will need more money from the federal government to help students make up lost instructional time and to pay teachers and staff in the middle of the continuing financial crunch that the Marianas and other state-level governments face because of the pandemic. This week I introduced a trio of bills to fill that need, along with colleagues on the Education and Labor Committee. Our Learning Recovery Act provides schools with funds to cover the cost of extending the school year, school days, or summer school to help students catch up on their learning. Our Save Education Jobs Act will deliver an estimated $50 million to pay Marianas Public School System teachers and staff in fiscal year 2021. And our Reopen and Rebuild America’s Schools Act provides $90 million for the Marianas to invest in the physical and digital infrastructure we need to get learning back on track. Read more on our education recovery package here. 
￼

H.R. 560: permanent status for workers

On Thursday, I reintroduced legislation to grant permanent status to certain Commonwealth-only Transitional Workers (CWs) and to foreign investors, who were originally admitted under Commonwealth immigration law. Similar legislation, also numbered H.R. 560, passed the House in the last Congress, but died in the Republican Senate. In addition to making long-term workers and investors eligible for permanent residence in the Marianas, the new Northern Mariana Islands Legal Residents Relief Act of 2021 gives those eligible for this permanent status under P.L. 116-24 another chance to apply and makes certain family members eligible, too. After five years, persons with Marianas permanent residence status could apply for U.S. permanent residence. The new H.R. 560 addresses concerns with implementation of P.L. 115-218, the Northern Mariana Islands U.S. Workforce Act, including clarifying congressional intent on touchback timing, extending the validity of an approved Commonwealth occupational survey, and increasing the time for CWs to apply for visas to enter the Marianas. My bill also ensures Marianas permanent residents and CWs can get relief and assistance in the aftermath of natural disasters. 
￼
￼

More time to respond to USCIS

On Thursday, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced another extension of time to respond to certain requests, notices, and decisions dated between March 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021. The agency will consider responses received within 60 calendar days after the due date stated in the document. Requests for Evidence (RFE), Continuations to Request Evidence (N-14), Notices of Intent to Deny, and Notices of Intent to Revoke, are among the eligible documents. Additionally, a Form I-290B received within 60 calendar days from the date of decision will also be considered, if the decision was made between March 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021. These accommodations are part of the agency’s continuing effort to minimize the impact of COVID 19 on immigration applicants.

1/29/21 17:57,Leading Locally,"￼
Services  |   Contact  |   Events

Dear Neighbor,
 
A new Congress brings new opportunities, and just as we did over the last two years, we are focused on leading locally, listening to our community and working to solve problems for our district and the people of Colorado. Over the last two years, we held 46 town halls and hosted countless community conversations to hear from you, an to hear your challenges, concerns and ideas. Already, several of these conversations have turned into bills that we've introduced in Congress to address the issues that you've shared with us. 
 
Ally's Act is the first bill we reintroduced in the 117th Congress, and it highlights local leadership at work. 
 
ALLY’S ACT EARNS SUPPORT FROM SENATOR WARREN
  
 
￼
 
 
Ally's Act is a bipartisan bill we wrote, inspired by 11-year-old Ally, a constituent from Broomfield, Colorado. When Ally wrote my office about an issue she was having with her insurance provider, we got right to work to write a bill that would address the issue. For Ally and so many others, specialized hearing devices like cochlear implants and bone-anchored hearing aids (BAHA)'s are critical for communicating. While these devices are necessary for every day life, many insurance providers deny coverage for them. 
 
It has meant a great deal to me to be able to work with Ally and her family, and I am incredibly grateful for Ally’s initiative and courage to bring this issue to my office. I look forward to continuing to represent her and many others as we work to get this bill passed.
 
NEXT GENERATION VOTES ACT
 
Our democracy is strongest when voting is simple, easy and accessible for everyone who is eligible. This is why I reintroduced the Next Generation Votes Act in the 117th Congress. 
 
This bill is inspired by work done here in Colorado. Coloradans have led on efforts to offer pre-registration for young people so they are prepared to vote when they turn 18. The Next Generation Votes Act takes this successful program nationwide and ensures all 16 and 17-year olds have access to pre-registration.
 
￼
Young voices are essential to our democracy. Allowing 16 and 17-year-olds to pre-register 
to vote nationwide ensures that more voices are heard, and therefore our country’s governing body is functioning at its best. 
 
A NEW ERA FOR CLIMATE ACTION
 
This week, I also reintroduced our resolution that calls for a national commitment to addressing the biodiversity crisis. The U.S. and the globe are currently facing an unprecedented biodiversity crisis. Recent scientific studies have confirmed human-driven activities are significantly damaging Earth’s ecosystems, altering marine environments, exploiting wildlife and plant species, accelerating climate change and polluting air, land and water. We must address this  crisis on a national level, and this resolution is a first step in the right direction. 
 
Climate change is the existential threat of our time. If gone unchecked, it will continue to impact our communities, and our lands and forests across Colorado. Earlier this week, President Biden took decisive action to tackle the climate crisis and preserve our public lands. 
 
His executive orders encourage the creation of Civilian Climate Corps, something we have been advocating for for months, through the 21st Century for Our Health and Our Jobs Act. He also took action to move the U.S. towards conserving 30% of our lands and oceans by 2030 and safeguarding science, two proposals we have been leading on. 
 
I look forward to working with President Biden to achieve these goals as a member of the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis. These policies will benefit Coloradans and will provide vital pillars of support as we work to preserve our treasured public lands and build a clean energy economy for our future.
 
President Biden also took action this week to reopen open enrollment through the health care marketplace. 
 
Uninsured Coloradans can now enroll for health insurance coverage February 8th through May 15th. Visit ConnectForHealthCO.com to learn more. 
 
WE STAND READY TO ASSIST YOU 
 
If you need assistance with a federal agency or have ideas on how to help Coloradans and Americans thrive in our country, please contact my office. It is through you that myself and my office serve to the best of our ability. 
 
I hope you all are enjoying the new snow and staying healthy!
 
Sincerely,
￼

West Virginia Needs to be Prioritized for More COVID Vaccine
By leading the nation in vaccine distribution, West Virginia has shown what good planning and attention to detail can do.
That's why I am proud to join the West Virginia delegation in sending a letter urging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to prioritize our state in its next round of COVID vaccine distribution.  Click here, to learn more on the letter sent to HHS. 

Biden's Executive Climate Orders
Stopping energy production on federal lands will have virtually no impact on our climate, and merely makes us more reliant on foreign energy sources. Did they consider the impact on states and communities who rely on this crucial revenue to fund schools, EMS services, and other essential local programs?
These actions are just part of their broader effort to do away with fossil fuels no matter the consequences to our economy and our security. The people who live in communities across the country, from the coalfields of West Virginia to the oil patch of New Mexico, are just collateral damage. No window dressing of a working group to help these areas in the transition can change that.
Instead of further destroying rural America and putting our economy at risk, we need to focus on policies that utilize innovation to reduce emissions while allowing us to use our rich supply of American energy.
Click here to read more on President Biden's Executive Orders. 

ICYMI: Named Ranking Member on Environment and Climate Change
Being chosen to serve as Ranking Member is a great honor and recognition of our leadership and work on energy issues over the last ten years. This subcommittee will be the tip of the spear in fighting the Biden Administration and Democrat Majority’s extreme climate change policies.
Their goal of stopping the use of fossil fuels in the power sector by 2035 is not feasible and would decimate our economy. We will work to protect jobs and America’s economic competitiveness while developing alternative solutions that focus in American ingenuity and innovation.
I look forward to continue my work with Ranking Member Cathy McMorris Rodgers and our team, as well as finding areas of agreement with my colleagues across the aisle. 
The Subcommittee’s Jurisdiction includes:
	•	Clean Air Act and air emissions;
	•	Soil, air, and water contamination, including Superfund and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act;
	•	Regulation of solid, hazardous, and nuclear wastes, including mining, nuclear, oil, gas, and coal combustion waste;
	•	Regulation of drinking water (Safe Drinking Water Act), including underground injection of fluids (e.g., deep well injection or hydrofracking);
	•	Toxic substances (Toxic Substances Control Act);
I will also serve on the Subcommittees on Energy and Oversight and Investigations subcommittees.

West Virginia Strong - The Comeback Plan
Over one hundred and thirteen thousand COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in West Virginia as of today. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources established a toll-free hotline for questions from the public and medical providers concerning the pandemic. The department also has a website with the most up-to-date information regarding the confirmed and pending cases. 

In May, Governor Jim Justice announced his plan for reopening the economy. Reopening will not happen suddenly, but with time. We should be able to open in a safe and cautious manner as long as we continue to follow the social distancing guidelines. 

The STAY-AT-HOME order was lifted on Sunday, May 3rd and a SAFER-AT-HOME was put in place on Monday, May 4th. 

                    West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources
                                              Toll-Free Hotline 24/7

CDC Recommendations
We encourage everyone to follow the CDC recommendations on how to help protect yourself and others.

Take these steps to protect yourself:
	•	Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, which the chorus to Country Roads lasts about that long.
	•	Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
	•	If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% of alcohol.
	•	Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
	•	Put distance between yourself and other people if COVID-19 is spreading in the community.
	•	Wear a cloth face covering in public settings.
Take these steps to protect others:
	•	Stay home if you are except to receive medical care.
	•	Cover coughs and sneezes with tissues and throw away the tissue.
	•	Clean and disinfect touched surface areas daily.

Dear fellow East Tennesseans,

This week I met with folks here in East Tennessee. I also received news of my committee assignments for the 117th Congress. I’m excited to share this news and other updates with you below, and please consider following me on Facebook and Twitter to stay informed. And if there’s anything my office can assist with, please visit my website and contact us. 
 
IN THE NEWS
Harshbarger appointed to House Education, Homeland Security committees

￼

CONGRESSWOMAN HARSHBARGER DISTRICT MEETINGS
During this district work week, I had the pleasure of meeting with small business owners and workers, county officials, and public servants from Carter, Cocke, Hamblen, Hancock, and Hawkins Counties. It’s always great to hear from folks about the issues important to them and our communities. Some of my highlights include:
	•	Meeting with Nancy Barker of the Rogersville/Hawkins County Chamber of Commerce
	•	Lunch at Michael’s Diner in Sneedville
	•	Visiting Greene’s Tractor in Sneedville
	•	Meeting with a great group of local officials and public servants in Elizabethton
	•	Meetings with Hamblen Schools Director Dr. Jeff Perry and TCAT Morristown President Jerry Young
	•	Meetings with local officials in Cocke County and the city of Newport to discuss local economic development

￼

MEETING WITH THE KINGSPORT CHAMBER OF COMMERCE
Friday morning, I had a great meeting with the Kingsport Chamber of Commerce where I was able to give a quick update on what’s going on in Washington. It was also great to see Senator Marsha Blackburn and our other local elected officials!

￼

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ANNOUNCEMENT WITH GOVERNOR LEE AND EASTMAN CHEMICAL
It was great to join Governor Bill Lee and Eastman Chemical CEO Mark Costa for Eastman’s announcement on their plans to build a plastic-to-plastic molecular recycling facility here in Kingsport. Eastman is a hallmark of East Tennessee, and I look forward to working with them to foster a pro-business environment.

STATEMENT ON JOINING THE EDUCATION & LABOR AND HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEES
This week, I was honored to be appointed to the House Committees on Education and Labor and Homeland Security. Read my full statement here.

￼

NATIONAL SCHOOL CHOICE WEEK
I had the pleasure today to meet with the Hopson family to hear about how they have benefitted from homeschooling and to raise awareness about school choice options. I believe students and their parents should be empowered with the freedom to find the best K-12 education fit for their individual learning needs, whether that is a traditional education, homeschooling or another option that works best for them.

STANDING UP FOR LIFE
I am unapologetically pro-life. This week, I took the following actions to stand up for the rights of the unborn.
	•	I signed on to a letter in support of saving the Hyde Amendment and pledging to vote against any bill that would fund abortions. 
	•	I signed a letter urging President Biden to reconsider his decision to end the Mexico City Policy, which prevented U.S. foreign aid from going to NGOs that fund or promote abortions. 
	•	I also co-sponsored the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act that would ensure that infants born alive after an abortion receive the same protection of law and degree of care as any newborn.
	•	Click here to see a video of me and some of my fellow House Republicans discussing why we’re pro-life.

IMPORTANT COVID RELIEF CHECK INFORMATION
If you’re eligible for a COVID stimulus relief check and have not yet received it, it may be because you need to file a 2020 tax return to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit. You have a few options on how to do this, according to the IRS:
	•	You can use one of the IRS Free File partners to electronically file a 2020 tax return and claim your credit; or
	•	In early February, you can use the IRS’ Volunteer Income Tax Return Locator tools to find somewhere local to get free tax help; or
	•	Or, you can file a paper Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR and claim the credit on line 30. The Instructions for Forms 1040 and 1040-SR provide information starting on page 57 on how to compute your credit.

INFORMATION ON COVID-19 VACCINES
For detailed information on vaccine availability and other COVID-19 resources in Tennessee, check out the state’s website, covid19.tn.gov. The site is updated daily, and you can check on vaccine availability, which populations are currently being served, and register for appointments in counties that offer them. You can find the county-specific information here. Additional COVID resources and information can be found at https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.

Committee Assignments

￼

I'm excited to announce that this Congress I'll be serving on three committees: the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the House Small Business Committee, and the House Science, Space and Technology Committee. These committee assignments will allow California's 39th District to have a voice on several important policy issues. I also joined the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus and look forward to getting to work and delivering bipartisan results for my constituents. 

Visiting Orange County Super POD Vaccination Site
￼

I visited the Disneyland Super POD vaccination site yesterday before the rain! Our health care workers, first responders & volunteers are working hard to get all eligible people COVID-19 vaccines in Orange County. I'll continue to work to expand vaccine access in our community. 

Vaccines are currently available for Los Angeles, Orange, and San Bernardino county residents ages 65+. Visit my website for more information HERE. 

Helping our Small Businesses
￼

Our small businesses continue to face challenges during COVID-19. I visited Eureka Pizza in Yorba Linda to learn more about their experience. I look forward to fighting for our CA-39 small businesses on the House Small Business Committee & making sure they get the relief they deserve. If you're a small business in need of help, I encourage you to contact my office. We are here to help you. 

Supporting our Dockworkers

I wrote a letter to Governor Gavin Newsom, state health officials and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors 

The San Pedro Port Complex makes up a quarter of our nation’s total exports, 40% of containerized imports and processes $2 billion in goods each day. Slowdowns due to COVID-19 infections have already caused a bottleneck of dozens of ships filled with goods and supplies waiting to be unloaded. Further delays and terminal shutdowns will have a negative impact on our already fragile economy.

My team and I are here to serve you. As always, please do not hesitate to reach out to my office with any questions or concerns. I encourage you to follow me on social media on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram at @RepYoungKim.

1/29/21 17:39,Weekly Recap→ Protecting Utah’s Public Lands from Federal Overreach,"￼
￼    January 20 - January 29, 2021 
Roughly two-thirds of Utah is owned by the federal government, which puts our state at a disadvantage when it comes to decisions on management of our public lands. Within the past week, the President has issued a series of executive orders regarding public lands that are detrimental to Utah. Senator Romney and the Utah delegation teamed up with state officials to strongly oppose these actions, and subsequently introduced legislation in the Senate to push back against federal overreach. This week, Senator Romney also continued to advocate for the unborn and defend the dignity of life by re-introducing several important pro-life pieces of legislation. Keep scrolling for more updates from the week. 
￼    National monuments have become a political football that gets tossed back and forth as presidential administrations change. Senator Romney and the Utah congressional delegation joined state officials in strongly opposing the recent executive order to review Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante. The legislative process, not the stroke of a pen, is the best way to end this political back and forth. In an effort to keep advocating for state and local input in public lands decisions, Senators Romney and Lee also reintroduced the PURE Act, which would protect Utah from presidential Antiquities Act abuse.    The Utah congressional delegation and state officials also joined forces to urge the President to reconsider his decision to suspend energy leases on federal land. Senator Romney then joined colleagues in introducing the Protecting our Wealth of Energy Resources (POWER) Act of 2021, which would prohibit the administration from blocking energy or mineral leasing and permitting on federal lands and waters without Congressional approval, saying: “The economic impacts of the suspension of oil and gas leasing on federal lands will be devastating to Utah’s rural communities, tribes, and small businesses. And they will be detrimental to Utah’s energy industry, which is struggling to stay afloat and keep Utahns employed during the pandemic.""   
￼
 Full story by Addy Bink here.    ￼    The lives of our children, both born and unborn, deserve our protection. This week, ahead of the March for Life, Senator Romney joined colleagues in introducing several pieces of legislation to protect society's most vulnerable. Senator Romney advocated for the Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act, which would ensure that a child who survives an abortion receives necessary medical care, just like any other baby. He helped reintroduce the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, legislation to prohibit abortions at 20 weeks, the point at which scientific evidence suggests an unborn child is able to feel pain. Senator Romney and colleagues also reintroduced the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, which would make restrictions on using federal taxpayer dollars to fund abortions permanent.  
￼
  Full story by Lee Davidson here.   
￼
  It remains imperative that Congress continue to resist efforts to pack the Supreme Court and treat it as if it is one of the elected branches of government. Our society is only as strong as its institutions and Congress must continue to ensure the integrity and independence of the Supreme Court. Senator Romney and colleagues reintroduced a bill they had proposed last Congress, which would maintain the number of seats on Supreme Court at nine.  
￼
  Full story by Dennis Romboy here.   
￼
  Part of China’s strategy is to invest in countries—and in regions like Africa—not for economic benefit, but for increased geopolitical control. During a Foreign Relations Committee hearing considering the nomination of Linda Thomas-Greenfield to be the U.S. Representative to the United Nations, Senator Romney and the nominee discussed the need for the U.S. to proactively invest in these countries so that they do not have to make the difficult decision to partner with the Chinese.  
￼
  
￼
  Amid reports that organizers for the Summer Olympics in Tokyo were facing challenges in their efforts to continue hosting the Games, Senator Romney, who led the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, issued the following statement in support: ""Hold the Tokyo Olympic Games. Athletes have trained a lifetime to be at their peak. Limit in-person spectators—most of us watch the Games on TV anyway. The world awaits the inspiration of great competition and global sportsmanship.""

Dear Friends, 

I hope you are staying healthy and doing well. With two safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines being distributed and many more in development, we can see the light at the end of the tunnel. As we begin the 117th Congress, my focus is on delivering COVID-19 vaccines, safely ensuring all of our students can have in-person learning, and rebuilding the economy with an emphasis on small businesses. I am committed to serving you and helping rebuild, renew, and restore our great country. 

Health Subcommittee Leader

￼
Rep. Guthrie speaking at E&C

It's an honor to be selected to serve as Republican Leader, or Ranking Member, of the Energy and Commerce Committee's Health Subcommittee for the 117th Congress. The Health Subcommittee has broad jurisdiction over the health care sector and federal health agencies, such as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Last Congress, I was the Ranking Member of the Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. In this role, I spearheaded oversight efforts of our country's COVID-19 response efforts. I held hearings on COVID-19 vaccines and worked with top public health officials on the pandemic response. I also developed recommendations on the health care supply chain in addition to COVID-19 testing, vaccines, and surveillance through a series of reports called the Second Wave Preparedness Project. In this new leadership role, I will first and foremost work on stopping the COVID-19 public health emergency through safe and effective vaccines and targeted response efforts. I will also work to combat the opioid crisis, lower health care costs, and put forward policies that spur health care innovation. I will bring all of my COVID-19 response oversight experience and more than a decade of work on the Health Subcommittee to this new leadership role to help defeat the invisible enemy and advance legislative priorities for Kentuckians in the Second District.

Vaccines

￼
 Rep. Guthrie receiving a dose of the COVID-19 vaccine

Kentuckians are beginning to receive safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines thanks to Operation Warp Speed, scientists, health care professionals, volunteers in clinical trials, and many others. I want to thank all the individuals who helped with vaccine research and development, including those who participated in the clinical trial in Bardstown. I encourage everyone to take the vaccine, in consultation with your health care provider, when it becomes available to you. Rolling up our sleeves to get vaccinated is how we will ultimately defeat this terrible virus. I was vaccinated for COVID-19 at the recommendation of the Office of the Attending Physician in the U.S. Capitol. I publicized being vaccinated to help encourage confidence in the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.

I was pleased to support funding for states to help with vaccine distribution in the Bipartisan-Bicameral Omnibus and COVID Relief Package, which was signed into law on December 27 by then-President Donald Trump. I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress, and I stand ready to work with Governor Andy Beshear and the Biden administration to find opportunities to get more people vaccinated.

Paycheck Protection Program

Small businesses are struggling due to the negative impacts of the COVID-19 public health emergency. I was proud to vote in support of reopening the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) in the Bipartisan-Bicameral Omnibus and COVID Relief Package. This program has served as an important lifeline for small businesses and has helped workers get their paychecks. Originally, PPP provided more than $5 billion in forgivable loans to Kentucky businesses. With $284 billion in additional funding from the last COVID-19 relief bill, Kentucky small businesses can apply for a loan or request a second draw of the PPP loan. For more information, click HERE.

COVID-19 Updates

As always, my office and I stand ready to help. If you need assistance with any federal agency, please click HERE or call 1-270-842-9896 to contact my office.

Foxx Report
 
The United States has faced insurmountable debt for years, and unfortunately, it has gotten to the point where the American people now believe it will never be remedied. Future generations will bear the brunt of wasteful spending that we’ve become all too accustomed to accept, and it should never be that way. Sadly, Democrats in Congress are set to take up a $1.9 trillion taxpayer-funded shopping spree that’s been proposed by the Biden Administration. The train has gone off the tracks here in Washington, and you won’t believe what’s hidden in this proposal. Hardworking taxpayers and families must be respected, and this new stimulus package is just another textbook definition of wasteful government spending. Click here to find out more about what’s in Biden’s $1.9 trillion plan.
Will this “rescue plan” help safely reopen schools? Will it empower America’s workforce? Will it move the economy in the right direction? Those questions all receive a resounding answer: NO. What’s staggering is that the appetite for more spending in Washington never ceases. Congress passed two massive relief packages in 2020, and now there are calls for more money to be spent even when the impacts of that relief are still being assessed.
In Congress, I’ve put my money where my mouth is. I led a revolt on the House floor against the big bank “TARP bailout” in 2009.  I’ve introduced the only comprehensive bill in Congress to rein in “mandatory” spending – the Spending Safeguard Act. And I cosponsored and voted for the largest rescissions package in history, the Spending Cuts to Expired and Unnecessary Programs Act. When it comes to even the smallest iota of wasteful spending, I will always speak up in strong opposition.
Rest assured, I will continue to fight against misguided proposals and policies that put your hard-earned dollars and livelihood at risk. 
Save The Hyde Amendment!
This week, I was proud to join 199 of my colleagues in sending a letter to Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, Leader Schumer, and Leader McConnell demanding that the Hyde Amendment and other current-law, pro-life appropriations provisions remain protected from Washington Democrat repeal efforts. The sanctity of life must be respected, and I will always serve as a strong voice against any efforts that run contrary to the preservation and protection of life. Here’s an excerpt from our letter:
“The Hyde Amendment alone has saved the lives of over 2 million innocent babies and continues to protect the conscience rights of a vast majority of Americans opposed to publicly funded abortions. We cannot allow the Hyde Amendment and other important pro-life safeguards to be decimated by Congressional Democrats.
Accordingly, we pledge to vote against any government funding bill that eliminates or weakens the Hyde Amendment or other current-law, pro-life appropriations provisions.”

1/29/21 16:52,Putting climate front and center,"￼
January 29, 2021
Dear Friend,
We have known for decades that we need to act aggressively to confront the climate crisis that threatens our land, our water, and our children's future. The science of what we are facing--and what we must do--is unequivocal. New Mexicans can't wait any longer for us to address the mounting challenges posed by extended droughts and water shortages, more destructive wildfires, and carbon pollution. The transition to a cleaner economy also represents perhaps our greatest opportunity to attract billions of dollars in new private capital, spur long-term, sustainable economic growth, and create thousands of good-paying jobs all across New Mexico. 
That's why I am so excited to see that President Joe Biden is putting climate front and center in his new administration. This week, the president signed a series of bold executive actions that will prioritize climate action in both foreign and domestic policy. The United States will finally return to making decisions based on the best science and start taking the steps necessary to accelerate our transition toward a clean energy future. That means putting millions of Americans back to work, including national service workers in a new Civilian Climate Corps. By rejoining the Paris Climate Accord, President Biden is also showing the whole world that America is serious about protecting the future of our planet. 
I fully recognize that confronting this crisis and transforming our economy will not come without challenges. We must do right by all of the New Mexico fossil fuel workers who have long powered our nation and the communities who have borne the brunt of pollution. We must also work diligently to offset impacts to state budgets. I will hold the Biden administration accountable for following through on its promises to ensure an equitable transition and substantial economic investments in traditional energy communities. 
With the right policy decisions and the right infrastructure in place, New Mexico can lead the world in climate action and remain a global leader in producing and exporting energy.
Sincerely,
￼

Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 1.29.21
Friday. January 29, 2021 –                                 
Leading Oversight Efforts on the Energy and Commerce Committee
Throughout my time in the U.S. House of Representatives, I have been honored to serve on the Energy and Commerce Committee. It is the oldest standing legislative committee in the House with broad jurisdiction over domestic policy issues including health, energy, environment, telecommunications, and more.
Many of these issues have a direct impact on the lives of constituents in Virginia’s Ninth Congressional District. My position on Energy and Commerce allows me to advocate for our region’s priorities and needs.
For the new Congress, I have been named Republican Leader of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations by Energy and Commerce Committee Republican Leader Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA). I am grateful for this opportunity to serve in a leading role.
The Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations is charged with conducting oversight over areas within the committee’s jurisdiction. We investigate problems, ensure that the laws we pass are being carried out, and supervise agencies.
Although it is not tasked with writing legislation, the subcommittee carries out an essential legislative function. Its activities may lead to new laws, highlight problems with those already on the books, or prod the executive branch to better fulfill the responsibilities our laws assign them.
Throughout my time on the subcommittee, we have often acted in a bipartisan manner. Investigations such as those into the origins of the opioid crisis or into mismanagement in the federal bureaucracy impact constituents of Republican and Democrat districts.
As I work with subcommittee Chair Diana DeGette (D-CO), I am confident we can maintain this outlook going forward. We certainly won’t always agree, but many of our priorities have little to do with party affiliation. In the past, we have worked together productively on issues including compounding pharmacies and opioids. Further, we both disapprove of government bureaucrats who do not follow the law.
Our first hearing of this Congress will be on the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. State health officials from across the country will testify on their efforts to distribute the vaccines and the challenges they face.
Since the Food and Drug Administration authorized two vaccines in December, states have been receiving doses. In keeping with our federalist system of government, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services have issued guidance, but states ultimately decide how to administer their doses and who to prioritize in vaccinating.
They have performed with varying degrees of success. For example, West Virginia has led the country in administering its allocation of doses. As an unfortunate contrast, Virginia has long been near the bottom of the rankings.
It will be important to learn from these states to understand what has been done rightly or wrongly in the vaccination process so we can improve the rollout going forward.
Moving onward, I expect the subcommittee will continue its work on the opioid crisis. Earlier investigations conducted by the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations helped uncover how some small-town pharmacies, including a few in West Virginia not far from the Virginia border, ordered enormous quantities of pain pills without attracting adequate scrutiny from distributors or the Drug Enforcement Agency. As overdose deaths appear to have risen during the pandemic, examining this scourge should remain a priority.
Other issue areas, including cybersecurity and prescription drug costs, also hold out the promise of bipartisan cooperation.
One area I intend to pursue with rigor is oversight over the Biden Administration within our jurisdiction.
When I served on the subcommittee during the Obama Administration, I saw too often executive branch officials and agencies overstep their bounds or flout the will of Congress in pursuit of a wrongheaded and harmful agenda. Considering that President Biden has signaled the same approach on many issues and even filled his administration with many of the same people, I anticipate that the subcommittee will have plenty to do. This may not be as bipartisan as other topics, but it is no less essential.
I am honored to take on this leadership role on the Energy and Commerce Committee. It will be a meaningful platform to further advance the priorities of the Ninth District in the House of Representatives.
If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office.  You can call my Abingdon office at 276-525-1405 or my Christiansburg office at 540-381-5671. To reach my office via email, please visit my website at www.morgangriffith.house.gov.

Business Brief: Paycheck Protection Program Reopened for Small Businesses
 
 
The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) reopened so small businesses hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic can apply for additional financial relief. On Monday, January 11, the PPP opened for small, community-based lenders to issue PPP loans to small businesses that did not receive a PPP loan during the first round.

As of Wednesday, January 13, the PPP reopened for small businesses to apply for a second round of relief. Eligible businesses are those that have exhausted their first PPP loan, have 300 or fewer employees, and have experienced at least 25% revenue loss.

Committee on House Administration Ranking Member Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) welcomes Republican members, U.S. Reps. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.) and Bryan Steil (R-Wisc.), to the committee for the 117th Congress.

“Even though its role is not well known outside of Washington, DC, the Committee on House Administration plays a vital role in several issues that are currently on the forefront of Americans’ concerns. With jurisdiction over federal election law, to oversight of Capitol Police, the importance of the Committee on House Administration is extremely vital,” said Loudermilk. “I am honored to be a part of this important committee in the 117th Congress. I look forward to working with Ranking Member Davis, Rep. Bryan Steil, and my colleagues across the aisle, on big issues like securing our elections and supporting our Capitol Hill Police, so they are better prepared and equipped to safely guard our nation’s capital.”

Dear Friend,

This past week I’ve been working in the district. During my time at home I’ve been reflecting on how grateful I am to serve our district – and how excited I am for the term ahead. This week was filled with a lot of updates, like getting my district office up and running and receiving my committee assignments. I am looking forward to getting back to DC to start working on my new committees. 

I’ll be using this newsletter as a way to keep you up to date on my work on behalf of our Orange County community, so make sure you sign up for regular updates. You can also connect with my official Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages, where I’ll be posting the latest news and updates.

My Huntington Beach office officially opened this week and is ready to serve you. The mission of my district office is to serve our community, and be fully accessible even when I’m in Washington, D.C. My staff here are also well equipped to process casework requests – so if you’re having difficulties with the IRS or another Federal Agency, this office is the best place for you to contact. I am looking forward to welcoming constituents from across the district into this office. Contact us here.

This week I received my committee assignments for the 117th Congress. I will be serving on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure as well as the Committee on Education and Labor. These assignments will allow me to work on important issues for our Orange County community, like protecting our coastline, reducing noise pollution, advancing school choice, and expanding workforce development. These new assignments are a great opportunity to support Orange County families and workers, and I won’t let you down.  

I joined my congressional colleagues in a letter to Allison Herren Lee, Acting Chairwoman of the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC), seeking answers into the anti-competitive practices and consumer trading restrictions seen this week by hedge funds and financial trading apps following the surge of stocks like GameStop ($GME). Earlier this week, investors – through trading apps such as Robinhood – bought shares in companies including GameStop, following publicly available news that investors had been short selling the stocks. The stock prices surged, and following pressure from Wall Street, the apps froze the traders’ ability to continue buying on the platform. Read the letter here. 

COVID-19 Updates 

Vaccines
I’ve received many calls from constituents over the past week with concerns about the vaccination process in Orange County. Per state guidelines, Orange County is taking a phased approach to vaccine distribution and aiming to reach the most vulnerable populations first. If you are a healthcare worker, 65 and older, or a law enforcement officer working in a high-risk setting, you can make an appointment here. 

If you are not in one of these categories, vaccines are not yet available in Orange County. The county is coordinating at the state and federal levels to get vaccines distributed as efficiently as possible to all who want one. It is important to continue taking proper COVID-19 safety precautions. For more information on vaccine distribution in Orange County, click here.  

Small Businesses 
The U.S. Small Business Administration, in consultation with the U.S. Treasury Department has reopened the Paycheck Protection Program loan portal for first- and second-time borrowers. If you’re a small business owner, check out the SBA’s website for the most up to date resources and guidance.

Economic Impact Payments 
The Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 includes a second round of Economic Impact Payments for qualified individuals making up to $75,000 per year. 

The second round of payments, or “EIP 2,” is generally $600 for singles and $1,200 for married couples filing a joint return. Most of these payments will be made by direct deposit. For those who are eligible for a second EIP and haven’t yet received a direct deposit, watch your mail for either a paper check or a debit card.

Dear Friend,
We’ve reached an important time in our battle against COVID-19 as vaccine distribution begins to pick up pace.
As a scientist, I am happy to report that the news about the performance of all of the approved vaccines has been excellent. Tens of millions of doses of vaccine have been given to people of all ethnicities with no significant safety problems. And although none of the vaccines are 100 percent effective at preventing COVID-19, they do appear to prevent severe COVID-19, and to virtually eliminate the need for hospitalization even if you do get COVID-19. So as a 65-year old Member of Congress, I took my vaccination as soon as it was available, and you should too!
The State of Illinois has entered Phase 1B of its COVID-19 vaccination effort. This means Illinoisans age 65 and older, as well as frontline essential workers can now register to receive the vaccine. This group includes first responders, educators, food and agriculture workers, manufacturers, corrections workers and inmates, USPS workers, public transit workers, grocery store workers, and staff at shelters and day cares. Click here to learn more about the State of Illinois’ vaccine plan.
County health departments are responsible for distributing vaccines as they become available. Each county has a slightly different process, with some counties using sign up forms and others using email notification systems. Visit your county’s health department website to learn more. Counties located in IL-11 are listed with the appropriate link to the vaccine distribution information here:
	•	Cook County
	•	DuPage County
	•	Kane County
	•	Kendall County
	•	Will County
 The U.S. vaccine safety system is designed to ensure that all vaccines are as safe as possible. The COVID-19 vaccines that have received emergency use authorization have gone through rigorous clinical trials and are monitored through existing and expanded safety monitoring systems. Please visit the Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s website for more information.  Expanding vaccine deployment is a significant step forward in our fight against COVID-19 and I urge everyone to get vaccinated as soon as it's available to them.  Phase 1B includes 3.2 million adults in Illinois, and public health experts estimate it will take three months to fully vaccinate this group. Please be patient as vaccines are deployed.  While vaccines are being distributed, please continue to follow the recommendations of doctors and public health experts:
	•	Wear a mask in public
	•	Practice social distancing as much as possible
	•	Avoid crowds and large gatherings
	•	Stay home and call your doctor if you're feeling sick
 It will be important to continue to follow these steps as vaccines are being rolled out.  We all need to work together and put the health of our families and our communities first.  For more information and to get your questions answered on COVID-19 vaccines and distribution in the 11th District, please join me and the following panel of community leaders and health experts on Facebook live on Thursday, February 4 at 6 p.m.
￼
I look forward to answering your questions on February 4.
While my offices in Illinois and Washington D.C. will remain closed to the public for now, my staff continues to work in a virtual capacity and is available to assist you if you need help. Please call my D.C. office at 202-225-3515, or my Aurora office at 630-585-7672 and leave a message.
As always, visit coronavirus.illinois.gov for the most up-to-date information regarding Illinois' COVID-19 efforts and vaccine distribution updates.  The safety of you and your loved ones is of the utmost importance. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to call my office at (202) 225-3515.  Remember, I am here to work for you. If you have any questions, or concerns please feel free to e-mail me, call our office, or connect with me on Facebook and Twitter.

1/29/21 16:37,Senator Murphy COVID-19 Weekly Update: January 29th,"￼
Friend – 
Below please find the Murphy office update on COVID-19. 
As always, if you need assistance, please don’t hesitate to contact our Hartford or Washington, D.C. offices. 
Here’s what you need to know this week:  
	•	This week, Senator Murphy introduced legislation with Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire to reverse a damaging rule change made by the Trump administration that increased out-of-pocket costs for millions of Americans and made fewer Americans eligible for the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) premium tax credits, while also causing those who are eligible to receive less in tax credit support. 
	•	Senator Murphy also introduced legislation to study and address how social, environmental, and economic conditions exacerbate health inequities for Black, Brown, Indigenous, and people of color. These conditions, known as social determinants of health (SDOH), are the result of institutional racism embedded in our society including in housing, employment, education, health care and more.
	•	As President Biden signed an Executive Order to strengthen opportunities to Buy America this week, Murphy also announced his plans to reintroduce his legislation that will create jobs across Connecticut and the United States, and support U.S. manufacturers when competing for federal contracts against foreign companies.
	•	Senator Murphy visited Backus Hospital in Norwich to see their vaccine clinic and distribution program. He also thanked health care workers and staff, encouraged people to get vaccinated when the vaccine becomes available to them, and reminded people to continue to get tested for COVID-19 and follow public health guidance.
	•	Senator Murphy was joined by Senator Richard Blumenthal, Connecticut Speaker of the House of Representatives Matt Ritter and Hartford Mayor Luke Bronin at a press conference in Hartford calling on the U.S. Congress to substantially increase state and local aid in the next COVID-19 relief bill, which will soon be debated in Washington.
	•	This week, President Joe Biden announced plans to re-open enrollment for the federal Health Insurance Marketplace, and took additional steps to strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, and protect women’s health.
	•	This week, Governor Ned Lamont directed the Connecticut Department of Public Health to continue vaccinations for the 1.4 million individuals included in Phase 1b of Connecticut’s COVID-19 vaccine rollout using a tiered approach based on risk of adverse health outcomes from the virus. The State anticipates receiving about 45,000 doses of vaccine per week from the federal government.
	•	Last week, the Connecticut Department of Social Services announced that food benefits will increase by 15% for all Connecticut households enrolled in SNAP. Approximately 110,000 enrollees will receive monthly COVID-19 emergency benefits starting on Saturday.  
For information on federal coronavirus relief, including help for small businesses, direct cash payments and more, visit murphy.senate.gov/coronavirus. This page provides answers to frequently asked questions and gives a summary of available programs and funding. 
For the latest information about keeping you or your family safe go to cdc.gov/coronavirus. For resources and information about Connecticut’s response, including updates about vaccine distribution, visit ct.gov/coronavirus. 
I hope you found this letter helpful. You can get the latest updates on Senator Murphy’s work in the Senate by following him on Facebook and Instagram. If you have questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to our offices in Hartford or in Washington, DC.

1/29/21 16:14,Every American should have the chance to vote like an Oregonian - at home,"￼ 
Dear Lindsey,
Our democracy is stronger when every American can vote, without having to stand in ridiculous lines or take time off work or school to exercise their Constitutional rights. To get the big things done that really improve Americans' lives, our country needs the government to represent all Americans. Oregonians know that voting at home is a time-tested, secure and accessible way to vote. It's high time the rest of the country had the chance to vote the way we do. 

I'm working to do just that. This week I introduced the Vote at Home Act to implement sweeping election reforms and make it easier for Americans to vote. My bill will: 
	•	Promote the Ability of Voters to Vote by Mail - All registered voters would receive ballots in the mail weeks before Election Day, allowing them to carefully research candidates and issues well ahead of Election Day to inform their vote.
	•	Expand Options for Casting Ballots - All registered voters would have the ability to cast their ballot through the mail or a drop-off site. 
	•	Fund the United States Postal Service - The legislation would cover costs for USPS associated with mailing ballots both to and from voters in federal elections, including the cost of postage for every voter.  
	•	Automatic Voter Registration - States would be required to ensure that each citizen who provides identifying information to the state motor vehicle authority is automatically registered to vote. 

While 30 states adopted or changed their laws for the 2020 general election, allowing voters to cast their ballots from home in order to protect public health, it shouldn't take a world-wide pandemic to realize the value of expanding access to the ballot box. And expanding access to the ballot is even more critical now as Republicans in state legislatures are pressing to restrict voters with nonsense, bad-faith policies. 

Oregon has shown voting by mail works - no matter your political preferences. It can work for the rest of America, too.

Life Unites
This past week, we marked the anniversary of a deadly day in American history that has resulted in the loss of millions of innocent American lives: the anniversary of Roe v. Wade.  Since January, 22 1973, more than 60 million unborn children have been lost to the scourge of abortion.  Today, we honor and remember those lives, as well as those who have been hurt by the pains of abortion.  In a normal year, tens of thousands of Americans would be marching down Constitution Avenue this Friday to do so. This year, as with so many things, the March for Life will instead be virtual.  But nonetheless, Americans will continue to march – whether virtually, or in person where they can.  The theme of this year’s March is “Together Strong: Life Unites.”  A fitting theme following a year rife with division, violence, and loss. Now more than ever, we must unite as a nation, turning with hope towards the future.  Hope that our nation will heal.  Hope that justice will prevail.  Hope that the grievous act of abortion will be forsaken.  And, given our country’s history – in which we have stubbornly made mistakes, but thankfully, come around in the end – there is much reason for hope.  But we cannot heal and unite if we do not honor and respect all of the American people – born, and unborn.  Through our laws and with our lives, we ought to affirm the truth that the lives of both the mother and the baby matter…. and that healthcare should heal, protect, and preserve both those lives.  That is why I introduced legislation this week to help our laws and taxpayer dollars affirm that truth.  Through my bill, the Abortion is Not Healthcare Act, we have the chance to stop the tax deductibility of abortions, which are currently categorized as “medical care” by the IRS.  Because we must be serious: whatever else it may be, of course elective abortion is not health care. That’s why physicians literally take an oath “to do no harm.”  The government should not offer tax benefits for a procedure that kills hundreds of thousands of unborn children each year.  And we also have the chance to permanently stop the use of American foreign aid money from funding or promoting abortions overseas; perpetuating violence against women and children abroad – especially, baby girls.  The Protecting Life in Foreign Assistance Act will save countless lives across the globe, and affirms the truth that the lives of all unborn children – regardless of where they are from – have dignity and worth.  As the lyrics of a children’s song in my church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, say about each one of us, “I am a child of God.”   We are one human family, all children of God… these littlest among us, too, who cannot yet sing for themselves. But they will soon. They will soon.

1/29/21 15:15,State of the Sixth Address,"Updates from Chrissy!
￼ 
  Dear Lindsey, 
The Commonwealth we call home is where this wonderful democratic experiment, the United States, began. Our very own Benjamin Franklin issued a now historic and oft-repeated warning – we have a republic, if we can keep it.
For me, there is no if. There is only a must.
Our democracy endures because we profoundly believe in the tenets that bind us together not only as a nation, but also as a citizenry.
I just presented our second annual State of the Sixth address to our community. As your elected member in Congress, I am so grateful to share with you the work that we are accomplishing on behalf of the people of the Pennsylvania Sixth and to continue the discussion about our democracy. 

In This E-Newsletter You Will Find:  Recent/Upcoming Events — Including last night's State of the Sixth and next week's dial-in town hall focusing on vaccine distribution here in our community.  What We're Working On —  Including bipartisan legislation I introduced yesterday that will help create jobs and foster the entrepreneurial spirit our country needs at this critical time.  Delivering For Our Community — Including the total number of constituents we helped during my first term in Congress and a recent example of casework where we assisted John in Coatesville resolve his problem with the USPS. 
 .  .  .

Recent/Upcoming Events
State of the Sixth and Virtual Swearing-In Ceremony
￼

A few weeks ago in Washington, I had the privilege of taking the oath of office again on behalf of our community and country. As you can imagine, it was a very different experience with COVID than it was a couple of years ago. We were called in shifts, and I took my oath in the back corner of the House Floor (referred to as 'Pennsylvania Corner') largely on my own. It was a chance to reflect quietly and contemplatively on the words of this sacrosanct oath. We thought that it might be good to breathe those words to life again with you all who were not able to join me in DC.

I am very thankful to Judge Analisa Sondergaard, Court of the Common Pleas of Chester County, who led me in my virtual oath of office, which you can watch here.

￼

Reflecting on my first term in office, one of our early goals was leading with a new level of transparency, accessibility and accountability. To that end, we committed to holding at least one town hall per month, and we have more than met that goal. In fact, we hosted more in-person and virtual town halls than any other member of the Pennsylvania delegation.
In recognition of the efforts of our team, the Congressional Management Foundation awarded our office the Democracy Award for Transparency and Accountability. Only two awards in this category are awarded each year, and they are awarded bi-partisanally and bi-camerally. Our office is the first freshman office to receive this recognition. 
￼

For those of you who attended last night's address, these slides should look familiar! Now, I know many of us can't see the details, but I just wanted to give you a visual of the many topics we covered. I talked about the importance of engaging with constituents in new and creative ways, the inspiration I've drawn from our community as essential workers continue to serve us, our voter participation initiative, and our efforts to promote our agricultural economy.

Regarding our COVID-19 response, I outlined our fight for local small businesses that have been so gravely affected by this pandemic. I serve on the Small Business Committee because I know that the businesses of Main Street are the backbone of our economy. I also detailed our office's actions to support educators and students through additional funding, address the affordable housing and eviction crisis too many families are facing, and host necessary conversations about equity and equality in our nation.

If you have the time, you can see all of these slides (at normal size!) and watch the entirety of my live presentation at this link.
Next Week: Community Town Hall to Discuss Covid Vaccine Distribution
Our office has been getting many questions about vaccine distribution. To address those questions, we are hosting a Vaccine Telephone Town Hall next Wednesday, February 3 at 6:00PM. To participate, please dial (855) 731-4616. Vaccines are one of the most effective tools we have to contain this virus. I encourage all Pennsylvanians to get the vaccine when it is made available to you. In Congress, I’m working to secure aid for states and localities so that they can more quickly distribute vaccines. 

But even with the vaccine, we must continue to practice social distancing and wear masks to most effectively and efficiently contain and beat this virus. Below is some information about the current state of vaccine distribution in our Commonwealth: 

	•	Pennsylvania is currently in group 1A of the vaccination phase. This includes health care workers, residents of long-term care facilities, persons ages 16-64 with high-risk conditions, and folks 65 and older. An exhaustive list of those who fit under 1A can be found on PA’s vaccine site. 
	•	Those that wish to be vaccinated can pre-register for vaccination on the Chester County vaccination site. Anyone who works or resides in Chester County may pre-register even if they don’t meet the current group criteria. Once you pre-register, you will receive notifications as appointments become available for COVID-19 vaccine. This will also keep folks updated on the current group phase. 
	•	Constituents living in Berks County can visit the Berks vaccine site to find vaccine providers within the county. 
	•	Please contact the PA Dept. of Health if you do not have access to a computer or smartphone at 1-877-724-3258 for more information on scheduling a vaccine appointment. Only folks who fit under the 1A group are being vaccinated at this time, therefore they are the only ones who can schedule vaccination appointments.
What We're Working On
Helping Create Jobs and Foster the Entrepreneurial Spirit
￼

As a former engineer and entrepreneur, I know the problems our small businesses and entrepreneurs face in normal times and that those problems have multiplied tenfold during this pandemic. We need to be doing everything in our capacity to support our talented entrepreneurs in translating their innovative ideas into marketable products and cutting-edge technology – too many endeavors fail because they lack access to capital or face IP protection challenges. 

Pennsylvania is home to a number of successful startups, which began with an idea and have turned into small businesses, creating jobs on Main Street and products Americans use every day. I’m proud to work with Representative Balderson on this bipartisan legislation that will help jumpstart job creation and support our entrepreneurs and small business owners. We cannot wait.
Backing President Biden's American Rescue Plan

￼

Just a couple weeks ago, I represented our community at President Biden and Vice President Harris' Inauguration. We are in the early days of this new Administration and new Congress and there is so much work to be done. First and foremost, we must work together to crush this virus.
My top priority is continuing to provide relief to our community during this pandemic. I'm supporting additional funds and aid for vaccine distribution, fighting for our small businesses so they can weather this crisis, rebuilding our economy in a way that creates opportunities for everyone, regardless of skill level, and creating jobs that pay a living wage in Chester and Berks counties. We must work to rebuild a more inclusive economy and that includes a robust infrastructure package.
ICYMI: Our Valentines for Veterans Project

￼

Many of you have already seen our Valentines for Veterans initiative. In fact, we've already received our first card, pictured above! We are inviting students and residents in the region to participate in the Valentines for Veterans project by making (or buying if you unable to craft yourself!) cards for area veterans to thank them for their service. Remember, the cards will be delivered in the days before Valentine's Day to veteran neighbors. Those who wish to participate may drop off or mail cards to our West Chester office during normal business hours between now and Friday, February 12. Call (610) 883-5050 with any questions.
 
Delivering for Our Community: Constituent Services

As I mentioned during last night's address, our office has closed nearly 2,000 constituent cases to date, and we stand ready to continue serving our community. Especially during this pandemic, we understand that many of our neighbors are navigating difficult situations with the IRS, Social Security Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, and others. Let me be very clear; we are here to help. Here's what John from Coatesville had to say about our constituent services:

1/29/21 15:11,Bacon Brief: Keystone XL Pipeline Vital to Nebraska and U.S.,"￼
January 29, 2021
 
 
Keystone XL Pipeline Vital to Nebraska and U.S.
 
 
Dear friend, 
 
During his first week in office, President Biden signed 17 executive orders. One of them was to cancel the Keystone XL Pipeline and demand agencies to review and reverse more than 100 pro-climate actions enforced by the previous administration, in order to “save the environment.” However, this executive order doesn’t do any of that and has upset many Americans, unions, and energy groups.
 
Pipelines are the safest, most environmental-friendly way to transport energy. By canceling the Keystone XL Pipeline, Biden’s Administration is now responsible for neglecting our nation’s most important environmental issues, destroying thousands of construction and union jobs, and hurting our relationship with one of our top North American trade partners, Canada. Let’s talk about each one of these. 
 
1. Hurts America’s energy sector
 
For 10 years, sections of the Keystone XL pipeline have been vital to our nation’s energy sector by transporting nearly 183,000 barrels of tar sands oil per day from Alberta, Canada to refineries on the Gulf Coast of Texas. Some studies say that the full capacity of oil carried by the pipeline is going to reach the market regardless of whether the pipeline is cancelled or not due to global demand. If the pipeline is cancelled, all of the products will be delivered by rail or truck.
 
The Keystone XL pipeline is a carbon net zero project, and under President Trump’s Administration, we’ve cut carbon emissions more than the next 12 countries combined. Under President Biden, gas prices have already increased by nearly 15 cents and will continue to skyrocket. As a member of the Climate Solutions Caucus, I believe in policies that lower gas prices, increase investment in renewable power and energy storage, promote the enhancement of the ethanol and biofuels industry, all while ensuring energy jobs are secured. The Keystone Pipeline makes all of these a reality and significantly lowers our carbon footprint. 
 
2. Kills thousands of American jobs
 
The pipeline supports nearly 60,000 well-paid direct and indirect employment opportunities, including tens of thousands union jobs. The cancellation delivered a punch to the gut of approximately 11,000 Nebraskans who would have been working on it. Because of our state’s extreme climate, Nebraska is one of the top 10 states in energy consumption per capita. For the average American family, energy costs will go up and local communities will suffer. Thousands of Americans are already unemployed because of COVID. Why would the President purposely put Americans out of work with nothing final in place to find employment for them?
 
3. Ruins our relationship with Canada
 
The Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, said this action made by President Biden was disappointing. Canada is the United States’ leading energy supplier, and this pipeline project is our biggest bilateral trade agreement. We rely on Canadian energy, and this action is disrespectful to our North American partner. This is a decision that should’ve been thoroughly discussed and assessed between President Biden and Prime Minister Trudeau, rather than recklessly revoking the pipeline project. 
 
Alberta Premier, Jason Kenney, even went on Fox News to discuss pushback on Biden’s executive order and argued the pipeline reduces risk and helps our country remain energy independent by rejecting energy dependence on foreign oil from countries like Russia and those affiliated with OPEC.
 
This pipeline directly travels through Nebraska and affects our state’s economy, energy sector, and the livelihoods of so many. I urge President Biden to repeal his decision and support projects that reduce our country’s carbon footprint, create jobs, and strengthen our friendship through trade agreements with our North American ally.
 
If you have any questions or concerns, please call my office at (402) 938-0300 or visit my Congressional website at https://bacon.house.gov.
 
Sincerely, 
Don

A Trillion Here and a Trillion There

Last week I wrote about Missouri’s COVID-19 vaccine distribution and administration effort. Before I get into this week’s ‘Long’s Short Report’, I want to address some concerning news that people have been hearing regarding vaccination efforts. There have been reports that the state is falling short in its effort to administer the vaccine. As Governor Parson stated, national rankings on the CDC's dashboard are marginal and are being used to misinform Missourians that the state is falling short in vaccine administration. The most up to date data and information on Missouri’s vaccine distribution efforts can be found at https://covidvaccine.mo.gov/data/. I would encourage you to visit the dashboard and explore the website to learn more about the state’s vaccine distribution plan, when you are eligible to receive a vaccine, and where to find vaccinators in your area.
To paraphrase a quote attributed to the late Sen. Everett Dirksen ‘A trillion here and a trillion there and pretty soon you’re talking about real money!’ Just over a month ago, Congress passed a $900 billion phase 4 COVID-19 relief package to provide critical relief to the American people. Before these funds have even been expended, President Biden is proposing a massive $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package. While there are items in this proposal that I would agree with and would be happy to work with the President on, there are some things that are extremely concerning. 
When the CARES Act was first passed, it included a provision to supplement unemployment benefits with an additional $600 per week. This was critical in the outset of this pandemic as many businesses were forced to close their doors through no fault of their own. During this time, I heard from many concerned small business owners that their businesses were opening again but their employees were not coming back to work because they were getting paid more to stay home. This is worrisome because Washington should be encouraging people to get back to work, not to stay home. That is why Democrats and Republicans agreed to lower the supplemental benefit to $300 weekly. The Biden plan increases that benefit, ultimately encouraging many Americans to stay home and collect unemployment rather than return to work. This not only hurts small businesses that are trying to get on their feet again, but it hurts the economy by causing millions of people to file unemployment claims rather than return to work.
Another damaging provision in President Biden’s package is an increase in the minimum wage. This would be an increased cost on small businesses at a bad time and would cause some restaurants to increase their wages by 700%. The fact of the matter is the cost of living throughout the United States varies greatly and the minimum wage should reflect that. Raising the minimum wage in Chicago to $15 may not have as detrimental of an impact on small businesses there, but raising it to $15 in southwest Missouri where the cost of living is significantly lower will be devastating to many small businesses and could force many who are barely hanging on through this pandemic to close their doors permanently. A MO-7 constituent recently told me he’d love to pay $15 an hour to his employees but in order to find qualified reliable help, he currently pays $22 an hour and still has problems running full crews. You see, I believe supply and demand should dictate wage levels, not arbitrary edicts being handed down by those in their ivory towers in the nation’s capital.
While these and other economic provisions in President Biden’s plan are troubling, there are areas where we can work in a bipartisan fashion. Specifically, his provisions relating to health. Increased funding for vaccine distribution is critical to ensuring states can continue to vaccinate at their current rates. Additionally, his plan would provide more funding for personal protective equipment (PPE), and expand testing even further. These health provisions are something Republicans and Democrats can agree on and I believe that there is plenty of room to work out an agreement on provisions like these.
Another positive coming from President Biden’s package is that it finally gets Democrats on board with reopening schools. For months, Republicans have been urging Democrats on the federal and state level to work to reopen schools, but our pleas fell on deaf ears. President Biden’s plan includes funding that schools can use to reopen and has finally brought Democrats on board with the prospect of getting kids back to school in a safe and responsible manner.
The $1.9 trillion price tag on President Biden’s relief package is extremely hefty and many aspects have been covered in previous relief packages that do not need to be included in this plan. President Biden’s plan can serve as a good starting point for a great bipartisan package, but all indications show that President Biden and Congressional Democrats plan to cut Republicans out of the process completely by forcing this package through with budget reconciliation, an expedited process that limits debate. The economic provisions in this package are certainly troubling, and while these provisions would benefit urban America, they will greatly damage rural America. There is plenty here that Republicans and Democrats can work together on, and I hope President Biden proves that he is the unifier he says he will be by including Republicans in the process and not leaving rural America behind with this relief package.

I'm Proud to be Pro-Life
 
 
My wife Cathy and I are parents only because of two women who chose life, and we know first-hand how impactful and important that decision is. That’s why I’m proud to fight for the sanctity of life and the rights of the unborn by supporting pro-life and pro-family legislation in Congress.  
 
WATCH: House Republicans proudly stand for life 
 
￼
 
Unfortunately, last Congress, Democrats blocked over 80 attempts by House Republicans to force a vote to protect babies born-alive and end infanticide. And now, they’re fighting to remove the Hyde Amendment, a popular protection against taxpayer-funded abortions that has had strong bipartisan support in Congress for the past four decades. Since the Hyde Amendment was enacted, over 2 million babies’ lives have been saved. I believe that protecting lives is not a partisan issue, and that taxpayers should not be forced to pay for abortions.
 
WATCH: House Republicans are united to #SaveHyde
 
￼
 
We know that if given the chance, the new administration and Democrats in Congress will ignore the importance of defending life, and take steps to allow for taxpayer-funded abortions. House Republicans will not let that happen –  and I remain committed to fighting for the unborn and standing for life.

1/29/21 14:41,We Must Unite Our Country,"￼
A Week in the Great Eight
We Must Unite Our Country
Dear Friend, 
This is my first newsletter of the new year, so I want to begin by commenting on the violent riots that took place in the halls of the United States Capitol earlier this month. Like all of you, I am shocked and dismayed by this clear breakdown of our republic. This is not who we are as a nation. We are a nation of laws, and I hope everyone who broke the law on January 6th is prosecuted. 
As Americans, we may have political differences, but violence must never be normalized or tolerated. Our fundamental right to peacefully assemble and protest is one that I fully support; yet I fully condemn this violence and criminal behavior - just as I condemned the mob violence that took place in cities like Minneapolis, Seattle and Kenosha this past summer.
What happened in the Capitol on January 6th is a blatant sign that tensions are running high and that the rhetoric on both sides needs to be checked. It is imperative that leaders and Americans across this nation take this opportunity to unite our country. I assure you all that I plan on taking part in this healing process, which is why I attended the Inauguration last week to witness the peaceful transfer of power. 
￼
Was glad to attend the Presidential Inauguration with 
my friend Jason George, who serves as the business 
manager of the International Union of Operating 
Engineers Local 49.
President Biden's Agenda Contradicts Unity
While I appreciated President Biden’s message of unity during his Inaugural address, I believe much of what has been done during the first week of his Administration has not matched his rhetoric.
Instead of working with leaders on both sides of the aisle to get our country through this economic crisis, President Biden’s first move in office was to kill the Keystone XL Pipeline, a critical energy infrastructure project. The result of this action was the loss of thousands of American union jobs and the decline of American energy independence.
Rather than putting America’s workers first, President Biden rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement, a move that will transfer millions of good-paying jobs from America to bad actors, like China, who have little obligation to reduce their continually growing carbon emissions under this agreement.
And instead of promoting policies that lower the cost of healthcare, President Biden has frozen the Trump Administration’s policy requiring community health centers to pass on all their insulin discount savings to patients. Lowering insulin costs must not be a partisan issue and I hope the President will reconsider.
While the first week of the Biden Administration has been largely unsuccessful, it doesn’t need to be this way. There are many issues that both Republicans and Democrats agree upon, and I believe that good bipartisan work can be accomplished on a variety of issues, ranging from expanding rural broadband to lowering the cost of prescription drugs.
President Biden and Democrat leaders in Congress have an opportunity to live up to the pledge of unity that was made in President Biden’s Inaugural address last week, and I hope they rise to the challenge. However, I am also concerned that the main item on Congressional Democrats’ agenda has been impeaching former President Trump. These efforts are a waste of time and will only further divide an already divided nation. In the House, I voted against impeaching Donald Trump.
No matter what Democrat leaders choose to do, I promise to stay the course and work on the issues that matter most to Minnesotans and defend our way of life.
Saving America’s Mines 
I recently introduced my first bill of the 117th Congress, the Saving America’s Mines Act. This legislation will prohibit any Administration from unilaterally halting the mining of critical minerals on federal lands where mining is currently permissible.
I introduced this legislation with President Joe Biden and his Administration specifically in mind, as a politically motivated mineral withdrawal in the Superior National Forest occurred in the final days of his Vice Presidency. And because of President Biden’s anti-jobs actions during his first week in office, I am especially fearful that he will follow in Obama’s footsteps on the mining issue and unilaterally eliminate more good-paying jobs right here in the Northland.
Thousands of jobs should not be eliminated on the whim of one politician or the unelected bureaucrats in his Administration. If our nation is to truly move forward and prosper, the Obama-era attacks on mining must remain a thing of the past. Americans need the critical minerals that exist on our lands for infrastructure, modern energy technology, national defense, and for applications in our everyday life like cell phones, refrigerators, and batteries.
Instead of relying on China and other hostile nations for these critical resources, we should be mining them here in Minnesota because we have the strongest labor and environmental standards in the world. I am proud that the first bill I introduced this Congress will save mining jobs and defend our way of life. 
My Continued Commitment to Defending the Unborn
Defending our way of life also means standing up for life. This month is the 48th anniversary of the tragic Roe v. Wade decision, which is why I was proud to come together with so many Minnesotans at the Brainerd March for Life last Friday and publicly call for life to be protected at every stage.

It was inspiring to see so many Minnesotans turn out, despite
freezing temperatures.

As a father of four, a foster parent, and a Member of Congress, I will continue to fight for the rights of the unborn. In fact, this week, I helped introduce legislation to make it illegal for a doctor to knowingly perform an abortion being sought because a baby has or may have Down syndrome. This legislation holds a special place in my heart because my son Isaac has Down syndrome.
I also joined 199 of my colleagues in sending a letter to Congressional leadership, requesting they oppose any efforts by Democrats to weaken the Hyde Amendment, a forty-year old law that bans taxpayer funded abortions. The American people should never be forced to subsidize abortion and any attempt to force them to do so is unconscionable. 
Every child deserves the right to enjoy the many beautiful moments life has to offer. You all have my word that I will continue to fight with every fiber of my being to defend the lives of the unborn.
Month in Review 
As always, I am incredibly grateful for those who take the time to meet with myself and my staff. See a few more highlights from these past few weeks below. 
￼
I am incredibly thankful for heroic work done by the Capitol 
Police each and every day. After the violence that took place 
earlier this month, I was proud to hang up signs made by some
of my constituents in the tunnels of Capitol to show appreciation
and support from Minnesota’s Eighth District!

￼
I recently visited Birchwood Charhouse and Bar in Hackensack
on the first day customers could dine indoors again to have a
great meal. I also visited with the owners, Linda and Rick, to 
discuss how the Governor’s shutdown impacted their business
and others.

￼
I had the chance to enjoy some time on Leech Lake and  tour the fish house at Trapper's Landing. Ice fishing is a way of life for many families here in Northern Minnesota and I  wish everyone a safe and successful ice fishing season!

￼
I’m proud that so many members of the Minnesota National 
Guard protected our Capitol and helped ensure a peaceful 
transfer of power. They represented Minnesota honorably and
I’m glad I could personally thank all these heroes for their 
unwavering commitment to our nation.

￼
Glad to have visited the newly remodeled Pine
College in Pine City with President Joe Mulford.
It was incredible to see the progress made on 
this project since they broke ground in the fall
of 2019.

￼
I also joined the Teamsters Local 120 in St Paul Park to 
support worker safety. I'm proud to stand with the American
worker and their right to organize.
Once again, I appreciate you staying up to date with the work I am doing for Minnesota’s Eighth District. It is an honor to represent you in Congress. For more information, visit my website, Facebook, and Twitter pages.
Sincerely,
Congressman Pete Stauber

PRESS RELEASE

Espaillat: Candace.Person@mail.house.gov Beyer: Aaron.Fritschner@mail.house.gov Bonamici: Natalie.Crofts@mail.house.gov Garcia: Fabiola.RodriguezCiampoli@mail.house.gov Jayapal: Chris.Evans@mail.house.gov

REP. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT LEADS DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS TO INTRODUCE IMMIGRATION PACKAGE

Members of Congress Urge Biden Administration to Consider House Led Legislation Addressing Immigrant Rights and Comprehensive Immigration Reform


WASHINGTON, DC — Today, Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13), joined by Suzanne Bonamici (OR-01), Donald S. Beyer Jr. (VA-08), Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), and Jesús “Chuy” García (IL-04) introduced a critical legislative package to protect immigrant rights.

""My colleagues and I are re-introducing this series of bills, a legislative package that will protect immigrants, immigrant families, and uphold the promises of the American dream,"" said Congressman Adriano Espaillat. ""Simply put, this legislative package puts forth policies to correct the atrocities we witnessed during the previous administration. We urge President Biden to consider our legislative package as his administration prioritzes keeping families together and rolling out the framework on which we will build to finally realize comprehensive immigration reform once and for all.""  

“For four years immigrant families have borne the brunt of racist and nativist policies that betrayed America’s values,” said Congressman Don Beyer. “I witnessed the pain and suffering those polices caused, from tearful fathers whose children were torn away from them, to young children in my district whose mother was deported for driving with a broken tail light. I stood with community leaders who were outraged by ICE shakedowns at a hypothermia shelter in a place of worship, a violation of standing policy. This legislation would finally help restore humane immigration policies after four years of abuses and human rights violations.”

""We must remedy the terrible harm the previous administration caused to immigrants and mixed-status families, who are invaluable members of our community,"" said Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici. ""This package of legislation places needed checks on the tactics and conduct of ICE. Importantly, the legislation will expedite the reunion of children and families who were torn apart by Trump’s shameful and unjust family separation policy. I look forward to working with my colleagues to get these measures signed into law by President Biden.""

“Everyone, including immigrants in Chicago and across the country, deserves to feel safe when they go to school, see a doctor, practice their faith, or mourn the loss of loved ones. Instead, families live in constant fear of deportation. This legislative package will overturn some of Trump’s most egregious immigration enforcement tactics, including the practice of family separation,” said Congressman Jesús ""Chuy"" García. “The legislation also increases oversight of the Department of Homeland Security and holds ICE and CBP agents accountable by requiring the use of body cameras. In order to move forward, we must right our country’s past wrongs and ensure the rights of immigrants are protected.”

“As America begins a new presidential administration, we need to finally leave our country’s long xenophobic history of criminalizing immigration and separating families behind,” said Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal. “As one of only 14 naturalized citizens serving in Congress, I am proud to help introduce this legislative package as we work to reunite every family who has been cruelly torn apart, dramatically increase accountability and oversight measures, and stop ICE from terrorizing immigrants, our families, and our communities.”

The bills, which were first introduced in 2017 and 2018, seek to prevent a number of the most egregious immigration enforcement tactics witnessed during the Trump Administration and protect the rights of immigrants so no future administration can repeat these horrible actions.

One of the bills, the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act, will prohibit immigration enforcement in certain “sensitive locations” such as courthouses, schools, community centers and houses of worship, a tactic for targeting vulnerable immigrant communities that was common under the Trump Administration.

Another measure, the Reunite Every Unaccompanied Newborn Infant Toddler and Other Children Expeditiously (REUNITE) Act, would require the immediate reunification of children who were separated from their parent or legal guardian as a result of the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy.

Finally, the ICE and CBP Body Camera Accountability Act would require Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Patrol officers to wear body cameras and would make footage available for any legal proceedings.

The proposals have been endorsed by a number of leading advocacy groups outlined below:

REP. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT LIDERA A MIEMBROS DEMÓCRATAS EN INTRODUCCIÓN DE PAQUETE DE INMIGRACIÓN

Miembros del Congreso instan a la administración Biden a considerar un paquete legislativo liderado por la Cámara de Representantes que aborda los derechos de los inmigrantes y una reforma migratoria integral


WASHINGTON, DC — Hoy, el congresista Adriano Espaillat (NY-13), acompañado por Suzanne Bonamici (OR-01), Donald S. Beyer Jr. (VA-08), Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) y Jesús “Chuy” García (IL- 04), introdujo un paquete legislativo crucial para proteger los derechos de los inmigrantes.

""Mis colegas y yo estamos volviendo a introducir esta serie de proyectos de ley, un paquete legislativo que protegerá a los inmigrantes, las familias inmigrantes y mantendrá las promesas del Sueño Americano"", dijo el congresista Adriano Espaillat. ""En pocas palabras, este paquete legislativo propone políticas para corregir las atrocidades que presenciamos durante la administración anterior. Instamos al presidente Biden a que considere nuestro paquete legislativo, ya que su administración prioriza mantener unidas a las familias, y desarrollar el marco sobre el que construiremos para realizar una reforma migratoria integral de una vez por todas"".

“Durante cuatro años, las familias inmigrantes han soportado la peor parte de las políticas racistas y nativistas que traicionaron los valores estadounidenses”, dijo el congresista Don Beyer. “Yo fui testigo del dolor y sufrimiento que causaron esas políticas, desde padres llorosos cuyos hijos les fueron arrebatados, hasta niños pequeños en mi distrito cuya madre fue deportada por conducir con una luz trasera rota. Estuve con los líderes comunitarios que estaban indignados por las batidas de ICE en un refugio de hipotermia en un lugar de culto, una violación de la política vigente. Esta legislación finalmente ayudaría a restaurar las políticas de inmigración humanas después de cuatro años de abusos y violaciones de derechos humanos”.

""Debemos remediar el terrible daño que la administración anterior causó a los inmigrantes y las familias de estatus mixto, que son miembros invaluables de nuestra comunidad"", dijo la congresista Suzanne Bonamici. ""Este paquete legislativo coloca los controles necesarios sobre las tácticas y la conducta de ICE. Es importante destacar que la legislación acelerará la reunión de los niños y las familias que fueron destrozados por la vergonzosa e injusta política de separación familiar de Trump. Espero con entusiasmo trabajar con mis colegas para lograr que estas medidas se conviertan en ley por parte del presidente Biden"".

“Todos, incluidos los inmigrantes en Chicago y en todo el país, merecen sentirse seguros cuando vayan a la escuela, consulten a un médico, practiquen su fe o lamenten la pérdida de sus seres queridos. En cambio, estas familias viven con el temor constante de ser deportadas. Este paquete legislativo anulará algunas de las tácticas de control migratorio más atroces de Trump, incluida la práctica de la separación familiar”, dijo el congresista Jesús ""Chuy"" García. “La legislación también aumenta la supervisión del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional y hace rendir cuentas a los agentes de ICE y CBP al exigir el uso de cámaras corporales. Para avanzar, debemos corregir los errores pasados de nuestro país y garantizar la protección de los derechos de los inmigrantes"".

“A medida que Estados Unidos comienza una nueva administración presidencial, debemos finalmente dejar atrás la larga historia xenófoba de nuestro país de criminalizar la inmigración y separar familias”, dijo la congresista Pramila Jayapal. “Como uno de los 14 ciudadanos naturalizados que sirven en el Congreso, me enorgullece ayudar a presentar este paquete legislativo mientras trabajamos para reunificar a todas las familias que han sido cruelmente separadas, aumentar drásticamente las medidas de rendición de cuentas y supervisión y evitar que ICE aterrorice a los inmigrantes, nuestras familias y nuestras comunidades"".

Los proyectos de ley, que se presentaron por primera vez en 2017 y 2018, buscan prevenir una serie de las tácticas más atroces de aplicación de la ley de inmigración observadas durante la Administración Trump y proteger los derechos de los inmigrantes para que ninguna administración futura pueda repetir estas horribles acciones.
Uno de los proyectos de ley, la Ley de Protección de Lugares Sensibles, prohibirá la aplicación de la ley de inmigración en ciertos ""lugares sensibles"" como juzgados, escuelas, centros comunitarios y lugares de culto, una táctica dirigida a las comunidades de inmigrantes vulnerables que se volvió común bajo la Administración Trump.
Otra medida, la Ley de Reunir sin Demora a cada Niño Recién Nacido que Llegue sin Acompañante y a otros Niños (REUNITE), requeriría la reunificación inmediata de los niños que fueron separados de sus padres o tutores legales como resultado de la política de ""tolerancia cero"" de la administración.
Finalmente, la Ley de Rendición de Cuentas de ICE y CBP con el Porte de Cámaras Corporales requeriría que los agentes del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas y de la Oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza usen cámaras corporales y pongan las imágenes disponibles para cualquier procedimiento legal.
Las propuestas han sido respaldadas por varios de los principales grupos de defensa de los inmigrantes que se describen a continuación:

1/29/21 13:51,Broadband Internet Access: Getting Mississippians Connected,"￼
￼ 
￼  ￼  ￼  ￼ 

January 29, 2021
 
Dear Friend,  
Access to rural broadband is critical to the success of North Mississippi. For years, our corporate partners have been trying to reach homes with some success. In 2018, the Mississippi State Legislature provided an enormous boost to this effort when they allowed our rural electric power cooperatives to begin providing this essential service. I am proud of the strides they are making in connecting rural homes to the world. Federal resources have also played an essential role in the effort to enhance telehealth services, distance learning, and teleworking capabilities. High-speed internet is also a critical tool to attract businesses and industries to our great state. At this hour, crews are hanging fiber along numerous rural highways and back roads across Mississippi. To date, an estimated 5,000 miles of fiber have been hung by 15 Mississippi electric power associations - a great accomplishment. I will continue to look for federal resources to help our First District providers, including the Prentiss County Electric Power Association.
￼
 
Ronnie Rowland, Prentiss County Electric Power Association General Manager, said PCEPA is making great progress to connect an estimated 12,000 members. ""The significant progress being made every day is going to achieve critical goals, including enhanced telemedicine and distance learning,"" Rowland said. ""Additionally, coops are not-for-profit, which means all revenue earned will be left in the service area after loans are paid off. Ultimately, this will mean better service and more money on the tax rolls. This is a win-win for everyone.""  
 
  
 
CARES ACT - IN THE CLASSROOM
 
 
 
￼
 
Prentiss County School District Superintendent Jeff Palmer said district officials formulated a plan to meet their needs. ""We have not had to completely shut down,"" Palmer said. ""CARES Act funding enabled us to place an iPad in the hands of every student. We now have Wi-Fi hotspots to send home with many students with limited or no internet access. We were also able to hire two teachers who serve as technology coaches to help our other teachers make the best use of technology in and out of the classroom. Our schools have Wi-Fi that is accessible in the parking lots. Funding also covered digital temperature devices, handwashing stations, and sanitizing products that clean classrooms and busses more efficiently. It has been a challenging time for our schools, but we are managing well.""
 
￼
 
Devan Tate, a Prentiss County School District teacher, said he is thankful for the iPads and other tools available to teachers and students. ""So much has changed now,"" Mr. Tate said. ""Wi-Fi access is much more widespread. We are trying to get every student used to different formats. All students have internet access which is vital should the schools ever be forced to close at a moment's notice.""
 
  
 
PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM
 
 
The Small Business Administration (SBA) has reopened the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for First Draw PPP Loans and will continue to accept applications until March 31, 2021. SBA is also accepting Second Draw PPP loan applications from participating lenders. To locate a lender near you, please click on the link.

1/29/21 13:36,Help for Your Small Business is On the Way,"
￼


Dear Neighbor,

Are you a small business or nonprofit owner that has been struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic? Want to know more about what federal assistance is available to you? 

This week, I held a webinar with our local Small Business Administration (SBA) where we discussed the aid that is available through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). This program offers forgivable federal loans to help cover business expenses and keep employees on payroll. Coming soon there will also be new resources to help some businesses that have had to close. 

If you’re a small business owner (including a sole proprietor, museum, venue, or nonprofit) I encourage you to watch the full discussion here.  
￼

As you might remember, Congress created the PPP last year to help small business who are the backbone of our economy and are struggling under the weight of the COVID-19 pandemic. The newest round of funding offers even more support with an emphasis on those in underserved sectors of our economy. 

In the meantime, here is a summary of the most important things to know as of January 27, 2021. The most up to date information on SBA programs can be found here. You can also contact our local SBA Office by calling (305)-536-5521. 

FIRST-TIME BORROWERS

If your business or nonprofit did not receive a PPP loan prior to August 9th, 2020, you may be eligible for a First Draw PPP loan. Business entities, sole proprietors, independent contractors, nonprofits, veterans’ organizations, houses of worship, and tribal businesses all still qualify, but housing cooperatives, destination marketing organizations, and Chambers of Commerce are also now eligible as well. You must apply on or before March 31st, 2021 to qualify. 

SECOND-TIME BORROWERS

For borrowers that previously received a PPP loan, have 300 employees or less, and suffered a 25 percent reduction of gross receipts, you may be eligible for a Second Draw PPP loan. Eligible restaurants are now able to apply for higher amounts than the first round of loans, so check with your lender for more information. To qualify for this loan, you must have used or will use the full amount of your first PPP loan amount before the second is given to you. Second Draw PPP applicants should contact their lender and apply on or before March 31st, 2021 to qualify.

Dear Fellow Nevadan, 
Welcome to this week’s edition of the Senate Briefing. With President Biden, Vice President Harris, and a new Congress, we’ve been hard at work confirming cabinet secretaries, introducing new bills, and more.  Together, we’re going to build back better from this pandemic. 

￼
Last week, Senator Cortez Masto and I met with brave Nevada National Guard members serving in DC, and had the opportunity to administer the reenlistment oath for some of them. We are forever grateful for our servicemembers who courageously serve in our military to defend our freedoms and for their enormous sacrifices in service to our country. 
￼

￼
This week, I re-introduced a package of three bipartisan bills from last Congress to help bring jobs back to Nevada.  The Hire Student Veterans Act will create opportunities for student veterans using their GI benefits to take advantage of valuable paid internships or work opportunities while in school and make it easier for businesses to hire them.
￼
The Advanced Manufacturing Jobs in America Act will invest in education and training to get Americans back to work in high-paying advanced manufacturing jobs. 
￼
The FRESH AIR for Businesses Act will help support our businesses and nonprofits by providing a 50% tax rebate up to $15,000 per location for them to upgrade air ventilation, filtration, and purification systems to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and build consumer confidence.

Nevada lawmakers working to get more COVID vaccine
""Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., said she is ‘working with the governor’s office to find ways to increase access to vaccines at the federal level.’ Rosen is a member of the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee. She signed onto a recent letter to the Trump administration urging it to actively engage with states’ vaccine distribution efforts. The coronavirus relief package passed by Congress in December included $9 billion for the CDC and the states for vaccine distribution. Of that, Nevada is to receive $47 million, Rosen said.  ‘I’m hopeful that the Biden administration will implement their distribution strategy and quickly address concerns levied by the state,’ Rosen said.”

1/29/21 13:02,Blaine’s Bulletin: A Record Number of Executive Orders,"￼ 
January 29, 2021
For Immediate Release | Contact: Georgeanna Sullivan (202) 225-2956 

BLAINE’S BULLETIN: A RECORD NUMBER OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS
Well, that didn’t take long. After months of promising unity and pledging to be the President for every American in his inaugural address, it only took a few hours for President Biden to issue executive orders to appease the coastal far left at the expense of the middle of the country.
The pursuit of American energy independence has had a massive impact on the U.S., creating good paying jobs, particularly in the upper Midwest, reduced energy costs for every American, and benefitting out national security. Despite that, immediately after President Biden’s inauguration he issued an executive order to revoke the Keystone XL Pipeline permit, which was a top demand of the political left. Killing thousands of jobs and potentially raising energy costs when many American households are still struggling with unemployment and paying the bills should be the last thing we would want to do. But when those jobs reside in conservative states and pay the bills of homes that receive the local paper instead of the Washington Post, they seem not to matter as much as others.  
Another day one priority that was carried out purely for political purposes put our homeland security at risk by halting construction of the border wall and ending the emergency declaration at our southern border. The crisis at our southern border continues with human trafficking operations, illicit drugs and violence coming into our country. However, the residents of high-rise apartment buildings and gated communities find the security they enjoy daily too unseemly for our citizens living on the boarder. Despite his responsibility for the safety of every citizen, President Biden appears set on governing like a radical leftist and is catering to their extreme demands like amnesty for illegal immigrants and defunding ICE. Our nation has endured a great deal over the last year and as we focus on rebuilding and getting back on our feet as a country, we shouldn’t be forced to worry whether or not our borders are secure. 
One thing we should all agree on is the World Health Organization’s (WHO) blatant mismanagement of Covid-19. Instead of working with the civilized world to address the threat, WHO attempted to cover up the spread of the coronavirus after its origins were traced to China. President Trump took decisive action and withdrew from this organization that was not looking out for America’s best interest and instead used those resources elsewhere to support recovery efforts. Even so, an executive order was signed on day one of President Biden’s presidency stating the United States would rejoin the WHO. Why? Because the left demands that anything accomplished over the last four years be reversed as soon as possible, regardless of merit.
Executive orders are not new. They’re not necessarily wrong, and the President is well within his rights to use the powers of the executive order as many Presidents before him have done. President Trump signed four in his first week in office. President Obama signed five. However, President Biden’s 22 executive orders in his first week in office is nothing short of excessive and overreaching considering these are unilateral decisions being made without Congressional oversight. Fortunately, most major policy shifts cannot be done without Congress. Our Founding Fathers created a system of checks and balances that gives the Legislative Branch oversight authority and the sole responsibility of writing laws. While President Biden sits in the Oval Office trying to undo President Trump’s accomplishments as fast as he can, my Republican colleagues and I will not stand for this top-down style of governance and plan to continue fighting for the things that really matter right now. We need to get every student in America back in school before any more of them fall behind. We need to focus on distributing the vaccine to everyone who wants it throughout our state, and continue to do everything possible to support Missouri small businesses and our state’s economic recovery. Those priorities, not political point scoring, is what so many of you tell me you want to see, and it’s exactly what I’ll keep pursuing.

1/29/21 12:53,Save Hyde,"￼ 
SAVE HYDE 

The Hyde Amendment bans taxpayer-funded abortions and was first passed in 1976 with overwhelming bipartisan support. It’s been included in spending packages over the last four decades and has saved an estimated 2.4 million babies’ lives since being enacted.

￼

Now the radical left is attempting to break decades of bipartisan consensus and placing the Hyde Amendment on the chopping block. That’s why I joined 199 of my House Republican colleagues pledging to Save Hyde and will oppose any government funding bill that eliminates or weakens the Hyde Amendment or other current-law, pro-life appropriations provisions.

￼

Reopen Schools Now! 

For months I’ve sounded the alarm about the need for schools throughout the country to safely reopen and allow families choice on whether or not to return to in-person learning. The negative impacts of school closures have been well-documented and include failing grades, mental health issues, and overall well-being. Despite doctors, health experts and most recently the CDC stating there is evidence that schools can safely reopen with proper safety protocols, teachers unions are forcing some public schools to stay closed. 

￼

Last Congress, as a member of the House Education and Labor Committee, I introduced the Educational Flexibility for Families Act, legislation that requires K-12 schools to provide an option for students to safely attend in-person classes for the upcoming school year in order to be eligible for additional federal assistance. I will keep fighting for our students and families to ensure they have the option to learn in-person.

Thank You, Georgia National Guard!

This week I was proud to join our entire Georgia Congressional Delegation in a bipartisan letter thanking our Georgia National Guard for their work in helping to protect the U.S. Capitol over the past few weeks.

Highlight from our letter: “As Members of Congress, we are immensely grateful for the sacrifices made by the Georgia National Guard these past two weeks. As fellow Georgians, we could not be more proud of their skill, bravery, and integrity.”

Fighting for American Energy Independence

Shortly after speaking about the need for unity, President Biden made several unilateral orders targeted at American oil and gas producers that will eliminate millions of jobs and roll back progress made toward American energy independence, including blocking the Keystone XL Pipeline, banning new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters, rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, and more.

This week I joined 36 of my colleagues in asking President Biden to reverse these harmful actions before they become final. You can read our full letter here.

Remembering Georgia Legend Hank Aaron

This week I joined Congressman David Scott (GA-13) and members of the Georgia and Alabama delegations in introducing a resolution honoring the life and legacy of Henry “Hank” Louis Aaron, who passed away on January 22, 2021.

Hank was a legendary Atlanta Braves baseball player and was known not only for breaking Babe Ruth’s home run record, but for overcoming racial barriers during the Jim Crow era.

￼

President Biden’s first week in office was full of enacting many misguided, unilateral and divisive orders, including one that diminishes the rights of women and girls in sports. In this new Executive Order, any school that receives federal funding must allow biological boys who self-identify as girls play on girls’ sports teams, or they will face administrative action from the Department of Education. 

That’s why I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act, legislation that ensures women and girls have a fair playing field in competitive sports by ensuring that school athletics comply with the Title IX recognition of a person’s reproductive biology and genetics at birth.

As always, my office is here to help. You can email me ⇒ HERE, contact any of our offices or join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.

1/29/21 12:50,Remembering the Holocaust,"The Durbin Report: A message from Senator Richard J. Durbin 
￼


Fellow Illinoisan,   Seventy-six years ago this week, scouts from the Soviet Red Army pushed their way through Poland. They stumbled on a place that haunts the world to this day—Auschwitz.  It was the largest of Nazi Germany’s death camps, forty sprawling acres of hell on earth.   Between 1940 and 1945, 1.1 million men, women, and children died at Auschwitz.  More than 950,000 of those killed were Jews.  We must never allow ourselves to forget what happened there.  
￼
DURBIN RECOGNIZES HOLOCAUST REMEMBRANCE DAY ON THE SENATE FLOOR 
Three weeks ago this week, an angry mob attacked our nation’s Capitol as Congress gathered to fulfill our Constitutional obligation to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election.     Many scenes from that day haunt us, but for some the most painful image of that day was of a middle-aged white man proudly wearing a sweatshirt that read: “Camp Auschwitz” and the words: “Work makes you free” — a paraphrase of the cruel slogan atop the black iron gates leading into Auschwitz.  It was a sickening reminder that the kind of hatred that led to the Holocaust is not some long-forgotten thing of the past.  It lives in America to this day.    For far too long, our government has failed to adequately monitor the danger posed by violent white supremacists and other extremist groups.  While we looked the other way, the threat grew.  That’s why I have introduced the Domestic Terrorism Prevention Act in each Congress since 2017, and I plan to reintroduce it soon in this Congress.   Congress must address the hate-fueled extremism that was on display at the Capitol on January 6.  We cannot afford to waste another moment. As the incoming Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I plan to hold hearings to examine this threat. And I will work to pass my bill and to get President Biden to sign it into law.   Sincerely,   U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL)

1/29/21 12:31,"Baldwin Takes Action to Limit 2021 Out-of-Pocket Health Care Costs, Reverse Trump Administration Rule","

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
Senator Baldwin, a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), reintroduced legislation this week to reverse a damaging rule change made by the Trump administration that increased out-of-pocket costs for millions of Americans and made fewer Americans eligible for the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) premium tax credits, while also causing those who are eligible to receive less in tax credit support.   The Trump administration changed the index by which eligibility for the ACA’s premium tax credits and maximum out-of-pocket limits are set each year, resulting in a 2.5 percent increase in the maximum out-of-pocket limit in 2020 compared to where out-of-pocket limits would have been under the old indexing factor. This change resulted in a $200 increase in the cap on out-of-pocket costs for individuals, and a $400 per year increase for families.   
“The Trump administration spent four years working to sabotage our health system, and more Americans are uninsured today than when Trump took office,” said Senator Baldwin. “During this unprecedented pandemic, we need to protect and expand access to affordable health insurance. Our reform will help more Americans get the quality health care coverage they need, at a price they can afford.” 
The Trump administration finalized a regulatory adjustment that, beginning in Health Care Plan Year 2020, changed the indexing factor that is used to determine eligibility for the Affordable Care Act’s premium tax credits and calculate the maximum out-of-pocket limit that health plans can set each year. This rule change replaced an indexing factor that is based on premium growth from employer-based plans with a new indexing factor that is based on premium growth across all private plans. Senator Baldwin’s legislation would nullify this change and revert to the former indexing factor, lowering out-of-pocket costs.   For four years, Senator Baldwin has led the fight in the Senate against the Trump administration’s health care sabotage, and she continues working to expand access to quality, affordable health care for everyone. 
	•	Her No Junk Plans Act would overturn the Trump administration’s expansion of junk insurance plans that don’t have to cover people with pre-existing health conditions, and don’t have to cover essential Affordable Care Act health care like prescription drugs, emergency room visits, and maternity care.
	•	Senator Baldwin’s Advancing Youth Enrollment Act would make nearly five million uninsured young adults eligible to receive additional financial support that would help reduce their monthly health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket costs. 
	•	Senator Baldwin’s ENROLL Act would restore funding for the Navigator program that helps American families get the information and support they need to find a quality health care plan at a price they can afford. During his time in office, President Trump slashed federal funding for the Navigator program by 84 percent. Trusted Navigator programs like those in Wisconsin have had their funding cut by nearly 75 percent since 2017, meaning fewer people in Wisconsin have received the support they need to obtain affordable coverage. Senator Baldwin also authored legislation to respond to this need in the context of the current pandemic. Her COVid Enrollment Response (COVER) Act would invest in outreach and enrollment assistance to help more Americans find quality, affordable health insurance during this public health crisis.
Read more about Senator Baldwin’s actions to expand access to quality, affordable health care for Wisconsinites here.

1/29/21 12:11,"New Year, New President, Same Old Problems","￼
Dear    

With 2020 behind us and the first month of the New Year almost complete, there are a few updates I'd like to give you from Washington. 
President Biden 
￼ 
As of January 20th, Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th President of the United States. Although I did not support his candidacy, he is now our Commander-in-Chief, and I will pray for him throughout the next four years. I also echo President Trump's words of encouragement for this administration and I join him in wishing them success. There is no doubt that President Biden has a lot of solid ground and progress to work from after the past four years and I hope he builds off President Trump's great work. 
And while I will look for ways to work with the Biden Administration in areas like rural broadband, Buy America and space exploration, I will not sit by and watch conservative ideals and principles be trampled upon. This has sadly already begun. 

Executive Orders
Despite his inaugural address of claiming to want to unify the nation, President Biden's first week in office has been outreach to the far left in his party. There has been little, if any, effort to reach out to the 74 million + that voted for Donald Trump.
On his first day in office, Joe Biden unraveled large accomplishments from the past four years by signing a slew of Executive Orders. By simply signing his name and bypassing Congress, President Biden is now responsible for the millions of jobs that will be lost in this country.
Take the Keystone XL Pipeline as an example. President Trump fought for the Keystone XL Pipeline, paving the way for its construction and completion. This pipeline would provide thousands of jobs, result in less carbon emissions than other modes of transport and fulfill a multi-billion dollar deal we made with our neighboring ally, Canada. On his first day in office, Joe Biden signed an Executive Order that revoked the permit for this project to continue.  People in rural America naturally have to drive more. 
While liberals in large cities don't care if gas prices go up, it directly impacts the lives of millions of people in rural areas who have to drive to work, and where public transporation is not a realistic solution.  When he was in the Senate, Joe Biden took Amtrak to work everyday.  But he needs to remember that if you live in rural America, getting on the train everday isn't an option, and frankly, not one most people here would want even if it was.
Joe Biden also signed another EO on his first day in office that put the United States back in the Paris Climate Accord. Make no mistake about it, this is a bad deal for the American people. It is estimated that by 2035, the regulations from this climate accord will result in the loss of 400,000 American jobs, a loss of $2.5 trillion in GDP, and increases in household electricity expenditures by 13%-20%. Additionally, the Paris Climate Accord gives China a free pass on regulations, thus giving them an advantage in the market.
Biden also signed an executive order that allows biological males to compete in female sporting events.  This is an action even many Democrats had opposed because it puts biological females at a disadvantage in sporting events.
Biden has now signed more executive orders than any other President in their first week of office.  He has signed more than 30 in his first seven days.  To put that in perspective, President Trump signed just five in his first week and President George W. Bush signed none. For someone who spent the better part of four decades in the legislative branch of government, President Joe Biden seems to be happy to sidestep Congress.

￼ 
The Year Ahead
While January is almost over and we begin a new month in a few days, there is still a long way to go in the remainder of this year. It is my sincere hope that even if President Biden isn't serious about unity, Congress can display cooperation throughout the coming months, putting partisanship aside, and working across the aisle.
To that point, I do not think that impeaching a former President is the way to do that. But Democrats, obsessed with President Trump, have decided to forge ahead with this now pointless trial.
I'm hopeful that once they are finished, we can get back to tackling the issues that matter, together, in order to make our country a better place each day.
  

           Sincerely, 

     ￼

U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) delivered the following remarks on the Senate floor this week applauding the virtual March for Life on January 29th: 
""Normally, we’d be welcoming many thousands of Americans to the capital for the annual March for Life.  ""Every year, the March is one of the most important things that happens in Washington. Americans of all ages, diverse backgrounds, and many faiths speak up peacefully and powerfully for the most fundamental human right.  ""They make our nation confront the fact that even the most modest protections for innocent life are still not secure.  ""The pandemic has taken this year’s march online. That’s a particular pity given signs that the new Administration may be poised to steamroll even the most limited safeguards for conscience, let alone life itself.  ""This new Washington needs to hear the marchers more than ever.  ""Case in point: Word is, our new Administration is planning to rescind the Mexico City Policy this very day -- run over the consciences of American taxpayers and put them back on the hook for funding abortions overseas.  ""An Administration that wanted to pursue unity might observe that 77% of Americans — including a majority of Democrats and 85% of independents — don’t want taxpayer dollars to fund foreign abortions.  ""This and many other common-sense pro-life policies enjoy broad support from the American people. But the radicalism of the modern Democratic party seems dug in.  ""Fortunately, political dynamics change, but the moral truth doesn’t. Executive orders can’t alter the basic science of human life.  ""So I thank my fellow Kentuckians and all Americans who are participating. We’ll see you in person next year.""

I have already taken action to help rural Iowans. I joined my colleagues on a bicameral, bipartisan letter urging the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to ensure their latest broadband initiative provides Iowans with quality, high-speed internet service.  

I also immediately joined the Biofuels Caucus, a bipartisan group of lawmakers focused on supporting biofuels producers by defending the Renewable Fuel Standard and fighting for expanded access to higher biofuel blends. As the number one state in ethanol and biodiesel production, it is imperative that Iowa’s biofuels producers have a seat at the table in Washington. One of my first actions as a member of this caucus was signing a letter urging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to reject pending small refinery exemptions (SREs). 

In addition to serving Iowans on the House Agriculture Committee, I was also selected to serve on the House Committee on the Budget and the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology. On these committees, I will work to address our growing national debt crisis and look for opportunities to advance agricultural technology to improve the lives of Iowa farmers.

FIGHTING FOR OUR MOST VULNERABLE

Unfortunately, with Democrats controlling the House, Senate, and White House, we’ve already seen attacks on pro-life policies -- including an effort to repeal the Hyde Amendment and overturn the Mexico City Policy. These efforts would result in American taxpayers footing the bill for abortions, both here in the U.S. and around the world. 

That is simply unacceptable. Like I said on the 48th Anniversary of Roe v. Wade, my faith teaches me that each person was created for a purpose and a reason. That's why I will always stand up for life.
￼
￼

BONUS

For my birthday this year, I shared donuts with National Guard troops to thank them for their service to our country. I'm very grateful for the Capitol Police, law enforcement officers, and National Guard troops who helped protect and defend our Capital. May God bless our troops!

Bergman Introduces International Spending Transparency Act

Washington - Today, Rep. Jack Bergman reintroduced his legislation to require an audit of U.S. contributions to multilateral and international organizations. This legislation is based on recommendations from the Republican Study Committee’s Task Force on National Security and Foreign Affairs report released in 2020.

Rep. Bergman was joined by former RSC Chairman, Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA), and fellow Task Force members Rep. Joe Wilson (R-SC), and Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) as original cosponsors.
""Our government lacks any real analysis of how U.S. taxpayer dollars are being spent by international organizations and whether or not those funds are being used to advance U.S. interests. Billions of dollars each year go to entities like the United Nations but we have no reporting on what happens to that money and where it ultimately ends up. It’s time for a transparent, independent audit of these funds to ensure better oversight of the money our constituents are ultimately paying for,” said Rep. Bergman. 
The International Spending Transparency Act would direct the State Department to conduct an annual audit of United States contributions to multilateral and international organizations.
The audit will include information related to:
	•	The total amount of U.S. contributions to recipient multilateral and international organizations and the purpose for each contribution;
	•	An analysis of whether the receiving entity achieved the purpose of the contribution;
	•	An analysis of waste, fraud or abuse by receiving entity; and
	•	Whether any receiving entity in turn provided funds either directly or indirectly to:
	•	The People’s Republic of China
	•	The Russian Federation
	•	The Islamic Republic of Iran
	•	The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea
	•	The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela
	•	The Syrian Arab Republic
	•	Any organization designated as a foreign terrorist organization
The Daily Signal released an article in December outlining the importance of this legislation. In the 116th Congress, this bill was introduced as H.R. 8907.

Boozman Bulletin: A Voice for the Voiceless 
I’m proud to receive an A+ pro-life rating on the Susan B. Anthony List for my record promoting the value of life. Defending the most vulnerable among us is one of the most important things we can do because every life is precious. I am committed to protecting innocent and unborn children, supporting policies that end abortion and preventing groups participating in the destruction and devaluing of human life from receiving taxpayer dollars. We can be encouraged by how the pro-life movement continues to expand as we unite to defend the sanctity of human life. Today, people around the country will participate in the virtual March for Life rally and demonstrate their support for protecting the unborn. I’m lending my voice in support of this cause. 
￼
  
This week I also helped re-introduce several pro-life bills including: 
	•	The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act: There is no clearer indication that America is in moral crisis than to understand that babies in the womb feel pain as early as 20 weeks old, yet are still allowed to be victims of gruesome abortion procedures that end their lives in agonizing fashion. Science and medical technology increasingly affirm this truth. It is past time for us to protect these innocent, vulnerable lives and spare them from that fate. I’m thankful my colleagues are standing together in support of this legislation that promotes the value and dignity of every human being.  
	•	No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act: Currently, policies that regulate federal funding for abortions, like the long-standing Hyde Amendment, have to be reapproved each year and could be terminated. This bill would eliminate the need for annual action and ensure a permanent, government-wide prohibition on funding for abortions.  
	•	Down Syndrome Discrimination by Abortion Prohibition Act: This legislation would prohibit abortion based on an unborn child having Down syndrome. Every life is a precious gift, and unborn babies diagnosed with Down syndrome are no exception. Every human being is capable of accomplishing amazing things that exceed expectations and add much value and joy to the lives and families they are fortunate to be part of. I am honored to stand up and speak out on their behalf and on behalf of those yet to be born so that they can realize their full potential and purpose. Our world would be less bright and loving without them.  
	•	Women’s Public Health and Safety Act: This legislation gives states the authority to exclude abortion providers, like Planned Parenthood, from receiving Medicaid funds. Under current law, states are required to allow any qualified provider to participate in a state’s Medicaid system. A non-partisan Government Accountability Office report revealed that Planned Parenthood received nearly $1.3 billion in Medicaid  reimbursements over a three-year period, accounting for 81 percent of the abortion provider’s joint federal-state funding stream.  
	•	Born-Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act: This bill aims to protect newborns who survive an attempted abortion. It would create criminal penalties for doctors who allow infants surviving abortion to die rather than provide them medical care, and also require that born-alive abortion survivors be transported to a hospital for treatment.
_____________________________________________________________________________   Helping Businesses Comply with Immigration Laws   This week I helped introduce legislation that prevents illegal immigrants from taking jobs meant for American workers and legal immigrants while ensuring employers have the tools they need to certify a legal workforce. The Accountability Through Electronic Verification Act would permanently authorize and require employers to use the E-Verify program, an internet-based system that assists employers in determining the eligibility of employees allowed to work in the United States.   Employers need a commonsense, cost-effective tool that allows them to hire with confidence. Law enforcement must be empowered to hold bad actors accountable when they willfully violate immigration rules while hiring employees. E-Verify does both. It has a proven track record of success and should be permanently reauthorized and made mandatory for employers.   Currently, employers voluntarily submit information reported on an employee’s Form I-9 to the Department of Homeland Security through the E-Verify system, which works in partnership with the Social Security Administration to determine worker eligibility. There is no cost for employers to use E-Verify.   _____________________________________________________________________________   Economic Impact Payment Resources   Arkansans have a lot of questions about the Economic Impact Payment (EIP) that Congress approved at the end of 2020. The media often refers to these payments as ‘stimulus checks.'   The IRS has been issuing these payments. The best place to start in finding the status of a payment is the Get My Payment button on the IRS website. This will show if and when the payment was processed. It is important to note that it is taking approximately three to four weeks from that processing date to receive the payment. Arkansans with a January 6 date on the IRS website have told me they just received their check in the mail this week.  If the IRS website indicates the payment status is “unavailable” you may still be able to get one. The IRS added a line to this year’s tax forms so you can claim an unreceived EIP from both 2020 and 2021. You will have to file a tax return to see if there is any money through the Recovery Rebate Credit.    
￼
  I understand this impacts many Arkansans who don’t normally file a tax return. If you need help with this to pursue your EIP, check out the file for free resources from the IRS or find the closest Volunteer Income Tax Assistance site.   _____________________________________________________________________________   Arkansas COVID-19 Vaccine Update   Arkansas is currently in Phase 1-B of its COVID-19 distribution plan. Educators who work in K-12, child care and higher education, individuals age 70 or older and all Arkansans eligible in Phase 1-A including health care workers, residents and staff at long-term care facilities and other high priority groups are qualified to receive the vaccine.     The Arkansas Department of Health has a helpful map showing locations around the state administering the vaccine. To learn more about the state’s vaccination plan click here.   Veterans enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) also have the option of receiving a vaccine from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical system. The VHA is following CDC vaccine distribution guidelines, which can differ from the state-by-state plans. Currently, the VA is vaccinating veterans who are 75 and older, those on dialysis, undergoing chemotherapy, have had a transplant or who are homeless.   Veterans will receive a call from the VA’s Vaccination Team to schedule their appointment when they are eligible. To get more information on this process and sign-up for automatic updates on vaccine availability click here.

Bilingual Tele-Town Hall Recap
￼
Click here to watch my tele-town hall

On Saturday, January 23, 2021, I held a bilingual tele-town hall about the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and the latest information on the El Paso vaccination program, the second round of Economic Impact Payments, and unemployment benefits. I was joined by local experts from the El Paso Office of Emergency Management, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), and Workforce Solutions Borderplex. Our local experts shared important updates and answered questions about the COVID-19 pandemic and resources available to El Pasoans, and I want to make sure you have this information.
You can watch the full video of my tele-town hall HERE and download a comprehensive Q&A document HERE.
COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout in El Paso
As we continue to see a rise in COVID-19 cases in our community again, it’s clear that the fight against the virus is far from over, and this is not the time to let our guard down. Each and every one of us must do our part and stay home unless we absolutely need to leave for an essential activity. I recognize that not enough El Pasoans are being vaccinated fast enough. In the last week, I have worked closely with city and county leaders to ensure that the priorities of our community are heard at the highest levels within the new White House.
I have also been fighting for a binational COVID-19 strategy for our border region. Last Congress, I introduced the Binational Health Strategies Act to develop a binational strategic plan to protect border communities like ours against COVID-19. I also spoke with members of President Biden’s team during the transition period about the importance of a binational strategy and wrote a letter to the COVID-19 Czar, Jeffrey Zients.
El Paso has been leading the state of Texas in immunization, and I am fighting for the funding needed to accelerate the free, fair, and equitable distribution of the vaccine to all El Pasoans who want the vaccine as soon as possible. This week, I sent a letter to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) requesting to have a community vaccination center established in El Paso. Community vaccination centers will provide federal support to communities to assist and expedite the distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines. If you would like to read my letter, please click HERE.
Scientists and doctors have worked around the clock to ensure that we have a COVID-19 vaccine that is effective and safe. With the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines across El Paso and our country, we now see a bright light at the end of the tunnel.
Immunization with the COVID-19 vaccine is a critical component to stop the spread of the virus, hospitalizations, and deaths. I recognize that El Pasoans are anxious to receive the vaccine, and unfortunately, El Paso hasn’t received enough vaccines to cover the entire community from the state. My office has been flooded with messages from constituents that don’t know how to get the vaccine, if they’re available to them, or what information to believe. On my tele-town hall, Chief Jorge Rodriguez from the El Paso Office of Emergency Management provided the latest updates and answered questions and concerns about the City’s vaccine rollout plan. You can watch Chief Jorge Rodriguez update HERE and download our Q&A document HERE.
Currently, the City of El Paso is administering COVID-19 vaccines to El Pasoans who meet the 1A and 1B criteria. Phase 1A recipients include frontline healthcare workers and residents in long-term care facilities. Phase 1B recipients include people 65 years of age and older and people 16 years of age and older with at least one chronic medical condition that puts them at increased risk for severe illness or death from COVID-19. If you fall into one of these categories, you may now be able to receive a vaccine depending on supplies and can pre-register on the City’s website, or by calling their COVID-19 hotline at 915-212-6843. Vaccines have also been distributed to other local providers and I encourage you to visit the Texas Department of State Health Services website to find a provider near you.
Second Economic Impact Payment
Since early last year, Congress has worked to enact several stimulus packages, with the most recent being signed into law on December 27th, 2020. While the final package fell well short of meaningfully addressing our priorities, the agreement included a new round of direct payments worth up to $600 per individual ($1,200 for those married filing jointly) and an additional $600 per qualifying child. We were also able to secure this benefit for mixed-status families, meaning if a spouse does not have a social security number but the other spouse does, the spouse with the social security number will receive $600. Evelyn Dyson Lee from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) joined my tele-town hall to answer questions about the first and second rounds of economic impact payments. You can watch her update HERE and download our Q&A document HERE.
All checks needed to be direct deposited or physically sent out by January 15th, 2021, so if you have not yet received your payment, go to the IRS website and use the Get My Economic Impact Payment tool to get the status of your payment.  If you have not received your payment, my office may be able to help. Please call our office at (915) 541-1400 or visit my website for more information.
Unemployment Benefits for El Pasoans  Impacted by COVID-19
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in El Paso have been catastrophic and deeply painful. Consequently, thousands of El Pasoans have lost their jobs and income to support their families. The latest COVID-19 relief package that was signed into law on December 27, 2020, extended the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) to March 14, 2021, and allows individuals receiving benefits to continue through April 5, 2021, as long as the individual has not reached the maximum number of weeks.
Lucio Glenn from the Workforce Solutions Borderplex joined my tele-town hall to explain the process of applying for resources on the Texas Workforce Commission website, shared job resources that are available to El Pasoans, and answered important questions. You can watch his update HERE and download my Q&A document HERE.
Testing and Additional Resources
The fight against COVID-19 is far from over, and this is not the time to let our guard down. We have to do our part and stay home unless we absolutely need to leave for an essential activity. We all have a role to play in slowing the spread and protecting ourselves, our family, and our community. 
New information about COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccine rollout plan is coming out daily, please visit my resource page on my website for the latest updates, recommendations from the CDC, and a Frequently Asked Questions section to know the latest. Additionally, visit the sites below to stay up to date.
The CDC provides updates on the virus and safety information for the public and healthcare professionals, as well as Frequently Asked Questions available here. 
The City of El Paso has a hotline for residents to call for more information regarding COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccine. The number is 915-21-COVID, or 915-212-6843.
If you need to get tested because you believe you’ve been exposed to COVID-19 or are experiencing symptoms, please get tested. The City of El Paso also offers mobile testing centers throughout the city that are now open and are free of charge for any symptomatic or asymptomatic person. So, whether you are exhibiting symptoms or not, you can get tested! For more information on locations and operating hours, please click here. 
The Texas Department of State Health Services provides updates on the disease's spread within the state.
The safety and well-being of you and your loved ones is of the utmost importance. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact my office via email at Veronica.Escobar@mail.house.gov or by phone at 915-541-1400.  Sincerely,

January 28, 2021
Dear friend,
Since February 2020, the world has grappled with a ruthless public health crisis due to the outbreak of COVID-19. Since then, 429,000 Americans have lost their lives due to this virus, including 2,465 San Diegans.
The development and approval of vaccines provide a glimmer of hope to finally end this pandemic, but distributing the COVID-19 vaccines and getting them into people’s arms proves to be a monumental task among local, state and federal governments.
Although the situation remains fluid, some San Diegans have concerns, including the order in which the public is being vaccinated, the number of doses available in hospitals, the way in which the public is being notified about important vaccine updates, and vaccine site information among others.
Please join us for an informative event next week. As part of our series of virtual town halls where I invite my colleagues in Congress and experts to present information to San Diegans, we'll discuss the state of the vaccine rollout in San Diego and provide updates on the continued efforts to fight this virus.
I will be joined by Dr. Shane Crotty from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology and Dr. Corinne McDaniels-Davidson, Director of the Institute for Public Health (IPH) at San Diego State University.

￼

Event Details
Date: Wednesday, February 3rd Time: 5:00 - 6:15 P.M. Location: Virtual via Cisco Webex - see link below

1/28/21 18:39,National Guard Treatment,"
￼ 
Protecting our National Guard Heroes 
Over the weekend, infuriated by the shoddy treatment of our U.S. National Guard deployed to the U.S. Capitol Complex, I led 33 fellow House Republicans in demanding that the Guardsmen receive better living accommodations, safe and sanitary conditions, and full access to all available amenities. Furthermore, my colleagues and I have volunteered the full use of our personal Washington, D.C. offices as living quarters, rest areas, or whatever may be needed to improve the situation.
As you likely know, after the tragic incidents on January 6, 20,000 National Guardsmen – twice the number currently serving in Afghanistan and Iraq – were deployed to guard the U.S. Capitol to provide security for President Biden’s inauguration. Troops came from all 50 states, 3 U.S. territories, and Washington, D.C.. When the Guardsmen arrived, Washington welcomed them with open arms. Members of Congress gave tours of the Capitol and local residents handed out pizzas and donuts. Yet, beyond all the warm words and photo ops, the National Guard has in fact received pitiful treatment.
In our own nation’s capital, an area surrounded by numerous hotels and military installations, these brave men and women were forced to sleep on cold marble floors with no cots or even sleeping bags, all the while protecting the Capitol Building in 12-hour shifts. Worse still, on January 21, the day after the inauguration, rather than being allowed to enjoy the comfort of the buildings they are here to protect, where they can access comfortable seating, bathrooms, showers, and simple amenities like cell phone chargers, the National Guard was abruptly forced out of the Capitol Complex without reason and were instead discarded to cramped, exhaust-filled parking garages. This is beyond unacceptable. It is a breach of faith. Fortunately, outrage from the public and elected officials ensured that this unpatriotic decision was quickly reversed. However, the question of principle remains: If the National Guard cannot receive adequate treatment while deployed to our own Capitol Building, what sort of conditions can they expect overseas?
My colleagues and I have demanded a full explanation of how this shameful situation unfolded, as well as a detailed plan as to how the National Guard will be accommodated going forward. Furthermore, I have urged that the Guardsmen be allowed to return home if no genuine security threat remains. Frustrated by the poor conditions, many governors have already called their National Guard units home, but thousands are still stationed here.
For as long as the National Guard remains in Washington, my office will be open during business hours to provide much needed Southern hospitality. If you or someone you know is deployed to the Capitol and is in need, please contact my office!

Preserving History at the Kettle Creek Battlefield 
I am delighted to announce that the Kettle Creek Battlefield, the site of a key Revolutionary War engagement in Washington, GA, has now been recognized as an affiliated area of the National Park Service!
After nearly a century of pushing for recognition, the tireless efforts of Wilkes County, the Kettle Creek Battlefield Association, the American Battlefield Trust, the Georgia Battlefields Association, the Georgia Piedmont Land Trust, the Watson-Brown Foundation, and many others have finally paid off. It has been an honor to work with these dedicated men and women. This is an enormous win for all of those involved in preserving and caring for this magnificent 40 acres of land and its history. 
On February 14th, 1779, a sizeable force of British Loyalist militia collided with a small but ferocious band of American patriots led by Colonel Andrew Pickens in the area around Kettle Creek. Outnumbered 2-to-1, Colonel Pickens and his men suddenly attacked the Tory militia, catching them by surprise. In a bitter and brutal fight, which featured tremendous bravery on both sides, the Patriot forces decimated the British Loyalists. This battle involved only a few hundred men but had an outsized impact on the course of the entire Revolutionary War, demonstrating that the British would never be able to pacify the South’s frontier back country.
Kettle Creek Battlefield is in Georgia’s 10th District, and I look forward to continuing to work with community partners in caring for this important place in American history so that it is preserved for future generations.

Day of Tears
The history of any great nation is marked by dark days. One such moment was January 22, 1973, the day on which the U.S. Supreme Court decided the landmark Roe v. Wade case. In this wildly irresponsible decision, the Supreme Court far outreached its own power by sidestepping Congress to legalize abortion in the United States. As a result, in the 48 years since, tens of millions of unborn children have lost their lives to abortion.
To commemorate this sad moment, on January 22, 2021, I proudly introduced H.Res. 58, a resolution to recognize January 22 as the “Day of Tears” and to encourage Americans to lower our nation’s flag to half-staff to memorialize the millions of lives ended before they could even begin. It is my dearest hope that this tragic anniversary will become a day of remembrance and hope for ending the practice of denying unborn children God’s greatest gift of life.
The full bill text for H.Res. 58 can be found here.

Hice Headliner
Each month, I recognize one outstanding local citizen who goes above and beyond to help their neighbors and strengthen the community. It’s my pleasure to award the first “Hice Headliner” of 2021 to Tasha Pounds of Baldwin County. 
The manager of Johnnie McDade’s Grocery, a full-service grocery store and meat market in Milledgeville, Tasha began her career there as a cashier 23 years ago. Back then, she had no idea that one day she would be on the frontlines of a global pandemic. 
During COVID-19, Tasha has continued to work and provide citizens with a safe and healthy shopping experience. From taking extra precautions to sanitize the store to keeping high-demand products in stock and on the shelves, Tasha has helped to ensure that community members have what they need during these unprecedented times. We are proud to recognize one of our extraordinary citizens, Tasha Pounds, for her service to her community, and we thank all those who have risen to the challenge and continued to perform essential services during these challenging times.

Touring the District
Yesterday, I toured the newly renovated Bobby Parham Kitchen on the campus of Renaissance Park at Central State Hospital in Milledgeville. The 123,000 square foot facility holding state-of-the-art equipment is now home to Food Service Partners of Georgia, LLC. I appreciated the opportunity to learn about its plans to employ 200 people and utilize Georgia grown products as the company prepares meals to be sent to medical institutions and other facilities across the country.  Justin Bizzarrro and Deborah Micas, of Food Service Partners, thanks for the tour! 
￼
Afterwards, I attended a lunch meeting with Central State Hospital Local Redevelopment Authority (CSHLRA) Director Mike Couch, CSHLRA Board Chairman Johnny Grant, Baldwin County Commissioner Sammy Hall, and Milledgeville Councilwoman Jeanette Walden. I enjoyed the opportunity to discuss issues facing our rural communities, such as rural broadband and care for our veterans, as well as ways federal, state, and local officials can work together to achieve redevelopment projects.

Should U.S Foreign Aid Money Be Used to Pay for Abortions?
 
  
Lindsey,  Earlier today, President Joe Biden signed an executive order reversing the pro-life ""Mexico City policy."" As a result, U.S. foreign aid money may now be used to fund non-governmental organizations overseas that promote and perform abortion. The Biden Administration order, titled ""Memorandum on Protecting Women's Health at Home and Abroad,"" rescinds the previous administration's restrictions that ensured taxpayers were not required to pay for abortions in other countries. 
 
  
 
Do you support the Biden Administration's executive order allowing U.S. foreign aid money to fund abortions?
 
  
 
Yes
 
  
 
No
 
  
 
None of the above
 
  
  
Submit survey to sign up for updates on my work in Congress.*
  
First implemented in 1985 by executive order under President Ronald Reagan, the Mexico City policy required all foreign non-governmental organizations to certify that funds would not be used to perform or promote abortion. According to a recent poll, 77 percent of Americans oppose using taxpayer dollars to perform abortions overseas.
 
Last week, I was honored to receive an A+ Rating on the Susan B. Anthony List National Pro-Life Scorecard for my efforts to protect the sanctity of life as your representative in Congress. I believe government should never be allowed to spend Americans' hard-earned taxpayer dollars in such a way. Instead, we should focus on actually promoting and advancing the health and well-being of individuals, both born and unborn. 
 
I want to hear your thoughts. Please take a moment to complete my survey and let me know where you stand on this important issue.

1/28/21 17:54,"Baldwin Takes Action to Fully Fund Title I, Special Education Programs","

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
This week, Senator Baldwin announced her support for the reintroduction of the Keep Our Promise to America’s Children and Teachers (PACT) Act, legislation to put Congress on a fiscally-responsible path to fully fund Title I and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) on a mandatory basis. 
“Long before the pandemic, many of our children were already facing obstacles in their learning experiences, and many of our teachers continue to lack the resources they need in the classroom. I’ve heard from students, parents, and educators in Wisconsin and it’s clear we need to do more to ensure all students have access to the quality education they deserve,” said Senator Baldwin. “Title I and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act are important tools that help students in lower-income neighborhoods and students with disabilities get ahead. Our reform is the next step in making sure our schools receive the federal funding they need to support our teachers and help every student succeed, no matter where they live.” 
Title I, which gives assistance to America’s highest-need schools, is a critical tool to ensure that every child, no matter the zip code, has access to a quality education. However, it has been deeply underfunded, shortchanging our most vulnerable students living in poverty. According to the National Education Association, the Title I formula was underfunded in Fiscal Year 2019 by $29 billion.   Similarly, IDEA calls on the federal government to fund 40 percent of the cost of special education, but Congress has never fully funded the law. According to the National Education Association, IDEA state grants are currently funded at just 13.8 percent – the lowest percentage since 2000. The Keep Our PACT Act, led by Senator Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) and U.S. Representative Susie Lee (D-NV), would create a 10-year mandatory glide path to fully fund both Title I and IDEA, ensuring that education is a priority in the federal budget.   Over 30 education, civil rights, and disability rights organizations nationwide, including the American Federation of Teachers, the National Center for Learning Disabilities, Journey for Justice Alliance, the National Education Association and The Arc support the bill and agree: 
“More than forty years ago, Congress made a commitment to help level the playing field and educate every kid in this country, regardless of their ability, what kind of neighborhood they live in, and the color of their skin. Now, as the COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare the inequities across our school systems, it is even more important for Congress to fix its chronic underfunding IDEA and Title I, the very programs that are geared to strengthening supports for children with disabilities and making opportunities available for all children, especially those who live in struggling communities who need them most. In public schools across America, resources are scarce for special education and disability assistance, guidance counselors, mental health services, school nurses, librarians and teaching assistants. The challenges facing our public schools cost money: the resources to help kids succeed are there, we just have to prioritize them,” said Randi Weingarten, President of the American Federation of Teachers.   “The COVID-19 pandemic has laid bare and worsened the persistent inequities in our schools, particularly for students with disabilities, students from low-income backgrounds, and students of color. Bold action must be taken to ensure schools can effectively and equitably serve all students now and as our nation recovers from the pandemic. We thank Senator Van Hollen for his leadership in introducing the Keep Our Promise to America's Children and Teachers Act and his recognition that the chronic underfunding of IDEA and Title I of ESSA must not continue,” said Lindsay Jones, President & CEO, National Center for Learning Disabilities.   “As Black communities demand racial justice, equity must be more than a soundbites, but policy that demonstrates a clear commitment to heal injustice.  The Keep our Pact Act is equitable education policy that invests significantly in our low income and special education students.  The Journey for Justice Alliance enthusiastically supports!” said Jitu Brown, National Director of the Journey for Justice Alliance.    “All students — no matter where they come from or where they live — deserve the opportunity for a great public education that meets their needs and opens doors for them. The ‘Keep Our Promise to America’s Children and Teachers Act’ will make students, especially students with disabilities, a funding and investment priority. As the nation continues grappling with a growing teacher shortage, which the COVID-19 pandemic and accompanying economic crisis have exacerbated, this country continues to face mounting wealth and income inequality. Now is the time for Congress to invest responsibly so that the futures of our nation’s public school students are secure. The National Education Association commends Sen. Chris Van Hollen for reintroducing this priority legislation as their first bill in the 117th Congress,” said Becky Pringle, President of the National Education Association.    “The Arc of the United States is grateful to the drafters of the PACT Act, and their recognition of the need for the Federal government to finally pay its promised share of the expense of providing a free and appropriate public education to all students with disabilities. This funding is desperately needed as local school districts have been stretched and stressed by COVID-19. In order to have truly individualized and comprehensive supports for all students, no matter their level of need, the full Federal funding of IDEA is imperative,” said Nicole Jorwic, Senior Director of Public Policy, the Arc.

Congressman Donalds' Statement Calling on an Immediate Investigation into Citadel, LLC., and Robinhood
 
WASHINGTON––Today, Congressman Byron Donalds (R-FL) joins a growing bipartisan group calling for an immediate investigation into Citadel, LLC., and Robinhood following the alleged predatory and manipulative conduct that resulted in massive market instability. 
 
“American ingenuity and innovation have given the average citizen access to online trading platforms allowing interested parties access to a free-market economy with hopes to enhance their financial well-being. The recent alleged unethical and predatory actions exhibited by Citadel, LLC., and Robinhood that led to detrimental market instability and widespread consequential financial hardship on many investors requires an immediate investigation by the House Committee on Financial Services.”
 
“Congress must examine the recent activity concerning GameStop (GME), AMC Entertainment (AMC), Nokia Telecommunications company (NOK), and other impacted stocks that were directly affected by the actions of certain hedge funds. Private investors deserve to know Wall Street and hedge funds are not engaged in malicious behavior when the pendulum swings in favor of private investors, not corporate cronies. Congress has a moral and legal obligation to ensure our financial institutions act appropriately and ensure the playing field is reasonably accessible for Wall Street and Main Street.""

1/28/21 16:22,Taking action on health care,"￼

Dear Neighbor,
 
As our community continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic, we’re all thinking about the best ways to keep our families safe and healthy. At the top of that list is ensuring our loved ones have access to the health care they need and deserve. 
 
That’s why I’m excited to share with you that, today, President Biden signed two executive actions that will begin to restore and strengthen Americans’ access to quality, affordable health care. First, President Biden has directed the Department of Health and Human Services to open a special enrollment period for Marketplace coverage from February 15th to May 15th on Healthcare.gov. 
 
It is critical that we do all we can to expand health coverage to those in need during this pandemic. Additionally, this executive order instructed federal agencies to consider additional measures to strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
 
Importantly, the President’s second executive action will rescind the global gag rule, also known as the Mexico City Policy, which bars international non-profits that provide abortion counseling or referrals from receiving U.S. funding. First imposed by the Reagan administration, the global gag rule prohibits the U.S. Agency for International Development from providing grants to organizations delivering critical health and family planning services to some of the poorest women in the world if such services included pro-choice advocacy, referrals, or coverage. It is a dangerously flawed policy at any time, but especially in the middle of a global pandemic when we should be supporting and partnering with any reputable international health group fighting to curb the spread of COVID-19, regardless of the family planning services they provide. 
 
President Obama rescinded the global gag rule, only for President Trump to bring it back and expand its reach. Now, for the good of Americans and people around the globe, President Biden has done away with it again. But Congress must take action on this front as well. That’s why I have been proud to cosponsor the Global HER Act, which would prevent future administrations from reinstating the rule again. 
 
After four long years of attempts to repeal the ACA and rip health care away from millions, the Biden Administration’s decisive actions aimed at increasing and improving coverage will save lives. I am committed to partnering with the President to reduce health care costs, address growing health care needs and inequities created by the pandemic, protect access to comprehensive reproductive health care, and make our health care system easier to navigate and more equitable.
 
Better days are ahead.
 
Please continue to take care of yourselves and each other, and remember that my office is here to help. Be sure to visit the COVID-19 page on my website for more information and resources. If you have any questions or concerns, or if you need assistance, please don't hesitate to call us at (703) 256-3071.

1/28/21 15:52,January Updates from DC and the District,"￼ 
  

Good afternoon. I would like to provide a few updates about recent developments in Congress and share some important information.
Welcoming the Biden Administration
I welcome the Biden Administration and look forward to working with the President to address COVID-19, economic relief, health care, climate change, and much more.
I applaud the actions President Biden has already taken in the short time he has been in office. That includes his executive actions to deliver COVID relief, the extension of the eviction and foreclosure moratorium, the pause on student loan repayments, rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, and the repeal of the Muslim ban, just to name a few.
I am hopeful about all we can accomplish in the 117th Congress, along with the President, to ensure that all Americans achieve a dignified and prosperous life for themselves and their families.
Updates in the District
As the Administration works to expand production and distribution of the COVID vaccine, our goal should be ensuring that every American receives it as soon as possible in order to save lives and bring an end to the pandemic. Please refer to these important links regarding vaccine distribution:
When is my turn?
California Vaccine Dashboard
Santa Clara County Vaccine Dashboard
Alameda County Vaccine Dashboard
Federal casework has been the primary focus of my district staff for the first few weeks of the new year. We processed 170 requests, ranging from immigration to distribution of stimulus checks, since January 1st.
Also, I hosted Episode 2 of our Series on Race on Facebook Live. This episode featured Dr. Clayborne Carson, director of the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford University. Dr. Carson has also managed the Martin Luther King Papers Project since 1985. I was honored to host Dr. Carson as a special guest to celebrate Dr. King’s life and teachings.
Promoting Peace and Diplomacy
One of the last acts of the outgoing Trump Administration was designating the Houthis rebels in Yemen as a terrorist organization. I believe that decision was reckless and only further imperils hope for a peaceful solution to the conflict. Millions of Yemenis are on the brink of starvation. We cannot afford to exacerbate the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.
That is why I joined with some of my colleagues in the Congressional Progressive Caucus to formally denounce the Houthis’ designation as terrorists. We advanced a War Powers Resolution in the House and Senate in 2019 to bring an end to U.S. participation in the Saudi-led war in Yemen. Now, we call on the Biden Administration to reverse the designation and remove all obstacles preventing the Yemeni people from accessing food, medicine, fuel and other necessary goods and services. We are committed to reasserting Congress’s rightful constitutional authority over war and peace and support a UN-brokered peace negotiation.
Facebook Live Town Halls
Thank you to all who participated in this month’s Facebook Live town halls. In February, I will host Facebook Live town halls on February 22nd, noon Pacific. Please be sure to follow me on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram @RepRoKhanna.
Best,

The U.S. Government Needs to Invest in Digital Design
In my latest Op-Ed, I argue that our failure to invest in information technology has severely limited COVID-19 response. That’s why the country needs a new federal officer in charge of the America’s digital experience—a chief experience officer of the United States. Investing in better digital infrastructure is the most efficient and cost-effective way to improve the delivery of government services to the American people.

1/28/21 14:56,ICYMI: Sen. Rick Scott Proposes First Bills of 117th Congress,"￼ 
￼￼￼￼ 
In Case You Missed It!
U.S. Sen. Rick Scott Proposes First Bills of 117th Congress
￼
Earlier this week, Senator Rick Scott outlined a number of his priorities for the 117th Congress, which include re-filing several of his bills to reform Washington, protect Floridians and their businesses against the threat of Communist China, and hold dangerous dictators in Latin America who threaten the security of Florida and the United States accountable.  Senator Rick Scott said, “Two years ago, I began my service in the U.S. Senate determined to make Washington work better for Florida families. We’ve made some great progress, but as we all look forward to the 117th Congress, I want to make one thing very clear – I am absolutely focused on fighting for Florida and getting things done that actually help families and businesses succeed and live their dreams in our great nation. Surely, this won’t be easy. In the short time that I’ve served so far in the U.S. Senate I’ve learned that too much of the focus in Washington is on politics, not people. It’s time for that to change.  ""I’m starting the 117th Congress strong by proposing real solutions to reform Washington, protect our environment and national security, and hold dictators in Communist China, Venezuela and around the globe accountable. I truly hope that the Biden Administration and my Democratic colleagues will join me in these efforts. I look forward to continuing my work on behalf of all Floridians and getting real results that make our state and nation stronger, more successful, and more accountable to the people."" 
Read more HERE and in Spanish HERE. 
￼
Senator Rick Scott will begin the 117th Congress by filing the below legislation: 
ENSURING FREE AND FAIR ELECTIONS  The Verifiable, Orderly, & Timely Election Results (VOTER) Act:  Senator Scott’s Verifiable, Orderly, & Timely Election Results (VOTER) Act would address the inconsistencies in voting systems across the country, mandate Voter ID in every state, institute measures to ensure timely results and create uniform national standards for voting by mail.
MAKING WASHINGTON WORK FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES  Make Washington Work Plan: As part of his Making Washington Work plan, Senator Scott is fighting for reforms to require a supermajority to raise taxes or fees, establish term limits for members of Congress and institute a line-item veto for the federal budget. Senator Scott is also leading efforts to eliminate automatic pay raises for members of Congress.

My Appointment to the Select Subcommittee On The Coronavirus Crisis
Earlier this week, I was appointed to serve on the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis. This Subcommittee was created last year to provide oversight of the federal government’s pandemic response and modeled after a similar committee then Senator Harry Truman led during the Second War to oversee mobilization efforts. In my role on the Subcommittee, I will work to ensure the effective and transparent use of taxpayer funds for COVID-19 relief programs and to address the shortcomings of the vaccine rollout process. This pandemic has led to a global public health crisis as well as an economic crisis, and I will use my time serving on the Subcommittee to provide relief to the families in our community on both fronts.
Service Academy Nomination Celebration
One of the duties of a member of Congress is to nominate candidates for appointment to four of the U.S. service academies: the U.S. Military Academy, the U.S. Naval Academy, the U.S. Air Force Academy, and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy. This year, I had the opportunity to nominate 13 outstanding students from the district. These young people have decided to dedicate their education and the beginning of their careers to the security of our country. I was honored to be able to spend time with these students on Wednesday at our virtual Service Academy Nomination Celebration, and I commend them for their desire to serve.

From our virtual Service Academy Nomination Celebration
Reintroduction of the STOP Bullying Act
Today, I reintroduced the bipartisan STOP Bullying Act alongside Congresswoman Jenniffer González-Colón (R-PR). This legislation will address bullying faced by LGBTQ students and those of all backgrounds by establishing a federal grant program for schools to create anti-bullying task forces, comprised of teachers, school administrators, parents, students, child psychologists, and representatives from supporting organizations to combat the problem. This type of anti-bullying task force has been modeled on the success of existing programs in thirteen states and the District of Columbia.

Matt's Weekly Memo
 
  
Dear Lindsey,  
On Tuesday, I visited Scranton Primary Health Center to thank Scranton police and firefighters as over 60 of them received their second doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.
  
  
￼
￼
  
These frontline heroes never stopped reporting for duty since the start of this pandemic to protect us. They braved the risk of COVID-19 to keep us safe. For that, we owe them a debt of gratitude.
  
 
Big News for NEPA from the Appropriations Committee
 
  
This week, I was elected to serve as Chairman for the powerful Appropriations subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science.
 
I have always viewed bringing our fair share of federal investments back to this area as one of the most impactful things I can do as a U.S. Representative, and this leadership role will help expand Northeastern Pennsylvania’s share.
 
In this position, I look forward to directing money to help our small businesses recover from the pandemic, bring home new jobs, and expand opportunities for local companies to do business with the federal government. These are challenging times, but Northeastern Pennsylvania has great potential for growth, and I am optimistic about our future.
  
 
$122 Million for NEPA Schools
 
  
On Friday, my team and I announced over $122 million in coronavirus relief funding for more than 30 school districts in Northeastern Pennsylvania. 
 
For almost a year, COVID-19 has disrupted our children’s education. Schools are fighting to provide their students with uninterrupted and high-quality education in these challenging times. Our COVID-19 response needs to protect young Americans and the educators and staff who support them. We can not let our children fall behind because of this pandemic.
 
This federal funding will help schools create safe and productive learning environments for our kids, because we know that there is no substitute for in-person learning -- especially in the early years of a child's life.
  
 
FYI: Vaccine Production & Distribution 
 
  
This national COVID-19 vaccination campaign is unlike any effort we have ever undertaken, but we are finally mobilizing the federal government behind a comprehensive plan to change the course of this pandemic. 
 
Here's how the federal government is working to get more shots in arms faster:

View Email in Browser 
￼ 

Dear Friend,
The most important part of my job in Congress is hearing from Arkansans about the issues that matter to them.
On Tuesday night, I hosted a conference call to take your questions and discuss your concerns about the issues facing you and your family.
If you were unable to tune in, watch the full event by clicking HERE or on the image below.  
￼
 Here are some of the questions from last night: 
Where can I get the COVID-19 vaccine, and what about the new strains? 
As of January 18th, Arkansas is in Phase 1-B of COVID-19 vaccine distribution.  This includes seniors ages 70 and older, those who work in education, and those in Phase 1-A who have not received their vaccinations.  Click HERE for the full COVID-19 Vaccination Plan from the Arkansas Department of Health. 
I hope that all Arkansans will get the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to you.  
In the meantime, please protect yourself and your family by practice social distancing, wearing a mask, and washing your hands frequently. 
Will there be another COVID-19 relief package?
The president is calling for another $1.9 billion, but I believe we should not rush into another bill before the $900 billion relief bill passed in December has been rolled out and had the chance to help Americans.  That includes additional vaccines to get more Americans vaccinated.  It also includes an extension of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which I fully support for how it was able to help Arkansas businesses last year.
Any further relief should be targeted by industry and to those who need it the most. 
Should the United States rejoin the World Health Organization (WHO)? 
The United States withdrew from the WHO last year because it appeared that the WHO helped China cover up its role in the spread of COVID-19 and to call attention to the lack of accountability and independence at the WHO and its initial response to the pandemic. It was not meant to undermine the good work that the organization does for public health.
I am calling on President Biden to call attention to China’s manipulation of the WHO and hold the Chinese Communist Party and those at the WHO accountable for the delayed response to the pandemic.  Should President Biden increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour?
I do not support increasing the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour because labor markets are a local concern and should not be federally mandated.  Additionally, increased minimum wages have been shown to lead to higher prices, job losses and reduced hours, lower overall wages.  Finally, Arkansas voters spoke and Arkansas is phasing in a new minimum wage – decision that was made at the local level with input from local businesses and citizens.
Are our elections secure? 
Americans deserve to have full confidence in the integrity and security of our elections. Due to the pandemic, our election system was under unprecedented strain. I share Arkansans’ concerns about the hasty adoption of mail-in ballot systems and lack of adherence to voter ID laws.  
I support creating a bipartisan commission to review the November election results, assess procedures, identify irregularities, and make recommendations to the states for reform. I disagree with those who would give the federal government more control over our election system. The Framers specifically gave that power to the states in our Constitution, and I pledged an oath to the Constitution.

It is an honor to serve as your voice in Congress. If you have any additional questions or need assistance with a matter before the federal government, please contact my office at Hill.House.Gov or call my Little Rock office at (501) 324-5941.

Sincerely,

Melanie Lawhorn (Crapo)
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
January 27, 2021
Risch and Crapo: A Return to Obama WOTUS Rule Would Impede States’ Rights, Hurt Farmers and Ranchers 
WASHINGTON – U.S. Senators Jim Risch and Mike Crapo (both R-Idaho) joined Senator Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) to introduce a Senate resolution affirming the need to uphold the Trump administration’s Navigable Waters Protection rule, which replaced the misguided Obama-era Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule that gave the federal government unprecedented power over Idaho’s land and water.    “The 2015 WOTUS rule subjecting temporary puddles to the same federal regulation as navigable waterways was demonstrably bad policymaking and an egregious overstep by the federal government,” said Risch. “The 2020 Navigable Waters Protection rule signaled a return to common sense. It would be senseless to vacate it.”   “For years, I have pushed back against extreme levels of federal overreach, including the Obama-Biden WOTUS rule,” said Crapo. “The Obama-era WOTUS rule was nothing short of a federal government power grab and seizure of state’s rights and private property rights of individuals. The Supreme Court has already spoken to make clear that ‘navigable’ waters can be regulated, and the Trump Administration formulated a rule that fits within those guidelines. Momentary puddles, ditches and groundwater are not navigable, and the federal government should stay out of decisions best made by state and local on-the-ground experts for effective and environmentally-sound water quality management policies.”   “When the Obama-Biden administration attempted to regulate nearly 97% of the land in Iowa with their WOTUS rule, I fought back and stood up for the livelihoods of hardworking Americans. We won that fight; a new, more flexible WOTUS rule was put in place. Now, the Biden Administration is working at a rapid pace to undo this work,” said Ernst. “Everyone should agree that clean water should be a national priority. But I can’t stand by and allow for another Washington power grab that will make it harder for Iowans to farm, ranch, and build. I’m urging my colleagues to join me in standing up for workers, farmers, manufacturers, and businesses.”   Additional cosponsors of the resolution include Senators Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), Ben Sasse (R-Neb.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), John Hoeven (R-N.D.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), John Barasso (R-Wyo.), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), John Boozman (R-Ark.), Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-Miss.), Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.), and Ron Johnson (R-Wis.).
 Background:   In 2015, the Obama administration finalized a rule that defined all bodies of water, including ephemeral streams created by rainfall, as subject to federal government regulation. This created significant confusion and burdensome red tape for Idaho’s agriculture industry and many others. The Idaho Delegation had been a key proponent of a rewrite of the rule to more responsibly reflect the role of state and local jurisdictions.   The Trump administration proposed a rule to replace the Obama administration’s 2015 WOTUS rule with a new rule that provided much-needed predictability and certainty for farmers by establishing clear and reasonable definitions of what qualifies as a “water of the United States.” The new Navigable Waters Protection Rule was  finalized last year.   On day one of his administration, President Biden signed an executive order that would roll back the Trump administration’s executive order which began the process of rescinding Obama’s WOTUS rule. That’s why Risch and Crapo joined this resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that the Navigable Waters Protection rule should not be withdrawn or vacated.

PRESS RELEASE
For Immediate Release
January 27, 2021


Representative Adriano Espaillat Commends the Biden Climate Change Proposal 

Urges Greater Focus on Environment Justice and Impact to Minority Communities


NEW YORK, NY - Today, Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) released the following statement in support of executive orders announced today by President Biden to address the climate crisis. A fact sheet from the White House is here.

“Today's executive actions set the groundwork for combating both the impact and alleviating the root causes of this unprecedented climate crisis while creating jobs, building infrastructure, and delivering on Democrats' promises of ensuring environmental justice for the future of our nation and the world,” said Rep. Espaillat. “Momentous problems require bold solutions and we have a moral obligation to combat climate change in ways to ensure the mission of environmental justice is always upheld. By working to address these crises with much-needed leadership, President Biden is working to create good-paying union jobs, an equitable clean energy future, sustainable infrastructure, and a return to science and fact-based policy making.

“With these executive actions, President Biden is taking yet another momentous step to fulfill his promise to the American people, and I look forward to working with the President and this administration to ensure we build back better and stronger than before and that all communities are included in our efforts to address the climate crisis along this path forward,"" stated Espaillat.

Today’s Executive Order takes bold steps to combat the climate crisis both at home and throughout the world. In signing this Executive Order, President Biden has directed his Administration to:
 
* Center the Climate Crisis in U.S. Foreign Policy and National Security Considerations 

* Take a Whole-of-Government Approach to the Climate Crisis

* Leverage the Federal Government’s Footprint and Buying Power to Lead by Example 

* Rebuild Our Infrastructure for a Sustainable Economy 

* Advance Conservation, Agriculture, and Reforestation 

* Revitalize Energy Communities 

* Secure Environmental Justice and Spur Economic Opportunity 

Rep. Espaillat is recognized for his strong record of fighting for environmental justice and has remained committed to his work as an environmental champion who recognizes the public health impacts of climate change. Last year, the House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis unveiled a comprehensive congressional climate action framework highlighting legislation introduced by Rep. Espaillat as important tools in the effort to solve the climate crisis.

Rep. Espaillat’s Green Climate Fund Authorization Act of 2019 commits the United States to provide climate financing to keep the planet under 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming and promotes environmental justice and human rights.

Representative Espaillat is the first Dominican American to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives and his congressional district includes Harlem, East Harlem, West Harlem, Hamilton Heights, Washington Heights, Inwood, Marble Hill and the north-west Bronx. First elected to Congress in 2016, Representative Espaillat is serving his third term in Congress.

Insta a un mayor enfoque en la justicia ambiental y el impacto en las comunidades minoritarias

 NEW YORK, NY – Hoy, el congresista Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) emitió la siguiente declaración en apoyo a las órdenes ejecutivas anunciadas hoy por el presidente Biden para abordar la crisis climática. Una hoja informativa de la Casa Blanca puede leerse aquí.  ""Las acciones ejecutivas de hoy sientan las bases para combatir tanto el impacto como para aliviar las causas fundamentales de esta crisis climática sin precedentes, al tiempo que crean empleos, construyen infraestructura y cumplen las promesas de los demócratas de garantizar la justicia ambiental para el futuro de nuestra nación y del mundo"", dijo el Rep. Espaillat. “Problemas trascendentales requieren soluciones audaces y tenemos la obligación moral de combatir el cambio climático de manera que se garantice que siempre se cumpla la misión de mantener la justicia ambiental. Al trabajar para combatir estas crisis con el liderazgo necesario, el presidente Biden está trabajando para crear empleos bien remunerados protegidos por sindicatos, un futuro de energía limpia y equitativa, infraestructura sostenible y un retorno a la ciencia y la elaboración de políticas basadas en hechos”.  “Con estas acciones ejecutivas, el presidente Biden está dando otro paso trascendental para cumplir su promesa al pueblo estadounidense, y espero trabajar con el presidente y esta administración para asegurar que reconstruyamos mejor y más fuerte que antes y que todas las comunidades estén incluidas en nuestros esfuerzos para abordar la crisis climática a lo largo del camino"", indicó Espaillat.  La Orden Ejecutiva de hoy toma medidas audaces para combatir la crisis climática tanto en el país como en todo el mundo. Al firmar esta Orden Ejecutiva, el presidente Biden ha ordenado a su Administración que: 
* Centre la crisis climática en las consideraciones de política exterior y seguridad nacional de EE.UU.  * Adopte un enfoque de todo el gobierno ante la crisis climática  * Potencie el impacto y el poder adquisitivo del Gobierno Federal para liderar con el ejemplo  * Reconstruya nuestra infraestructura para una economía sostenible  * Avance en la conservación, agricultura y reforestación  * Revitalice las comunidades de energía  * Asegure la justicia ambiental y estimule las oportunidades económicas  El Rep. Espaillat es reconocido por su sólido historial de lucha por la justicia ambiental y se ha mantenido comprometido con su trabajo como defensor ambiental que reconoce los impactos del cambio climático en la salud pública. El año pasado, el Comité Selecto de la Cámara sobre la Crisis Climática dio a conocer un marco integral de acción sobre el cambio climático del Congreso, destacando la legislación presentada por el Rep. Espaillat como herramientas importantes en el esfuerzo por resolver la crisis climática.  La Ley de Autorización del Fondo Verde para el Clima del Rep. Espaillat de 2019 compromete a los Estados Unidos a proporcionar financiamiento climático para mantener el planeta por debajo de 1,5 grados Celsius de calentamiento global y promueve la justicia ambiental y los derechos humanos.

1/27/21 15:37,Baldwin Helps Introduce Bill Raising Minimum Wage to $15,"

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
Today, Senator Baldwin helped introduce legislation raising the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2025. 
“Wisconsin’s economy is strongest when we expand opportunity for everyone. Unfortunately, many frontline workers are really struggling to get by during this economic crisis and an honest day’s work should pay more,” said Senator Baldwin. “The growing gap between those at the top and everybody else has been at historic highs in recent years. The absence of upward mobility for hard working families demands action and it is past time to raise the minimum wage.” 
The Raise the Wage Act of 2021, led by Senators Bernie Sanders (I-VT) and Patty Murray (D-WA), would increase the federal minimum wage to $15 in five steps over the next four years. Beginning in 2026, the federal minimum wage would be indexed to median wage growth.    According to an independent analysis conducted by the Economic Policy Institute, the Raise the Wage Act would increase wages for nearly 32 million Americans, including roughly a third of all Black workers and a quarter of all Latino workers.  Read more about Senator Baldwin’s Raise the Wage Act of 2021 here.

Dear ,
I invite you to join me and Congresswoman Deborah Ross (NC-02) for a COVID-19 Relief Virtual Town Hall, on Thursday, January 28 from 5:30-6:30 p.m.   We will discuss the provisions included in the most recent COVID-19 federal relief package passed in December, including support for small businesses, enhanced weekly federal unemployment insurance, $600 direct checks, new federal rental assistance funds, additional resources for vaccine distribution, and more. We also will discuss President Biden’s COVID-19 relief proposal: the American Rescue Plan. There will also be an opportunity for us to directly answer your questions and share available resources.
Sign up for the COVID-19 Relief Virtual Town Hall
After months of harmful delay by congressional Republicans, Congress passed a bipartisan COVID-19 relief package at the end of December.  Despite my strong preference for a more robust package, I voted for this agreement because the needs were simply too urgent and too immense to do nothing or to wait any longer.  Unfortunately, we are many months from returning to ‘normal’, and Congress must begin working with the Biden administration on additional relief packages to ensure a full recovery occurs as soon as possible. 
COVID-19 cases are increasing rapidly in North Carolina and around the country. We all must take serious precautions to slow the spread. While it is encouraging that two safe and effective vaccines have been approved, we still have a long recovery ahead of us. This virtual town hall will allow us to provide an overview of federal COVID-19 relief efforts and directly answer your questions.
Please confirm your attendance in advance by registering here. If you are unable to join the virtual event, you can watch the discussion live on my Facebook page.  
We look forward to seeing you on Thursday, January 28th.
Sincerely, 
￼

Don’t Mess with the New WOTUS Rule 
When the Obama-Biden administration attempted to regulate nearly 97% of the land in Iowa with their Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule, I fought back and stood up for the livelihoods of hardworking Americans. We won that fight, and a new, more flexible WOTUS rule was put in place.    Now, the Biden Administration is working at a rapid pace to undo this work. 
￼ 
Click here or on the image above to read more. 
As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee and the Environment and Public Works Committee, I’m calling on my colleagues to join me in standing with our workers, farmers, manufacturers, and businesses by upholding the Trump Administration’s WOTUS rule.   Everyone should agree that clean water should be a national priority. But I can’t stand by and allow for another Washington power grab that will make it harder for Iowans to farm, ranch, and build.    As the daughter of a farmer, and an unwavering advocate for Iowa’s agriculture community, I will never stop fighting to defend the livelihoods of those who are feeding and fueling our world.

U.S. Sen. Rick Scott Fights for Floridians During the 116th Congress
￼
Over the last two years, Senator Rick Scott has worked to represent the great State of Florida and make Washington work better for Florida families by championing issues important to our state. He has fought to rein in Washington’s out-of-control spending, enhance national security, advocate for freedom and democracy in Latin American and around the world, support America’s veterans, police officers and first responders, and protect Florida’s natural resources. 
Senator Scott will continue to work every day on behalf of Floridians to ensure Florida and America remain the best place in the world to live, work and raise a family, while remaining the world’s leading example of freedom, prosperity and opportunity. 
Learn more about Senator Rick Scott’s efforts to serve Floridians in the U.S. Senate below.
￼
Sen. Rick Scott: America is the Greatest Country in the History of the World; We Need to Fight to Keep it That Way 
Senator Rick Scott delivered his maiden speech on the Senate Floor to share his personal story and his vision for America.   Watch Senator Scott’s speech here or below.  
￼
  
 
During the 116th Congress, U.S. Senator Rick Scott fought hard for the priorities that matter most to Floridians, including: 
Promoting freedom and democracy in Latin America. Senator Scott fought to include a provision in the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), signed into law in 2019, which holds Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro accountable by prohibiting the Department of Defense from doing business with anyone that supports the oppressive Maduro regime.   
Senator Scott also successfully pushed the Trump Administration to reinstate Cuba to the State Sponsors of Terrorism list and fully implement Title III of the Libertad Act to allow American citizens to sue for property stolen by the Cuban regime. 
￼
___ 
Supporting our veterans. Senator Scott is a proud co-sponsor of the Military Widow’s Tax Elimination Act of 2019, which was signed into law as part the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), allowing military spouses nationwide to receive full survivor benefits from the Department of Defense and Veteran Affairs. 
￼
___ 
Fighting against Communist China’s oppression. The Senate took a stand against Communist China and unanimously passed Senator Scott’s resolution calling on Americans to buy products made in the U.S. whenever possible to support American jobs and manufacturing, and help build up the U.S. supply chain. Senator Scott co-sponsored the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which was signed by President Trump and gives the U.S. more authority to re-evaluate Beijing’s influence on Hong Kong. He also joined his colleagues in introducing a bill that became law that prohibits the commercial export of covered munitions items to the Hong Kong Police Force. With Senator Scott’s support, the Senate also passed the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020 to impose sanctions on Chinese officials over human rights abuses against Muslim minorities. 
￼ 
___
Safeguarding seniors. With Senator Scott’s support, the TRACED Act, which shields Floridians, especially seniors, from abusive robocalls, was signed into law in 2019. 
￼
___ 
Standing with our ally Israel and fighting against Anti-Semitism. Senator Scott worked with his colleagues to pass the Strengthening America’s Security in the Middle East Act and the Eastern Mediterranean Security and Energy Partnership Act, which became law, to reinforce important alliances abroad and support Israel. 
The Senate also passed the Never Again Education Act  to support Holocaust education across the country by bolstering the educational resources at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. 
￼
___ 
Protecting our men and women in uniform. Senator Scott’s Secure U.S. Bases Act, which was passed and became law as part of the 2021 NDAA, reforms and improves foreign military student training programs following the terrorist attack at Naval Air Station Pensacola on December 6th, 2019. The 2021 NDAA also includes $740.5 billion in defense spending and a 3% pay raise for our troops.  
￼
___ 
Supporting Florida’s law enforcement. The Supporting and Treating Officers In Crisis Act was signed into law to provide law enforcement family-support services and establish suicide-prevention programs and mental health services for law enforcement officers. 
Senator Scott also joined his colleagues in introducing the Safeguarding America’s First Responders Act, to ensure families of public safety officers lost to COVID-19 can quickly access survivor benefits. 
￼ 
___ 
Preserving Florida’s Natural Resources. Senator Scott worked with President Trump to include $250 million for Everglades Restoration in his Fiscal Year 2021 budget requests to Congress. This funding builds on the $200 million in construction funding for the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Senator Scott fought for and secured last year. As Governor of Florida, Senator Scott secured a commitment from the Trump Administration to keep oil drilling off Florida’s coasts, and will continue fighting to make sure offshore drilling is off the table for Florida.

￼
Dear Lindsey,
I'm heading into another busy week working on behalf of Montanans in the Senate, and I want to update you on some of the bipartisan bills I have introduced over the last few days.  Each of these bills were crafted with input from across the political spectrum to update critical rural infrastructure, increase access to care for the folks who served our country, and hold Russia accountable.

Russia Sanctions Review Act
Russian President Vladimir Putin must be held accountable for cyberattacks against the United States, but I am concerned that this administration will eliminate the sanctions that we have placed on Russia for their aggressive actions. I believe that no President should have authority to single-handedly roll back bipartisan sanctions against Russia, and my bill will ensure that any debate to ease sanctions on Russia will be done transparently and not behind closed doors.  
Veterans Choice Program Improvement Act
I am sponsoring a bill with Senator John McCain to fix the Veterans Choice Program so veterans in rural areas can access care closer to home without long wait times. My bill will cut red tape for the VA and providers, allow the VA to be the primary payer, and increase the VA's ability to share medical records with local community health care providers.   
Rural Community Clean Water Technical Assistance Act
This infrastructure bill will ensure folks in rural communities have reliable access to clean water.  By making sure rural drinking and wastewater systems have the resources they need to keep their operations up-to-date, we can protect access to water and save taxpayers money.

All three of these bills will be moving through the Senate in the coming weeks, and I will continue to work with Republicans, Democrats, and Independents to do what's best for Montana.   Keep a close eye on my Facebook page this week for updates on a bill that I am putting the final touches that will increase public access to public lands for the folks who love to hunt, hike, and fish.   As always, it is an honor to represent you in the U.S. Senate.

Congressional Report
 
 
Dear Friend,
President Biden, his administration, and I went straight to work after the inauguration. Since January 20th, we've seen the President announce his COVID-19 national strategy as well as sign Executive Actions to address economic, immigration and border wall issues. 
 
 
 
One of the more significant updates from President Biden’s executive order is the announcement that all border wall construction activities must be paused by today- January 27, 2021.  This a promising step in our work to halt construction and undo the damage that borderlands have experienced these past four years. However, our work continues. I remain steadfast in my commitment to working with the new administration until every border wall contract is terminated and all construction crews leave our border communities.
 
I want to remind everyone that we must remain diligent in protecting ourselves and our l0ved-ones during this pandemic. Remember to wear a mask and maintain social distance until we are able to vaccinate all of our communities. 
 
As always, if you need help with a federal agency, please reach out to one of my offices.

This pandemic has taken a toll on all of us, both mentally and physically. I know many may be tired or anxious to get back to your normal way of life, but it's important that we don't let our guard down. If we want to crush the virus, we must continue to vaccinate communities, wear a mask, practice social distancing, and stay home when feeling ill. 
 
 
In this week's video the Texas Department of State Health Services explains what 'pandemic fatigue' is and why taking care of your mental and emotional well-being is just as critical as taking care of your physical well-being.

Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) applauded the opening of a COVID-19 vaccine clinic in Monongalia County. At full capacity, the clinic will be able to vaccinate 8,000 West Virginians a day, six days a week once additional doses become available.  ""West Virginia’s vaccine distribution program is one of the best in the nation and I am incredibly proud to see the Mountain State leading by example. The new vaccine clinic in Monongalia County is another great step for our vaccination program in West Virginia and I applaud Mon Health System, WVU Health System and the Monongalia County Health Department for working together to make this a reality. Right now, our highest priority must be ensuring that every West Virginian and American who wants a vaccine can get one. I will continue to work with the Biden Administration as well as state and local officials to get more vaccines to West Virginians as they become available.""   Last week, Senator Manchin spoke with General Gus Perna, Chief Operating Officer of Operation Warp Speed on COVID-19 vaccine procurement and distribution about the need for additional vaccines in West Virginia. He received assurances that the Biden Administration is ramping up manufacturing and expects to see an increase in distribution to every state in early February.

January 24, 2021
 

Dear Neighbor, 

Four years ago, I condemned the actions of many of my Democratic colleagues who boycotted the inauguration of President Trump. I believed then, as I do now, that we have a duty to respect the office of the Presidency despite any political or policy differences we may hold. Our responsibility is to present a unified front during a peaceful transfer of power, and to display an unwavering commitment to the ideals upon which our country was founded.

﻿While President Biden offered words of unity, the actions he has taken since being sworn into office have not lived up to his calls for us to find common ground, which is extremely disappointing. For example, the Biden Administration's actions last week to stop the Keystone pipeline, rejoin the Paris Climate agreement, appease the World Health Organization and stop the removal of those who have entered this country illegally are bad public policy decisions that will only further divide our country. Instead, if he is serious about unity, he should be working in a bipartisan manner to help businesses reopen and to ensure every American who wants a vaccine has access to one. Another unifying measure he could pursue would be to set up a non-partisan electoral commission to ensure the integrity of future elections. All Americans should have confidence when casting their ballots. 

Our nation is facing many immediate challenges, and we need to work together to tackle those issues.  My constituents can be assured that I will continue to defend conservative principles as I work hard to restore our way of life, rebuild our economy, and renew the American dream. 

Please continue reading for some important information.  

Getting Seniors Vaccinated

Last week, I spent several hours on the phone with Members of Florida’s Congressional Delegation and the state leaders who oversee the COVID-19 vaccine distribution process. While I do not have jurisdiction over this process, I did share all the feedback I have received from constituents over the past few weeks and made suggestions for improvements. For example, I am a firm believer that seniors should be able to create an account to register their desire for the vaccine and then be sent an invitation to receive their dose when it is available- rather than having to log on to a website each time a small group of doses become available. The current approach only causes frustration and confusion among many people who already struggle with technology. The state leaders seemed open to implementing this suggestion in the future.

Also, while Florida has received roughly the same amount of doses as other large states (approximately 2 million), our state has gotten far fewer vaccine doses than it needs to provide access to all seniors and those with underlying medical conditions who want the vaccine. Our Congressional delegation committed to working together in a bipartisan manner to advocate for more vaccine to be shipped to Florida. My hope is that we will see significant progress in the coming weeks, as two new vaccines are expected to be approved and production of the two existing vaccines should ramp up even further.

Additionally, the Florida Department of Health has also released this new vaccine tracking tool to share public information on each distribution site throughout the state. 

Local Updates

The Pasco County Health Department has a new way to pre-register for COVID-19 vaccine. Register so you are ready when new appointment slots open. I am told new slots for this coming week will be released today at 2:00 p.m. The county will only be accepting registered patients with an appointment at all vaccine locations, and at this time slots are reserved for seniors over the age of 65.   

Pinellas County is also using a new registration system for vaccine distribution and expects to receive more doses next week. Click here to learn more. 

In Hillsborough County, a new drive-thru vaccination site for seniors and frontline health care workers opened at University Mall, 2200 E. Fowler Ave. in Tampa. The vaccination site is expected to operate seven days a week based on vaccine supply. Appointments are mandatory. No walk-ups will be accepted. Priority for appointments is being given to those individuals ages 65 and older who previously created an account to schedule a vaccination at one of the county’s other sites, but who were unable to secure a reservation. These people are being directly contacted by the state-contracted appointment call center to determine if they would like to be vaccinated at the University Mall location. For more information on how to register, please visit the Hillsborough County Health Department. 
 

Protecting Consumers

Last week, I was named the Lead Republican on the Consumer Protection and Commerce (CPC) Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The jurisdiction of this important subcommittee includes: consumer protection, interstate and foreign commerce, data security, privacy matters, product safety and liability, motor vehicle safety and the regulation of commercial activity including: sports-related matters, travel, tourism, and time.

In this new leadership role, I will work to protect all Americans from predatory scams, investigate potential social media monopolies, encourage and spur innovation of emerging technologies, and defend against security breaches involving sensitive consumer data. This position also provides a unique opportunity to help the travel and tourism industry - which is vital to Florida’s economy and job market - as it seeks to fully rebound from the global pandemic. As always, my constituents can be assured that I will remain focused on ensuring quality and affordable healthcare options for all Americans and that I will never stop advocating for our nation’s heroes, as well as seniors and the disabled. I look forward to working with my colleagues on these important priorities.
 
 

Fighting for and Honoring Our Heroes

I was glad to see last week’s Executive Order by President Trump which acknowledged the toxic conditions our heroes faced while stationed at K2. This action can help pave the way for these Veterans to access the benefits and care they deserve, which is something I have and will continue to fight for in Congress. 
 

Last week marked the 30th Anniversary of Operation Desert Storm. More than 2.2 million U.S. service members served during this era, with 694,550 deployed to the Gulf. There were 299 U.S. military casualties, and many survivors returned home suffering from undiagnosed illnesses, now commonly known as Gulf War Syndrome. As with Veterans of all theaters, I salute the service and sacrifice of the brave men and women who served as part of this mission. I remain committed to ensuring our Gulf War Veterans and Veterans of all eras receive the care and benefits they deserve.
 

Heroes take on many forms. Throughout this pandemic, the tireless efforts of our healthcare workers have been nothing short of heroic. I am glad to see the NFL honoring their service by inviting them to participate in this year's Super Bowl festivities in Tampa. Hopefully, they will be able to cheer on the hometown team! Go Bucs! 
 
 

Providing Relief to Small Businesses

The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) is now re-opened for small businesses to apply for a first round of funding (up to $10 million). Small Businesses that experienced significant financial loss during the pandemic can also now apply for a second loan (up to $2 million). Small Business Owners can apply for these funds through any participating lender. Visit SBA.gov to learn more. 

The Florida Community Loan Fund (FCLF) is also pleased to provide access to PPP loans to Florida nonprofit organizations and small businesses.

• Its PPP focus is on nonprofit organizations based in Florida.
• Small businesses can also access PPP through FCLF’s network.
• You do not need to be an existing FCLF borrower to apply.
• There is no minimum loan size – FCLF wants all eligible PPP borrowers to have access.

FCLF staff is on hand and ready to answer questions about the program and coach applicants through the process. Click here to learn more. 
 
 

Constituent Corner

I recently received this message from a constituent who is also a Veteran.

Just wanted to drop you a note to say thanks for the help with dealing with DFAS. After hitting dead-end after dead-end and the worst customer support I've ever seen, I may see a solution coming. I've been trying to resolve a military retired pay division problem for over a year. The frustration was unbelievable. 

Within a week of asking for Congressman  Bilirakis's office for help I received a call from an attorney at DFAS. She was very polite and above all very helpful!. It's a shame retirees can't get that kind of support without asking for Congressional help. I'm very thankful your team takes constituent services seriously. Keep up the great work and fight the good fight. 
\

This is just one example of the work we do each day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!

Sincerely,
 

Gus Bilirakis

Unity?

There are certainly a number of policy issues that could gain bipartisan support and help the American people. However, the Biden Administration has so far been more interested in partisan actions that undo much of the great progress our country has made. 

Already in the first week we have seen executive actions that attack the U.S. energy industry, thousands of migrants streaming toward the southern border, emboldened communist China fly nuclear capable bombers over Taiwan, and ISIS claim responsibility for bombings.

These one-sided policies will not unite our country or empower the American people and serve to weaken our standing in the world. Our priorities should be recovering from the coronavirus pandemic and finding ways to empower people to safely return to work, school, church, and community life. As our new term in Congress begins, I will continue to work toward real solutions for the American people.
￼

The U.S. Must Oppose the Chinese Communist Party's Oppression

For years, China has been conducting a brutal campaign of oppression against ethnic Uyghers, a religious minority within the country. Now, it is widely known that China has been using forced sterilizations and abortions to restrict family size among the Uyghurs. These human rights abuses indicate that the Chinese government is intentionally working to wipe out Uyghur families while at the same time encouraging violence against women.

Last year, I supported a bill that Congress passed called the Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act, which President Trump then signed into law. The Act imposes sanctions on the Chinese officials responsible for the internment of more than 1 million Uyghurs and other minorities. 

The Trump Administration officially labeled China’s campaign against the Uyghurs as genocide. You can read more about that HERE. 

Last week, nominee for Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, referred to the treatment of the Uyghurs as genocide in a hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. This is a step in the right direction. The Biden Administration should hold the Chinese Communist Party to account and the world must know that the United States will not stand on the sidelines of this issue.

Day One of the Biden Administration: Attack on American Energy
￼
￼
￼
￼
On day one of his administration, President Biden moved to dismantle American energy independence and cut jobs. First, he revoked the Keystone XL pipeline permit, a project supported by President Trump and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. This pipeline would transport Canadian crude oil from Alberta to Texas Gulf Coast refiners. The Biden Administration didn’t hesitate to upend this $8 billion project, destroying thousands of existing jobs, which takes away paychecks from American families. The new administration also didn’t even lend an ear to our ally, Canada. 

Second, President Biden rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement. President Obama unilaterally entered the U.S. into this agreement without seeking ratification from the Senate or even conducting an analysis on how much the U.S.’s contribution would cost American taxpayers. One report indicates that participation in the Paris Climate Agreement would reduce U.S. GDP by $3 trillion and cost us 6.5 million jobs. When Democrats introduced legislation that would prohibit President Trump from withdrawing, I offered an amendment that would have required the federal government to conduct a cost estimate for our participation in the Paris Climate Agreement. 

I cosponsored Rep. Chip Roy’s bill that would prohibit federal funds from being used to re-enter the Paris Agreement. The U.S. shouldn’t be bound to a costly agreement that other countries, like China, are failing to adhere to. 

Finally, the Biden Administration issued an order that would halt oil and gas permits on federal lands for 60 days. Roughly 22% of total U.S. oil production and 12% of natural gas production occurred on federal lands in 2019. This move poses a significant threat to the oil and gas industry and reverses the progress made in the previous Administration on energy independence. 

The Biden Administration’s first steps signal a difficult next four years. I will continue to oppose policies like these that threaten American jobs and reverse U.S. energy independence.

Holocaust Remembrance Day
￼
￼
￼
￼
January 27th marks the anniversary of the release of the prisoners from Auschwitz – the concentration camp that was responsible for killing over a million Jewish people. In one of the darkest times in history, over six million Jewish mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, and friends were murdered for their heritage, political affiliation, and defiance of the Nazi Regime.
 
There are countless stories from men and women who survived the Holocaust telling the harrowing details of the evils that occurred – forced labor, malnourishment, medical experimentation, and gas chambers to name a few. We must never forget what happened during the Holocaust and continue working as a nation and as a world to ensure it never happens again.
￼

In Other News:

	•	Aransas County, in cooperation with Del Mar College and the Aransas County Partnership Economic Development Corporation, is the recipient of a $1.7 million U.S. Department of Commerce Economic Development Administration grant. The award will assist Aransas County in acquiring and renovating an existing building that will house a workforce development and entrepreneurship center. Aransas County has come a long way since Hurricane Harvey and continued recovery depends on economic development and rebuilding. I was pleased to write a letter of support for this grant last year, as it will bring important workforce training to our district while stimulating private investment.  I look forward to the resulting economic growth in the region. 

	•	CORRECTION: Last week's newsletter incorrectly dated the anniversary of the Supreme Court decision Roe v. Wade as January 25th. It is January 22nd.

1/26/21 17:45,Congresswoman Diana Harshbarger Announces Committee Assignments,"
￼
￼
￼

Dear fellow East Tennesseans,

I wanted to share with you all the news of my committee assignments for the 117th Congress, announced today. I'm honored to serve on the House Education & Labor and Homeland Security Committees. Read my full statement below:

Congresswoman Diana Harshbarger Announces Committee Assignments

Kingsport, TN- Congresswoman Diana Harshbarger released the following statement today regarding her selection to the House Committee on Education and Labor and the House Committee on Homeland Security. 

“I’m honored to have been selected to serve on the Education and Labor and Homeland Security committees in the 117th Congress,” said Congresswoman Harshbarger. “As a member of the House Committee on Education and Labor, I will always put students first. Our students deserve not just a great education, but also the right education to address their unique learning needs. I also look forward to working on common-sense solutions to better align workforce development programs, including apprenticeships, to address the skill requirements for the in-demand, high-paying jobs of the 21st century economy.”

Republican Leader of the House Committee on Education and Labor Virginia Foxx added, “As a pharmacist, Rep. Harshbarger’s experience and knowledge will be substantial in many areas that fall under the Education and Labor Committee’s jurisdiction. I am eager to work together during the 117th Congress to continue the great work of her predecessor, Dr. Phil Roe, as we foster the best opportunities for students to learn, workers to succeed, and job creators to thrive.”

Congresswoman Harshbarger continued, “Being appointed to the coveted Homeland Security Committee gives me, and East Tennessee, a voice in the debate on how to address the many evolving threats to our national security from malicious and sophisticated adversaries. Our nation must be protected from acts of terrorism, cyber-attacks, and any other threats to our homeland. This includes continuing recent efforts to secure our borders. We see the ill effects of an unsecured border here in Tennessee, even though we are hundreds of miles away from the closest international border. The opioid epidemic has devastated families aided by illicit drugs crossing our porous borders, and MS-13 gang violence has unfortunately become a feature in some of our communities. I look forward to finding solutions to these critical issues with my colleagues on the committee.”

Sincerely,
￼

1/26/21 17:29,Congressman Jake LaTurner Stands Up For Life,"


For Immediate Release | January 26, 2021

Contact: Pat Adams | Pat.Adams@mail.house.gov

Congressman Jake LaTurner Stands Up For Life

Read Congressman LaTurner's latest op-ed on his commitment to the pro-life agenda:

January 22 marked the 48th anniversary of the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision. Now more than ever, America must continue to unapologetically stand for the sanctity of all human life. As the representative of Kansas’ Second Congressional District, my constituents can be assured that I will always protect pro-life values at home and in Washington. I promised that I would be a fearless pro-life advocate throughout my public service, and I will keep my word to those who elected me. 

In Kansas, I am proud to put my full support behind the “Value Them Both Amendment” that is before the Kansas Legislature. Currently, there is a legal basis for an unrestricted, unlimited abortion access in Kansas due to the Hodes & Nauser v. Schmidt decision handed down by our liberal Kansas Supreme Court. The Value Them Both Amendment will allow for commonsense regulation on the abortion industry that protects babies and mothers. Thankfully, significant progress is already being achieved with the Value Them Both Amendment recently passing the Kansas House of Representatives and looking very likely to pass the Kansas Senate any day now. Once that vote takes place, the voters of Kansas will have the final say during a statewide election in 2022, where I am confident Kansans will choose life. 

In Congress, I have already taken bold actions to advance pro-life policies. After being sworn in, I immediately joined the Congressional Pro-Life Caucus, with the primary objective of preserving the sanctity of life. From there, I intend to co-sponsor significant, commonsense pro-life bills that protect the unborn. I will co-sponsor the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which prohibits any person from performing an abortion on an unborn child who is 20 weeks or older. Additionally, I will co-sponsor the Defund Planned Parenthood Act, a bill that prohibits Planned Parenthood from accessing any federal mandatory or discretionary funds for one year. The bill also reallocates more nearly $250 million to other community health centers that do not perform abortions.

Despite all of this, we are already beginning to see the drastic consequences of the 2020 presidential election for the pro-life community. President Joe Biden is wasting no time to advance his radical pro-abortion agenda. The Biden administration announced that they intend to revoke the Mexico City Policy, which bans United States taxpayer funding to foreign organizations that provide abortions. President Biden and his Democrat counterparts will shamefully send Americans’ hard-earned money to other countries with the intention of funding abortions – this is deeply wrong and sends a horrible message about our values to the rest of the world.

Unfortunately, it does not end there. President Biden also proudly campaigned on ending the Hyde Amendment, a bipartisan, pro-life public policy that has been in place for more than four decades that restricts federal funding for abortions. If you didn’t know, President Biden had previously opposed taxpayer-funded abortion for nearly 50 years, until he decided to run for president and abandon his conviction on the issue. I pray that President Biden will appeal to his better angels and return to a commonsense support of the Hyde Amendment, especially if he truly wants to unite our country. Forcing American taxpayers to subsidize unrestricted, unlimited abortions will only further our divisions and isolate our fellow Americans. 
 
We must reaffirm our commitment to defending the most vulnerable lives among us – the unborn. Pro-life Americans will not rest until innocent human life is protected from the abortion industry. Life will win.

 Thought of the day: “Be kind to unkind people; they need it the most!”
Coronavirus Update

On Monday, Michigan reported 3,011 new cases of COVID-19 and 35 new deaths, bringing the state’s total cases to 551,000 and deaths to 14,326.
Vaccines are continuing to be delivered to states. On Monday, Michigan reported 1,476,775 COVID vaccines have been distributed and, of that, 730,453 doses have been administered. Michigan continues to prioritize vaccinations for at-risk populations, including frontline workers and those 65 and older. For more information on Michigan’s vaccine eligibility requirements, visit Michigan’s COVID-19 vaccine information page.
At least three mutated variants of COVID-19 have been discovered, originating in South Africa, Brazil, and the UK. One of these variants, B.1.1.7, has been discovered in Michigan, including in Wayne and Washtenaw counties. The UK variant is approximately 1.5 times more transmissible than other known strains of COVID. As of now, this variant does not appear to cause more severe sickness than the other known strains.
With the discovery of these new variants, President Joe Biden acted quickly to restrict travel, barring most non-citizens from entering the US from the UK, Ireland, Brazil, and the Schengen area of Europe. Additionally, President Biden will add restrictions for most travelers from South Africa, beginning January 30, 2021.
COVID vaccine manufacturers, Moderna and Pfizer, have said their vaccines are effective against the UK variant that has appeared in Michigan. However, Moderna has said their research shows its vaccine may not be as effective against the South African COVID variant. The manufacturer has begun testing to see if a third booster shot will help improve their vaccine’s efficacy against the South African variant.
With this new, more transmissible variant discovered in Michigan, it’s more important than ever for Michiganders to commit to masking up, keeping their physical distance, and washing their hands regularly. If you have been exposed to someone, or if you have recently traveled, it is important to get tested.
Vaccines are offering us hope to finally crush COVID and build back our economy. But we have to continue following CDC guidelines—even those who have received one of the FDA approved vaccines should continue to mask up. The first dose of either vaccine only offers a small degree of protection from COVID infection, a vaccine’s stated efficacy isn’t achieved until both doses have been administered.
President Biden is working hard to vaccinate more Americans, setting a goal of vaccinating over 1 million Americans per day. President Biden has said he strongly believes we will have enough vaccines for anyone wanting one by the Spring. To do this, he will use the Defense Production Act, something the last administration refused to do, to focus resources on increasing production and distribution of these life-saving vaccines. President Biden has also finally given us a national plan for crushing COVID, something we have needed for almost a year.
The public-private partnership that brought two vaccines to the market was great, but the previous administration failed to set up a structure for distributing the vaccines efficiently once they were ready. Instead, the previous administration left all of the work to states and then refused to provide state and local governments with funding to build the infrastructure needed to distribute the vaccine. The previous administration’s lack of planning caused so much confusion in the distribution and administration of vaccines and slowed the vaccine’s rollout. The Biden Administration is correcting the previous administration’s mistakes by working with state and local governments to speed up vaccinations and save lives. 
 Legislative Update
Work is beginning in the House on the next COVID relief package, laid out by the Biden-Harris Administration. Families and small businesses are struggling—additional action is not a choice, but a requirement. We must do our job in Congress to pass a relief package that meets the needs of struggling Americans, including investing more in vaccine distribution, more help for small businesses, and survival checks for individuals and families.
We have a lot of work ahead to address the many issues impacting the lives of Americans, including raising wages for frontline workers, providing support to struggling small businesses, delivering direct payments to Americans, and much much more.
Yesterday, House Impeachment Managers delivered the article of impeachment against the former president for inciting a violent insurrection that left five people dead, including a US Capitol Police officer. Today, the U.S. Senate will be sworn-in as judges and jurors for the trial that is scheduled to start in early February.
It’s important for the unity of our country and preservation of our democracy to hold those responsible for the attack on January 6th accountable for their actions, and at moments, lack thereof. Trump’s rhetoric and actions on January 6th violated his oath of office by inciting a seditious riot at the US Capitol. Donald Trump must be convicted in the Senate and barred from ever holding public office again.
COVID-19 Vaccine Information
Michigan is busy at work distributing and administering COVID vaccines.  More information on vaccinations can be found by visiting https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98178_103214---,00.html.

MI-12 COVID Testing Sites
The State of Michigan has launched a statewide COVID testing site locator. This tool will help Michiganders search for cost-free testing sites near them. If you or someone you know may have been exposed to COVID, it is important you get tested.  
￼

Additional COVID testing sites are announced regularly and this list may not be exhaustive. 

ACCESS Community Health and Research Center (6450 Maple Street, Dearborn) offers free mobile COVID testing every Tuesday, from 1-5 p.m. Tests will be given on a first-come-first-serve basis, though you may pre-register by texting “UPG Cares” to 48355.

The 2|42 Community Church in Ann Arbor (648 S. Wagner Road, Ann Arbor) is offering contactless drive-thru only saliva testing. Testing is available at this site Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m., and on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3 to 7 p.m. Pre-registration is required for this testing site. Those needing to be tested should pre-register here: lynxdx.health/register

Bergman, 200 Republicans Oppose Weakening of Longstanding Pro-Life Protections

Washington -Today, Rep. Jack Bergman joined RSC Chairman Jim Banks and 198 Republican colleagues in sending a letter to Congressional leaders pledging to oppose any government funding bill that eliminates or weakens the Hyde Amendment or other current-law, pro-life appropriations provisions.

The Hyde Amendment, which bans taxpayer-funded abortions, has garnered bipartisan support from every President since Jimmy Carter. This longstanding policy is now on the chopping block by Congressional Democrats and President Biden, who flipped his long-held position last June and now favors repeal of the policy.  
""Fighting to defend the Hyde amendment and other pro-life provisions has been paramount to First District constituents for decades. Democrat and Republican Representatives from our District have consistently found common-ground when it comes fighting for the lives of the unborn, and I'm proud to continue this fight for those who have no voice,"" said Rep. Jack Bergman.
Chairman of the RSC Jim Banks said: “Despite decades of consensus on this issue, radical Democrats have signaled they no longer have an interest in protecting the conscience rights of millions of Americans who do not want their hard-earned money used to pay for abortions. My colleagues and I demand congressional leaders protect the ban on taxpayer-funded abortions and save the Hyde Amendment.”

Dear Neighbor,
Small businesses are the backbone of our community and our economy. Both during the pandemic and in traditional times, opportunities arise for businesses to access assistance through private and government resources. When these opportunities become available, a common question we hear from small business owners is, ""What do I need to apply?""
A free virtual workshop we are hosting on Tuesday February 2, 2021 with experts from SUNY Buffalo State College’s Small Business Development Center will help answer that question. The event, targeted to small businesses, will provide tips and information to help attendees be ready when funding becomes available.
￼
The workshop will be led by the SUNY Buffalo State College Small Business Development Center with a presentation by Ms. Marilyn Roach, an Advanced Certified New York State Business Advisor.

About Tim

Legislative Work



Dear friend,    Welcome back to my Week in Review newsletter. You can sign up for my weekly updates and other issue-specific newsletters here. Please remember to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube for regular updates on how I am serving the people of South Carolina!     Standing up for South Carolina    My number one priority is always to do what is best for the people of South Carolina. Unfortunately, some of the actions taken by the new administration risk harming the Palmetto State’s workers, job creators, and economy more broadly. In a Senate Finance Committee hearing last Tuesday, I asked President Biden’s nominee for Treasury Secretary, Dr. Janet Yellen, how raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour would affect the millions of small businesses around America that are on the brink of closing. I was disappointed in her answer. She failed to mention the 3.7 million jobs that the Congressional Budget Office estimates would be lost after enacting this change.    On President Biden’s first day, he issued an Executive Order to cancel the Keystone Pipeline. This decision will hurt the middle class, raise our energy costs, challenge our relationship with Canada, and cost us thousands of jobs in rural America. It is not too late to reconsider and I hope that he will do so before more damage is done.    You can always count on me to fight to protect small businesses and rural workers from these damaging policies.   FEED Act   Last Friday, I reintroduced my bipartisan FEED Act. If enacted, this bill would allow the federal government to cover the costs for states and localities to partner with restaurants and non-profits to provide nutritious meals to vulnerable populations across the country. In the face of the pandemic, this legislation could provide a critical tool for addressing food insecurity and nutritional access gaps, particularly for seniors and children from underserved communities. The FEED Act would also help small farms and restaurants stay afloat during these uncertain times by facilitating partnerships between food producers, restaurants, and non-profits. I am grateful to José Andrés and his team at World Central Kitchen for their continued support of this commonsense, life-changing legislation.   Heroes, Our National Guard    On Thursday, I visited with the members of the South Carolina National Guard stationed in DC to protect the Capitol during the inauguration. I thanked them for keeping us safe and for their commitment to country. Our troops deserve the utmost respect for defending our democracy. That’s why I was dismayed by the unsafe and unconscionable decision to put our troops outside in a parking garage last week. After several Members of Congress and I spoke out, the guardsmen were moved inside. I was glad to learn that they’d be safe and warm indoors, but those who made the initial decision should be held accountable.

Sincerely,

January 2021 Squeal Award: Ernst Tells Washington: Justify This!   Why Is Washington Asking For More Of Your Paycheck When It Can’t Even Spend What It Already Takes? 
The federal government ends every fiscal year with a mountain of unspent money. The total for last year added up to more than $800 billion! And 2021 is expected to be nearly the same, with all of that taxpayer cash sitting idle and for no purpose.    Meanwhile, these same federal agencies that cannot find ways to spend all the money they’ve been given will once again come to Congress, hat in hand, asking for budget increases. The fiscal insanity cycle continues.    If these agencies already know they’re not going to spend all the money they’re given, why the heck are they asking for more? That’s a darn good question and certainly one Iowa taxpayers deserve to have answered.    As for the money that is being spent, let’s take a closer look and ask a few more questions:  
	•	Why did the EPA pay $1.5 million for unused parking spaces?
	•	Why were tens of thousands of dollars sunk into an underwater sculpture garden, nearly 60 feet beneath the surface of the Gulf of Mexico that will be visited by more fish than people?
	•	Why was more than half-a-million dollars used in part to support a study to determine if chimpanzees recognized themselves in a mirror?  
Folks, it’s just bananas to monkey around with money like this when our country has so many other urgent needs—and taxpayers certainly deserve to know what was behind spending decisions like these.   Agencies submit budget justifications to Congress as part the President’s annual budget request, and while the documents don’t answer all of these questions, they do give greater insights into how bureaucrats are managing your money. But in typical Washington practice, these budget justifications are only available to a select few, and not YOU the taxpayer…who actually pays the bills. 
￼ 
That is why I am awarding my January 2021 Squeal Award to the Office of Management and Budget for keeping these documents hidden from the public.    It is also why I am supporting the bipartisan Congressional Budget Justification Transparency Act, which would require the budget justifications of every federal agency to be posted online for the public to make their own decisions about whether or not Washington’s spending decisions are justifiable.   Why is Washington asking for more of your paycheck when it can’t even spend what it already takes? 

Do you have an example of government waste or inefficiencies that I should take a look at? Send me an email by clicking here. 
Thank you!

My Thoughts on President Biden's Inauguration

Joe Biden is now our Nation’s president and Kamala Harris is our vice president. I wish them success, for when they succeed, our Nation succeeds. My family and I will be praying for them. It was an honor to be able to witness the peaceful transition of power for the second time of my tenure in Congress.
 
I stand ready to work with President Biden and Vice President Harris to find bipartisan agreement on solutions to the critical issues facing American families. At the same time, I won’t hesitate to oppose President Biden, his Administration, and the Democratic-controlled Congress and hold them accountable for their party’s liberal impulses. 

Our Nation faces many problems. Now is the time for all of us to come together and govern in a bipartisan way. That is how we will begin to heal our divisions and move our country forward.

SBA announces reopening of the Paycheck Protection Program for new and certain existing PPP borrowers

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), in consultation with the Treasury Department, announced that the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) has re-opened this week for new borrowers and certain existing PPP borrowers. 

Key PPP updates include:
	•	PPP borrowers can set their PPP loan’s covered period to be any length between 8 and 24 weeks to best meet their business needs;
	•	PPP loans will cover additional expenses, including operations expenditures, property damage costs, supplier costs, and worker protection expenditures;
	•	The Program’s eligibility is expanded to include 501(c)(6)s, housing cooperatives, direct marketing organizations, among other types of organizations;
	•	The PPP provides greater flexibility for seasonal employees;
	•	Certain existing PPP borrowers can request to modify their First Draw PPP Loan amount; and
	•	Certain existing PPP borrowers are now eligible to apply for a Second Draw PPP Loan. 

A borrower is generally eligible for a Second Draw PPP Loan if the borrower:
	•	Previously received a First Draw PPP Loan and will or has used the full amount only for authorized uses;
	•	Has no more than 300 employees; and
	•	Can demonstrate at least a 25% reduction in gross receipts between comparable quarters in 2019 and 2020.

More Important Updates

Ensuring Public Employees Receive Social Security Benefits They've Earned
￼

Earlier this month, I re-introduced the bipartisan Social Security Fairness Act (SSFA), which eliminates the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), two titles of the Social Security Act that unfairly reduce or eliminate Social Security benefits for millions of Americans who have devoted much of their careers to public service. The legislation currently has 21 bipartisan co-sponsors. In the last session of Congress, we organized a bipartisan group of 264 co-sponsors of the legislation. 

This bipartisan bill ensures that a teacher who spends his or her summers working a second job or a police officer who changes careers after years of service will not face a possible 40 percent reduction in their Social Security benefits. By repealing these outdated provisions that unfairly penalize public servants in Illinois, we can provide some certainty to retirees while helping to recruit future teachers, firefighters, and police officers.

You can find more information about the Social Security Fairness Act here. 
￼


Supporting Local Restaurants and Providing Meals to People in Need

This month, I re-introduced the bipartisan FEMA Empowering Essential Deliveries (FEED) Act. This bill allows the Federal government to pay 100 percent of the cost to states and localities so that they can partner with restaurants and nonprofits to prepare nutritious meals for vulnerable populations, such as seniors and underprivileged children. These partnerships will support businesses and small farmers as the Coronavirus pandemic continues.

If this pandemic has shown us anything, it’s that we need to be innovative in how we respond to this crisis, and that’s exactly what the FEED Act does. This bill helps support our restaurant industry, which has been hit hard during this pandemic, in a way that’s never been done before. By creating these partnerships between local governments and local restaurants, we can help get meals to people in need more quickly and help the food industry, which is a major employer and a critical part of our economy, during this difficult time.

You can find out more information about the FEED Act here.

President Biden's Keystone XL Pipeline Executive Order Will Hurt Our Local Economy
￼

Pictured above: Phillips 66's Wood River Refinery in Roxana, Madison County, Illinois

Pipelines are a safe and efficient way to transport energy, and they create good-paying jobs for communities we represent at refineries like those in Wood River. President Biden’s executive order to halt construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and other environmental policies he’s pursuing will threaten energy and union jobs in Illinois and across the country. 

﻿It’s unfortunate that on Day One of his presidency, President Biden opted to fulfill a campaign promise to left-wing environmental activists instead of supporting the American labor community and energy workers in a struggling economy. We urge the President and his Administration to pursue an all-of-the-above energy approach that protects energy and union jobs and secures low-cost energy for our constituents.

1/26/21 9:55,Espaillat and Pressley Unite to Urge Administration to Abolish the Death Penalty,"￼ 
  

PRESS RELEASE
For Immediate Release
January 26, 2021


Espaillat and Pressley Join Alliance to Abolish the Death Penalty 

In Wake of Rash Executions, 45 Members Urge Biden Administration to End the Federal Death Penalty


WASHINGTON, DC - Today, Representatives Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) and Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) sent a letter to Department of Justice Attorney General-Designate Judge Merrick B. Garland to prioritize President Biden’s commitment of working with Congress to end the federal death penalty and incentivizing states to end capital punishment across the country.

“The death penalty is unjust, immoral, and racist – we must abolish it,” said Congressman Espaillat. “After an unprecedent killing spree in which the previous administration executed 13 Americans, more in the last seven months than in the last seven decades, it is beyond time for the death penalty to become a part of American history, not America’s present. The death penalty unjustly targets Black and brown Americans, and is arbitrarily levied most against those who cannot afford adequate counsel. I look forward to working with the Biden administration to put an end to this cruel practice.""

“State-sanctioned murder is not justice, and the death penalty, which kills Black and brown people disproportionately, has absolutely no place in our society,” said Congresswoman Pressley. “Ending the federal death penalty— which is as cruel as it is ineffective in deterring crime—is a racial justice issue. It’s time to truly move our country in the direction of justice and healing. In his new role, Attorney General-nominee Garland will have the power to use the full force of the Department of Justice to stop employing the death penalty at the Federal level and prevent any more unjust executions. Following months of organizing, mobilizing and demonstrations calling for change to our criminal legal system, this moment demands that he do exactly that.”

In the letter, the 45 Members stated, ""The death penalty is a stain on the United States’ commitment to advancing justice and human rights. After the past year of Americans taking to the streets to protest police brutality and racial injustice, we believe abolishing the death penalty would be an important marker as we work to address systemic racism in America, particularly within our criminal justice system. We ask that upon confirmation you partner with Congress to enact legislation to end the federal death penalty and resentence those currently on federal death row.""

Espaillat and Pressley have pushed to abolish the federal death penalty since the 116th Congress and with their recent joint efforts, the Members of Congress encourage the Biden administration to: 

• Work with Congress to enact legislation to abolish the federal death penalty and resentence those currently on federal death row;
• Rescind the July 25, 2019, addendum to the Federal Execution Protocol and withdraw any pending death warrants;
• Withdraw authorization for all pending death penalty trial cases and cease to seek any death sentence;
• Direct the Bureau of Prisons to dismantle the federal death chamber at FCC Terre Haute prison;
• Rescind DOJ Rule 85 FR 75846 “Manner of Federal Executions” that took effect December 24, 2020. The rule would give the Attorney General unfettered ability to deviate from the regulations at will without subjecting any such changes to further review, and grant unlimited power to redelegate authority and reassign duties among various DOJ components in direct contravention of 18 USC 3596(a). The rule would also eliminate the requirement that any execution be preceded by a valid judgment and order from the federal sentencing court, thereby eliminating a federal court’s authority to control its own judgments and violating the separation of powers between the judicial and executive branches.

Espaillat y Pressley se unen a una alianza para abolir la pena de muerte

A raíz de ejecuciones precipitadas, 45 miembros instan a la administración Biden a poner fin a la pena de muerte federal


WASHINGTON, DC – Hoy, los congresistas Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) y Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) enviaron una carta al juez designado a fiscal general del Departamento de Justicia, Merrick B. Garland, para que le dé prioridad al compromiso del presidente Biden de trabajar con el Congreso para poner fin a la pena de muerte federal e incentivar a los estados a poner fin a la pena capital en todo el país.

“La pena de muerte es injusta, inmoral y racista; debemos abolirla”, dijo el Rep. Espaillat. “Después de una ola de ejecuciones sin precedentes en la que la administración anterior ejecutó a 13 estadounidenses, más en los últimos siete meses que en las últimas siete décadas, ya es hora de que la pena de muerte pase a ser parte de la historia estadounidense, no del presente de los Estados Unidos. La pena de muerte injustamente tiene como blanco a los estadounidenses negros y de las minorías, y se aplica de manera arbitraria principalmente a quienes no pueden pagar un asesoramiento legal adecuado. Espero trabajar con la Administración Biden para poner fin a esta cruel práctica”.

“El asesinato autorizado por el Estado no es justicia, y la pena de muerte, que mata a personas negras y de las minorías de manera desproporcionada, no tiene ningún lugar en nuestra sociedad”, dijo la congresista Pressley. “Poner fin a la pena de muerte federal, que es tan cruel como ineficaz para disuadir el crimen, es una cuestión de justicia racial. Es hora de mover verdaderamente a nuestro país en la dirección de la justicia y la curación. En su nuevo cargo, el nominado a fiscal general Garland tendrá el poder de utilizar toda la fuerza del Departamento de Justicia para dejar de aplicar la pena de muerte a nivel federal y prevenir más ejecuciones injustas. Después de meses de organización, movilizaciones y manifestaciones demandando un cambio en nuestro sistema legal penal, este momento exige que se haga exactamente eso”.

En la carta, los 45 miembros declararon: ""La pena de muerte es una mancha en el compromiso de los Estados Unidos de impulsar la justicia y los derechos humanos. Luego de que el año pasado los estadounidenses tomaron las calles para protestar contra la brutalidad policial y la injusticia racial, creemos que abolir la pena de muerte sería un marcador importante a medida que trabajamos para abordar el racismo sistémico en los Estados Unidos, particularmente dentro de nuestro sistema de justicia penal"".

Espaillat y Pressley han presionado para abolir la pena de muerte federal desde el Congreso 116 ° y con sus recientes esfuerzos conjuntos, los miembros del Congreso animan a la administración Biden a:

• Trabajar con el Congreso para promulgar leyes para abolir la pena de muerte federal y volver a sentenciar a los que actualmente se encuentran en el corredor de la muerte federal;
• Rescindir el anexo del 25 de julio de 2019 al Protocolo Federal de Ejecución y retirar cualquier orden de ejecución pendiente;
• Retirar la autorización para todos los juicios pendientes de pena de muerte y dejar de solicitar la pena de muerte;
• Ordenar a la Oficina de Prisiones que desmantele la cámara federal de muerte en la prisión FCC Terre Haute;
• Rescindir la Regla 85 FR 75846 del DOJ “Modo de Ejecuciones Federales” que entró en vigor el 24 de diciembre de 2020. La regla le daría al fiscal general la capacidad ilimitada de desviarse de las regulaciones a voluntad sin someter dichos cambios a una revisión adicional, y le otorgaría poder ilimitado para volver a delegar autoridad y reasignar deberes entre varios componentes del DOJ en contravención directa de la 18 USC 3596(a). La regla también eliminaría el requisito de que cualquier ejecución sea precedida por una sentencia y orden válidas del tribunal federal de sentencia, eliminando así la autoridad de un tribunal federal para controlar sus propias sentencias y violando la separación de poderes entre las ramas judicial y ejecutiva.

Kansas Common Sense  January 25, 2021
Hello,  Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them. 
  
Meeting with Kansans Regarding COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution   
Visiting a Vaccination Clinic  This week, I received a briefing from The University of Kansas Health System and toured their vaccination clinic to see how they have readied their facility in order to best serve patients and medical staff. I heard more from hospital personnel about how I can aid Kansas at the federal level in its vaccination rollout and make certain vaccine dissemination to the general public is done in a more effective manner. Currently, Kansas ranks 36th in population and ranks 36th in number of Pfizer vaccines received. Kansas also has approximately 0.874% of the U.S. population and has received 0.838% of the vaccines. As Kansas moves forward with vaccinations, we discussed the need for better communication between federal, state and local entities, as well as greater transparency surrounding the amount of doses hospitals and counties will receive each week.   I was impressed with the way The University of Kansas Heath System continues adapt to the evolving logistics involved in ordering, receiving and preparing the COVID-19 vaccine for Kansans. Thank you to The University of Kansas Health System President & CEO Bob Page, Director of the Center for Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension Dr. Tim Williamson, KU School of Medicine Interim Executive Vice Chancellor Dr. Steve Stites, Government and Community Affairs Vice President Kenny Wilk, Chief Operating and Nursing Officer Tammy Peterman and Assistant Chief Nursing Officer Kim Dixon for your hard work to vaccinate Kansans. 
  
￼ 
  
Discussing Vaccine Distribution with Ellis County Leaders  I met with leaders from Ellis County in Hays this week to discuss vaccine rollout and the next steps as COVID-19 vaccines continue to be more widely administered across the state. While Ellis County leaders told me of their decision to move vaccinations to a single location in order to most effectively administer the vaccine, they also informed me of the challenges they face as a rural community receiving the vaccine.   Thank you to Ellis County Commissioner Neal Younger, Ellis County Health Service Director Jason Kennedy, First Care Clinic CEO Brian Brady, Ellis County Emergency Manager Darin Myers, HaysMed President Eddie Herrman and First Care Clinic Medical Director Dr. Christina Fisher for your feedback and time. 
  
Attending the 59th Presidential Inauguration 
On Wednesday, January 20, I attended the 59th inauguration ceremony for President Joseph R. Biden to witness this important moment in our nation’s democracy. The inauguration represents the orderly and peaceful transfer of power that is an enduring symbol of a government of the people, by the people and for the people. I look forward to working with my Senate colleagues in this new Congress to create a better future for all Americans. 
  
￼ 
  
Thanking the Kansas National Guard 
The Kansas National Guardsmen honorably served their country these past weeks by defending our nation’s capital during the peaceful transition of power. They, and all members of the guard, deserve our deepest respect and gratitude. The decision to remove them from the U.S. Capitol last week without providing the appropriate accommodations was disgraceful and unacceptable.  While I was glad to learn that these dedicated Guardsmen were allowed back inside the Senate Office Buildings and the Capitol Complex, their removal should not have happened at all. I visited with members of the Kansas National Guard who were stationed near the Library of Congress to hear about their experience on Capitol grounds. I will work to make certain our National Guardsmen are treated respectfully during the remainder of their time in Washington, D.C.

Urging President Biden to Prioritize America’s Veterans 
As chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I urged President Biden to work with Congress on behalf of our nation’s veterans. The VA committee has made significant accomplishments for veterans over the last several years, such as allowing veterans in rural states like Kansas greater choice to seek health care where and when it is convenient for them and landmark veterans health care legislation, but there are still many challenges ahead. The VA is in the midst of the greatest transformational change since the end of World War II, and the faithful execution of the laws recently passed by Congress on behalf of veterans is what will ultimately improve the lives of veterans in Kansas and all across the country.    Caring for our nation’s veterans has always been a unifying force during my time in Congress. I expressed to President Biden that it is my hope it will continue to be so under his presidency.  To read my full letter, click here. 
  
Protecting American Jobs and Energy Independence through the Keystone XL Pipeline 
This week, I joined seven of my Senate colleagues in introducing legislation to authorize the continued construction of the Keystone XL pipeline following President Biden’s decision to revoke the cross-border operation permit. This project is expected to provide approximately 11,000 direct high-paying jobs and create up to 60,000 indirect and direct jobs, generating tax revenue, increasing renewable-energy demand, reducing emissions and strengthening North American energy independence. Construction of Keystone XL began last year, jump-started by a $1.1 billion investment. Major segments of the pipeline have already been built, including one that crosses the U.S.-Canadian border.  Canceling the Keystone XL Pipeline will cost our country thousands of jobs, raising energy prices and forcing us to become more dependent on foreign countries to supply our nation’s energy needs. At a time when our economy and communities are hurting due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we should be focusing on sending people back to work rather than taking jobs away. Despite passing every environmental impact assessment more than five years ago, Keystone XL has been politicized for almost 12 years. Discontinuing construction now is reckless for the hardworking American families relying on the jobs and lower energy costs it will provide them in the future. 
  
Calling for Senate Consideration of the Flawed Paris Climate Agreement 
Earlier this week, I sponsored a Senate resolution calling on President Biden to submit the Paris Climate Agreement to the U.S. Senate for advice and consent as required by the Constitution before joining a treaty. In 2016, President Obama entered the Paris Agreement without the consent of the Senate, going directly against the U.S. Constitution. Article II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution states that the President may only enter into an international treaty provided two-thirds of the Senators present concur.  I opposed the Obama Administration’s decision to enter into the Paris climate accord without appropriate congressional input, and again, when the Trump Administration pulled out of the accords, I reiterated that Congress must have a role in consenting to such agreements. I urge President Biden, before he rushes our country back into the flawed Paris Agreement, to submit it to the Senate for consideration in order to avoid making a consequential decision that lacks input from Congress. 
  
Thanking Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy 
This week, I thanked Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy for his service to this nation and all that he has achieved for our national defense and servicemembers throughout his tenure as Secretary of the Army. His leadership has benefitted the soldiers, Army civilians and veterans across the country who call the Army their family. He has seen our Army through unprecedented challenges, and I know our soldiers are stronger for it.  One of my most memorable experiences in the Senate was visiting 1st Infantry Division soldiers in Germany and Poland (pictured below), followed by our trip to Afghanistan to meet with troops on the front lines of the Global War on Terror. These meetings were the beginning of a productive working relationship that formed into a strong friendship. Since then, I have appreciated his guidance and support during his visits to Kansas and our many discussions in Washington, D.C. He was able to join me in Kansas in 2019 to visit Seitz Elementary School at Fort Riley where he was instrumental in finding the funding for this school during his time as Special Assistant to Defense Secretary Robert Gates in 2011. The Big Red One soldiers and their families have benefitted from his service. A fitting culmination to his service was the opportunity to lay wreaths together at Arlington National Cemetery, a solemn occasion that I will never forget.

Remembering Roe v. Wade 
For the first time since Roe v. Wade was announced in 1973, Washington D.C. will not host its annual March for Life. This event typically brings hundreds of thousands to our nation’s capital, including hundreds from Kansas, to march peacefully in protest of a decision that has enabled the elimination of more than 60 million children. Abortion rates have declined in recent years, and we must continue building on this success rather than rolling back legal protections for the unborn and their mothers, taxpayers and health care providers of conscience. I thank all who work to make their voices heard to protect the right to life for the most vulnerable of Americans. 
  
Honored to Serve You in Washington  It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.

Dear Friends, 
I was honored to attend the inauguration on Wednesday. I congratulate the 46th President of the United States, Joe Biden. From the first inauguration in 1789 that saw George Washington installed as the first American president to Wednesday’s inauguration installing the 46th, one constant remains: the peaceful transfer of power. 
It was a beautiful day on the Mall, and I was sad that Americans were unable to join us as they normally do. The ceremony was inspiring and a symbol of a new day for American democracy.
I will work with President Biden and his administration to increase opportunities for all Arkansans and Americans and to elevate those we serve. Our nation and her resolve have been tested over the past weeks, and I call on my colleagues in the Legislative Branch – Democrats and Republicans alike – to find unity in the purpose of honoring our Constitution, preserving our Republic, and calling on each of us to advance our nation for the good of all of our citizens.

HONORING MEN AND WOMEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT 

On January 6th, the United States Capitol was attacked with the purpose of disrupting the certification of the Electoral College votes. As they approached the Senate chamber, United States Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman put himself in harm’s way and steered them away from the chamber. His heroic actions saved countless lives and protected our democratic process. Officer Goodman is an example of the integrity and commitment to public service we see every day in federal, state, and local law enforcement officers across the country.
￼

RECEIVING YOUR ECONOMIC IMPACT PAYMENTS 

I am actively monitoring Internal Revenue Service (IRS) distribution of Economic Impact Payments (EIPs) to Arkansans. If you have not received your first or second round of EIP, the IRS is able to place a tracer on missing payments – but only 30 days after the date it was sent. To find out when it was sent, CLICK HERE.  
If you are eligible for an EIP but have not received one, you may be able to claim a Recovery Rebate Credit in your 2020 income tax. This is the only way to claim your first and/or second EIP. I encourage Arkansans to file their taxes as soon as possible.  
Please contact me (501) 324-5941 or Hill.House.Gov if you have received an error message at the website or if you have any other questions.  We can help. 

MEETING WITH ROTARY MEMBERS FROM LITTLE ROCK
 
On Tuesday, I was glad to join members of the Rotary Club of Little Rock to provide key updates on the U.S. Small Business Administration’s re-opening of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).  I fought in Washington to get this program restarted because it was a lifeline to Arkansas small businesses.  Now, even more small businesses can access this critical funding. We also discussed what Congress is doing in the fight against COVID-19.
I commend the hard work of President Jeff Hildebrand and the members of Club 99 as they continue their dedicated service to our community,
As a third-generation Rotarian myself, the Rotary’s motto of “Service Above Self” guides my work in Washington on behalf of central Arkansans every day.

WEEKLY RECAP
The latest news and updates from Congresswoman Beth Van Duyne

January 25, 2021

Dear Friend,

Much has changed in our country over the last week. On Wednesday, just as we have done for many generations, we witnessed the peaceful transition of power from one administration to the next. Like many of you, I was relieved to see that the inauguration remained peaceful, and I'm grateful for our brave National Guard and Capitol Police who managed such a large event with high risks.

As the 117th Congress moves into a new phase of legislating and doing the work we were elected to do, I'm committed to working with everyone and anyone – Republican, Democrat, Independent – to get things done for the people of North Texas. Our country is tired of the partisan gridlock. It's time to negotiate meaningful change for the American people.

On Wednesday, I led a number of my House Republican freshmen colleagues in sending a letter to President Biden congratulating him on the start of his presidency and pledging to work together on a number of bipartisan issues, including protecting Americans with pre-existing conditions, strengthening and modernizing infrastructure, and restoring the economy in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic.

While I was initially encouraged by President Biden's pledge to be a President for all Americans, I was disappointed that he kicked off his first few days in office by decimating thousands of jobs, hurting working families, and enacting dangerous immigration policies. Last week, I spoke to Neil Cavuto on Fox Business Network about this and more.

North Texas Small Business Tour 

During last week's district work period, I spent much of my time visiting businesses in North Texas and finding out how they are adapting to the challenges of 2021. We have hundreds of thriving small businesses across the district, and each plays a vital role in our community.

￼

It was great meeting with the President of Atmos Energy to discuss their efforts to prioritize safety and work with their customers to ensure no one is without gas during the pandemic. I appreciate their dedication to our communities, and I look forward to working with them on energy solutions.

￼

Thank you to 6 Stones for allowing me to visit their New Hope Center this week. 6 Stones serves over 300 local families each week through clothing and food assistance. Executive Director Jennifer Leney is passionate about community revitalization, and North Texas is better because of their work.

￼

I enjoyed meeting with Trinity Lakes Development and hearing about their plans for a mixed-used development in the heart of our district. We look forward to welcoming the families who make North Texas their home!
￼

Tri-County COVID-19 Vaccine Briefing Tour

We must do everything we can to open our economy back up while protecting the health and safety of our citizens, and ensuring every American who wants a vaccine can receive a vaccine is a critical component of achieving that goal.

Last Friday, I visited Tarrant, Denton and Dallas Counties to meet with local leaders and tour COVID-19 vaccination sites. Local leaders have truly risen to the challenge and set up the infrastructure needed to vaccinate thousands of people daily, and now we need to work on any delays in manufacturing and distribution.

I appreciate leaders like Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price, County Judge Andy Eads and Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson taking their time to meet with me.

To learn more about our COVID-19 vaccine briefing tour, watch NBC 5 News's coverage.

1/25/21 18:52,New round of PPP funds open for applications,"￼
January 25, 2021
Dear Friend,
I don't need to tell you the incredible challenges we face as a country and a state. You can see it - in the closed businesses, the lines at food pantries, and in the families that will now forever be without their loved ones. I have fought to support New Mexico's small business owners and nonprofits throughout this crisis. 
That includes fighting for the funding and important reforms in the Paycheck Protection Program that has served as a critical lifeline for so many business owners. I insisted that the forms be simplified, which they eventually were - from more than 11 pages of complicated forms to just 2 or 3 pages. I've fought to make sure PPP funds were distributed fairly, including to Tribally-owned businesses. Finally, I've explained why the forgiveness program had to be simplified, and now it has been. 
The next round of new PPP funds that Congress passed as part of the latest relief package in December just opened up for applications.  
>>>You can find more information about how to apply for the Paycheck Protection Program here.
This latest round will be much easier for small businesses to access, with some necessary flexibility to allow businesses to address their specific needs and still get their loans forgiven. That includes new provisions that allow restaurants, hotels, and other businesses in related services to calculate a higher PPP forgivable loan amount in order to aid industries that have been severely impacted by state and local restrictions. Also eligible for this round of PPP are housing cooperatives, local newspapers and TV and radio broadcasters, and 501(c)(6) nonprofits, including local chambers of commerce and tourism organizations.
As part of the most recent relief legislation, I also fought to pass $15 billion in new grants specifically targeted for independent arts and performance venues that have been forced to close their doors during the pandemic. Applications just opened for the Shuttered Venue Operators Grant, and I encourage all independent arts and music venues in New Mexico to apply for this emergency assistance. 
I strongly encourage any small business owners in New Mexico who may need assistance in navigating the process for PPP or any other relief programs to please contact my office. We are here to help. You can find additional information about support for small businesses during this pandemic from the New Mexico SBDC here. I want you to know that I will keep doing everything I can to resuscitate our economy and to rebuild thriving communities across New Mexico.
Sincerely,
￼

￼ 


Attending the Inauguration with the Adjutant General of Indiana 
Last week, I attended the Inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. This was the 59th Presidential Inauguration, marking the peaceful transfer of power as an essential component of the American experiment. Witnessing this uniquely American tradition once again reminded me of the immense responsibilities we have to protect this republic. I stand ready to work with the new administration to find common ground wherever possible, and to ensure every American has a fair shot at success.   I would also like to thank the Indiana National Guard members who were mobilized to our nation’s capital to help ensure a safe Inauguration, as well as their Commanding General, Brigadier General Lyles who joined the ceremony as my guest. From deployments around the globe to responding to the COVID-19 pandemic and now helping to ensure the peaceful transfer of power, the men and women of the National Guard continue to make Indiana proud.  Click here for more.

Saying Thank You to Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman
Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman exemplified immense courage and commitment to duty during the January 6th riots. He was able to divert rioters in the Capitol to help ensure the safe evacuation of many inside. I was proud to introduce legislation to award Officer Goodman the Congressional Gold Medal in honor of his heroic actions on January 6, 2021. His bravery on that day deserves recognition.
I thank him and all the Capitol Police Officers who were there that day for their service to our nation.  
￼
General Lloyd Austin’s Confirmation as Department of Defense Secretary
Our nation has an important tradition of placing civilian leaders in control of the Department of Defense. This is necessary to empower civilian voices within the military. As a Marine, I recognize the importance of protecting this long-held practice and am concerned about the precedent set by approving two waivers in a matter of just four years. For that reason, I voted against the waiver for General Lloyd Austin to serve as DoD Secretary. However, I do not question General Austin’s merits as a nominee or his commitment to our national security, so I voted in favor of his confirmation. 
Keeping the Filibuster
Last week, I voiced my opinion on keeping the filibuster. When Republicans were in power, Democrats wanted to keep the filibuster in place. In fact, 28 Democratic Senators signed this letter in support of preserving this important tradition. Now that the Senate is split 50-50, some of my Democratic colleagues have changed their minds and are in favor of a power grab. But even President Biden has warned that “ending the filibuster is a very dangerous move.""  I strongly urge Senator Chuck Schumer and my Democratic colleagues to seriously reconsider the long-term consequences of eliminating rules that would fundamentally change the way the Senate functions. What may benefit their party today, could make them powerless in the future.  Click here to read more.  
Combating Global Corruption 
Global corruption is often at the root of conflict, humanitarian suffering, and political crises. In places like Afghanistan, Yemen, and Venezuela, corruption has undermined the rule of law and stood in the way of humanitarian aid reaching those in need. My bipartisan Combating Global Corruption Act aims to stop international corruption by standing with the world’s most vulnerable and holding those in power responsible for their actions.  
Constituent Spotlight 
For the last 31 years, Tipton resident Robert Peters, has worked at the local Pizza Hut dropping off pizzas all around the city. With more the 200,000 miles on his car, the community came together and bought him a brand new car to continue serving Hoosiers.   For more on this story, click here.

Eviction Moratorium and Rent Relief
 
  
￼
  
The COVID-19 crisis has hit families hard and paying rent has become nearly impossible for millions. In the last relief bill, Congress extended the federal eviction moratorium until January 31 and approved $25 billion in rental assistance, but that's simply not enough.
 
That's why Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley and I recently led 63 of our colleagues in calling on the Biden-Harris Administration to prioritize the housing and homelessness crisis, sign an executive order to halt evictions and work with Congress to pass rent relief.
 
And while I'm pleased that President Biden extended the ban until March 31, I'm going to continue fighting to ensure my constituents have the support they need to survive this crisis.
  
 
Local Resources
 
  
￼
  
The last federal relief bill passed by Congress also included $25 billion for rent relief. As some of that money comes to Los Angeles, I'll be providing updates on these local resources.

Biden Boosts Beatty’s Bipartisan Push 
for Tubman Twenty
Congresswoman Beatty to reintroduce the Woman on the Twenty Act of 2021

U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03), Chair of the powerful Congressional Black Caucus, is introducing this week the Woman on the Twenty Act of 2021, a bipartisan bill to honor the legacy of one of America’s most historically significant female figures, Harriet Tubman, and follow through on the American people’s choice to replace President Andrew Jackson on the $20 bill. Specifically, the bill would require any $20 bill printed after 2024 to prominently feature a portrait of the famous abolitionist. Reintroduction of the bill comes on the heels of an announcement by the Biden White House today that ‘we’re exploring ways to speed up that effort.’
 “For several years, I worked directly with the Department of Treasury to plan the release of the new $20 design featuring Harriet Tubman to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment,” Beatty said. “The American people want our currency to better reflect the diversity of our great country.” She added, “I look forward to working with the Biden-Harris Administration, including the first-ever female Secretary of Treasury, Janet Yellen, to put a woman on the twenty and make the Tubman Twenty a reality.”
Beatty has fought throughout her time in Congress to secure a woman on our nation’s currency. In June 2015, she introduced the original Woman on the Twenty Act, directing the Secretary of Treasury to create a citizens’ panel to recommend a woman to be placed on a $20 bill. That same year, she spoke from the House floor in support of putting Harriet Tubman on the new $20. The following April, Beatty wrote a letter to former Secretary Lew, calling on the Department to fast track the new note and have it in circulation by 2020. Then, in 2017, Beatty wrote Mnuchin, urging him to recommit to the redesign of the twenty-dollar bill featuring Harriet Tubman. Last Congress, she took her actions a step further, authoring an updated version of the Woman on the Twenty Act expressly forbidding a new $20 to be printed without an image of Tubman, and Beatty also led a press conference, joined by a group of more than 30 Members of Congress, on the steps of the U.S. Department of Treasury to demand change. Most recently, to coincide with the Woman on the Twenty Act of 2021, she wrote an exclusive opinion piece published in The Hill calling for the production of the Tubman Twenty.
￼ Congresswoman Beatty led a national press conference on the steps of the U.S. Department of Treasury demanding the then-Trump Administration follow through on the decision to update the new $20 featuring Harriet Tubman.

1/25/21 17:13,The DeSaulnier Digest: A New Day in America,"
 
￼
￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ 

Dear Lindsey:
Last week, in a celebration of American unity and democracy, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were sworn into office. Though we face enormous crises, I am confident that under this new leadership, we can work together to provide relief for the American people and rebuild toward a more just and equitable future. I look forward to continuing this work with my Congressional colleagues alongside the Biden-Harris Administration. For more on our efforts so far, click here or on the image below.

COVID RELIEF UPDATE 
President Biden's National Strategy and Executive Actions on Coronavirus
In his first few days of office, President Biden has taken swift action in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. The President announced the National Strategy for the COVID-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness, a $1.9 trillion plan to address the pandemic and provide relief to Americans in need. While the Biden Administration and Congress work to pass that plan into law, President Biden has also taken action to ramp up the pace of PPE manufacturing and virus testing; require mask use during interstate travel; create better data collection systems; establish a health equity task force to address the needs of vulnerable populations; issue safety guidance for schools and workers; and find more treatments for the coronavirus and future pandemics.
California Stay-at-Home Order Lifted and Eviction Moratorium Extended 
On Monday, California Governor Gavin Newsom lifted the state's stay-at-home order, which means that Contra Costa will now return to the Purple tier in the state's re-opening plan. Activities like limited outdoor dining and operation of hair salons and barber shops may begin to resume. Governor Newsom also announced that California's eviction moratorium has been extended through June 30, 2021. For a detailed explanation of what the newest health order means and what services may resume, visit the Contra Costa Health Services COVID-19 page and California's COVID-19 resource page. 
IN THE NEWS 
Congressman DeSaulnier sat down with Richard French to discuss why he believes President Biden is the exact right leader for this moment & how Congress must work with the Administration to implement a federal response to the pandemic.

U.S. Sen. Rick Scott Recognizes National Florida Day
Dear Floridian, 
From Pensacola to the First Coast and all the way to Key West, it’s obvious to anyone that has spent time in Florida that our state is a very special place. Our beautiful beaches, theme parks, and natural treasures, like the Everglades, keep bringing people back to visit and often stay for good in the Sunshine State. 
This National Florida Day, I would like to recognize the best part of our state – our people. Florida is home to the world’s most welcoming, warm and culturally diverse residents. Floridians are the reason I ran for Governor, then Senate, and why I work every day to represent our state in Washington, D.C. In celebration of National Florida Day, I encourage you to enjoy Florida’s warm weather, fresh air and maybe a slice of key lime pie. 
￼
Happy National Florida Day!
Sincerely, 
￼

COVID-19 Vaccine Information 

Governor Ron DeSantis has signed Executive Order 20-315, which outlines that providers can only administer the COVID-19 shot to the following groups: 
	1.	Long-term care facility residents and staff
	2.	Healthcare workers in direct contact with COVID-19 patients, including paramedics and EMS
	3.	People age 65 and older

Miami Lakes ZIP Code Bill

Today, I reintroduced legislation in Congress that would create a unique ZIP code for Miami Lakes. For far too long, Miami Lakes residents have dealt with the negative impact of lacking a unique ZIP Code for their town. From higher insurance rates to election confusion, there are a number of reasons why a dedicated ZIP Code is necessary. For nearly a decade, I have been working alongside Mayor Manny Cid and the Town of Miami Lakes to create a unique ZIP Code for the town. Legislation that I introduced in the past three Congresses have overwhelmingly passed in the House, but unfortunately have not even been considered in the Senate. 
﻿For that reason, I am introducing similar legislation again this Congress. I will continue to work with my House and Senate colleagues to get this bill to the President’s desk and am hopeful that Mayor Cid and the town will be granted the unique ZIP Code they so desperately need.
￼

Thanking the Florida National Guard
￼
￼

Last week, I had the great honor of meeting with the Florida National Guard that has been tirelessly safeguarding our nation’s capital. 

My deepest gratitude to the heroes that keep us safe and free. 
￼

DED for Venezuelans

As one of his last decisions in office, President Trump has guaranteed that those Venezuelans who sought safety in the United States will not be returned to the dictatorship, where they could be subject to persecution, human rights abuses, or even death. This issue has always been a top priority of mine, and for the past four years, I have been working closely with President Trump and his Administration to secure this important protection for Venezuelan nationals. 
Deferred Enforced Departure (DED) differs from Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in that it derives from the president's foreign policy authority rather than through legislation passed by Congress. The chart below shows the main differences. 
Normally, an application for DED is not required— DED status is automatically granted to eligible individuals; however, at this time, USCIS has not yet provided guidance on procedures to receive this benefit or to obtain employment authorization as directed in the order.

￼

Recognizing 'The Congressional Award' Bronze Medalist
￼

It was a privilege to personally recognize Flavia Nunez for receiving The Congressional Award's Bronze Medal. 
Flavia is a student from Florida's 25th Congressional District who devoted more than 260 hours of community service to the Town of Miami Lakes. Once again, I congratulate her for setting challenging goals and meeting the needs of her community.

Re-Elected as Lead Republican on T-HUD

I'm grateful to have been re-elected by the House Republican Steering Committee to continue serving as the leading Republican on the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Appropriation Subcommittee. During my years on T-HUD, as former Chairman and now Ranking Member, I have brought millions of federal dollars to South Florida to support our veterans, the elderly, the disabled, and other vulnerable populations. I have also worked diligently to maintain and upgrade our nation’s roadways, seaports, transit systems, and airports. Further, I have successfully been able to bring these investments into our community. Whether through the first federal capital for the SMART plan, PortMiami receiving the largest grant for port infrastructure development, or helping to build the Underline, I am thankful to have been at the forefront of obtaining these funds.

Weekly Wrap-Up with 
Congressman Byron Donalds
January 25, 2021

This past week was a historic week for our nation. America celebrated Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s life, and legacy witnessed a peaceful transition of power, and began a new chapter in our nations' history book. The Biden Administration has taken many concerning first steps that do the opposite of uniting our divided country. It is deeply disappointing to see the administration taking steps to overturn the America First policies of the previous president, including: halting border wall construction, rejoining the WHO and the Paris Climate Accord, killing jobs by ending the Keystone XL pipeline, and freezing a measure to lower the cost of life-saving insulin. 
 
As outlined in the Constitution, our three branches of government's leadership will change, but our responsibility as members of the legislative branch does not. I am committed to serving in this legislative body as a conservative with unwavering beliefs in God, our Constitution, and the American Dream.    Continue reading for highlights on this past week in Congress.
 

 
 
Inauguration of President Joe Biden
 
Inauguration Day is a historic moment for our country and is a time when all of us united around our shared identity as Americans. Throughout our treasured history, we have witnessed the peaceful transition fo power as President George Washington envisioned. I feel that attendance at this historical event truly honors our great Republic.

Florida Vaccinates One Million People
 

This past week, because of Governor DeSantis' strong leadership, Florida just vaccinated its one-millionth patient in the fight against COVID-19. I am proud of Florida's continuous record of innovation and resilience. Congratulations to all of our leaders and healthcare workers that made this impressive milestone happen.

Florida Delegation Calls on Operation Warp Speed Officials to Increase State’s Vaccine Allotment
 
In Florida, we are following the science while allowing Floridians to safely go about their daily lives. We are home to millions of seniors & seasonal visitors, which creates an increased demand for vaccines. For this reason, I'm requesting to increase the vaccine allocation. Signed letter, here.
 

 
 
District Updates
 
Last week, the Southwest Florida community was honored to host Governor Ron DeSantis in the city of Cape Coral to announce all Publix grocery stores and Publix pharmacies in Lee County will begin offering COVID-19 vaccines. Throughout this pandemic, the Governor's Administration has consistently prioritized #SeniorsFirst. 
 
I'm thankful for Governor DeSantis' leadership in forming this innovative partnership!
 

 
 
In the Media
 
Unity and healing in the days ahead will require steady leadership from Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.). They must work with Republicans, not just Democrats, to put forward an inclusiveness agenda representing those in middle America, not only New York City and San Francisco.

Honoring the Life and Legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. 
 
Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in the midst of challenging & controversial times stood strong—using peace & the power of words to fight for equality for all. His movement enabled every American, including myself, access to the American Dream, regardless of race.

Anniversary of Roe v Wade
 

This past, the nation saw the 48th anniversary of Roe v Wade. I ask Americans to join me in taking a moment of silence for the more than 63M innocent lives lost since this ruling in 73'. Every life is valuable, from conception to natural death & I will fight to protect the life of every unborn child.

 Home | Newsroom | Helping Iowans | Contact 

￼ 
Joni Ernst: Don’t let the swamp strike back: Keep earmarks away from Congress   As Published In: Roll Call | January 25, 2021   I know a thing or two about pigs, and one thing is for sure — they stink.    Pork was taken off the menu (temporarily, I guess) a decade ago after years of politicians literally pigging out on taxpayer dollars, earmarking millions for special interests and their own pet projects, like that infamous bridge to nowhere in Alaska. Some even went to jail for exchanging bribes over congressional pork.   But now Congress wants to bring the bacon back to the legislative process.   The incoming House Appropriations chair wants to go back to the days where individual members of Congress rewarded their donors and supporters with billions of dollars in taxpayer money with no oversight, no competition and no reviews. Is anyone surprised that members of Congress truly believe Washington is just not swampy enough? I guess House Democrats think Congress’ 15 percent (and rapidly declining) approval rating is a bit too high.   Congressional earmarks were banned in 2011 when a significant number of reformers, from both sides of the aisle, joined together to put a halt to the madness. Unfortunately, the ban wasn’t permanent.   Many members of Congress, even those with zero private-sector or military experience, believe themselves to be perfectly qualified to evaluate innovation for Department of Defense weapon systems. My suggestion? If congressmen want to play host of “Shark Tank,” they should resign their seats and call ABC for a job.   Defense earmarks are especially harmful because they take away critical research and development funds and direct them to things that have no value to the military or will actively harm our troops. As the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities — which oversees DOD research and development spending — you better believe this is of utmost importance to me. I’ll give you just two examples.   First, due to an earmark, the Navy was forced to buy luxury speedboats they didn’t need, so they turned around and gave them to a local college. Second, the Marines were forced to buy “combat” T-shirts that would have burned their bodies if they were caught in a fire in Iraq or Afghanistan. You can’t make this stuff up. Instead of putting taxpayer money to good, important use — like researching and developing new technologies and weaponry — the largest government agency blew it.    In my short time in the Senate, Congress has never needed to go back to the individual earmark system of the past. In the last four years in particular, the U.S. military has devoted billions in funding for new innovations, including advanced technology in the realms of hypersonics, artificial intelligence, machine learning and robotics. Just recently, the Pentagon awarded federal funding to 150 different researchers at 85 universities and colleges in 33 different states. No swamp lobbyists or earmarks were needed, as it was a full, open, transparent and fair competition for funding.   I will happily work with any senator who feels that there is a good idea for our troops that the Pentagon may be ignoring. But at the same time, I will strongly oppose any National Defense Authorization Act or defense appropriations bill with earmarks in it.   There’s simply no reason to go back to the old, wasteful and detrimental ways of earmarks. We need to permanently ban this bad practice.   Sen. Joni Ernst, a combat veteran, is a Republican representing the state of Iowa.    To read the op-ed in Roll Call, click here.

1/25/21 12:35,Clyde in Congress: Inaugural Edition,"

117th Congress, 1st Session | January 25th, 2021
 


Welcome to the first edition of Clyde in Congress, a newsletter dedicated to keeping my constituents informed on the work I am doing in Congress on behalf of Georgia’s Ninth Congressional District.

It is an honor to serve as your Representative here in Washington, and I could not be more grateful for the trust and faith you have placed in me.

Rep. Clyde objects to the certification of electoral votes

Fighting to preserve the freedoms and liberties that our forefathers fought to defend has been my first priority from the moment I stepped foot in the U.S. Capitol. When Congress convened on January 6th in a joint session to count and certify electoral votes for our next President, I objected to the electoral votes from six states: Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Unfortunately, because our partner Senator from Georgia backed off her commitment to support an objection to Georgia’s slate of electors, I was unable to present my case regarding the serious concerns of election integrity in our state. 

I will always defend the right to peacefully protest, but I will never condone violence as a form of protest.
That said, Federal law affords Senators and Representatives the ability to object to the counting and certification of electoral votes and I could not in good faith vote in favor of certifying votes from certain states knowing the improprieties and irregularities which existed during the 2020 Presidential race. Specifically, the race in Georgia was plagued by repeated misconduct, including the Secretary of State of Georgia’s use of a Compromise Settlement Agreement to unilaterally alter the State’s statutory requirements, a move that violated the U.S. Constitution. 

No American—regardless of party affiliation—should have reason to question the process or the results of our elections. Unfortunately, millions of Americans did have reason to question the process and we must restore their faith in our electoral system. In response, I pledge to work with my colleagues in the Georgia Assembly and here in Congress to restore the integrity of our elections within the bounds federalism as defined in the Constitution. The American people and our Republic deserve nothing less.
 

Rep. Clyde Votes Against the Impeachment of President Trump

The rule of law and due process are two pillars that hold up the foundations of our democracy. Unfortunately, there are those in the Democratic Party who disregarded these fundamental values in an effort to score political points by impeaching President Trump. What makes this action especially reprehensible is the fact that they pursued it just days after the tragic events on Capitol Hill.

What our country needs right now is a return to the rule of law and due process. In fact, I believe it is our divergence from these values that led to the situation we find ourselves in today. Accordingly, I was proud to take to the floor of the House of Representatives on Wednesday, January 13th, 2021 to oppose the impeachment of President Donald Trump. 

This was my first speech on the House floor and was carried by many major news networks, including Fox News and PBS. During my remarks, I denounced the impeachment as a “shameful act of political retribution—retribution this President has weathered since day one.” Furthermore, I pointed out how this would be the first impeachment in U.S. history in which the House of Representatives did not hold debate on the charges filed, conduct even a single hearing, or investigate of the facts.

No evidence was presented. No witnesses testified. No cross-examination was conducted. No due process was afforded!

My friends, this wasn’t just unconstitutional, it was unamerican. Even the worst offenders in our society are guaranteed the right to due process. Our Constitution guarantees this because we are a civilized society. By pushing through this impeachment in such a hurried manner, the Democratic Party has traded the path of civility for one of barbarism in which emotion and politics override our God-given rights. This is a travesty, and I fear that it will set a dangerous precedent going forward.

Shortly after delivering my remarks, I voted against this sham impeachment. It is my sincere hope that we do not see a similar miscarriage of justice in the future.

Rep. Clyde Bill Co-Sponsorships

When I decided to run for Congress, I promised you that I would work diligently to restore the 2nd Amendment and protect the sanctity of life. Here’s a brief overview of the bills I have co-sponsored so far: 

·      Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act (H.R. 38): to allow a valid concealed carry permit to be recognized in any state that allows residents to carry concealed firearms. 

·      No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act (identical to H.R. 20 of the 116th Congress): to prevent taxpayer dollars from being allocated to fund abortion programs. 

·      Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act (identical to H.R. 296 of the 116th Congress): to prohibit Title X grant money from being given to entities that provide or support abortion programs. 

·      Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (identical to H.R. 784 of the 116th Congress): to prohibit the performance of an abortion on an unborn child 20 weeks or older, as this is when the child begins to feel pain. 

With the passing of the anniversary of Roe v. Wade and the annual March for Life ahead of us, I will be working with my colleagues to secure the right to life for the most innocent among us. I will continue to uphold the promises I made on these issues, as well as efforts to support small businesses, to reopen the economy, and provide access to reliable high speed broadband internet for our rural communities.

Featured Article: Election security is too important to cast aside post-inauguration

by Rep. Clyde

Congress has now certified the election in favor of President Biden, and former President Donald Trump has peacefully handed over power, continuing our centuries-old tradition that has existed since George Washington left office in 1797.

In the wake of the tragic events that occurred on Capitol Hill on Jan. 6, I believe it is time our nation begins a much-needed healing process. As part of the process, it is imperative that we address the irregularities and misconduct that have littered our elections for too long and that led millions of people, Republican and Democrat alike, to question the electoral process and the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.

I had the pleasure of visiting Paladin Wireless, a small Internet Service Provider (ISP) in Royston which serves 3 rural counties in Georgia. I spoke with owner Steve Fortman about rural broadband expansion initiatives for small ISP’s like Paladin.

I also visited Windstream, the largest ISP in our district, and had the opportunity to discuss the role larger ISPs play in providing broadband to our district. Ensuring our rural regions have stable and reliable high-speed internet is critical to our economic, academic, and civil progress. A solution will require input from the private and government sectors, and I look forward to playing my role going forward.

Representative Adriano Espaillat Reintroduces Transportation Alternatives Enhancements Act to Increase Funding for Pedestrian Infrastructure Projects

The Transportation Alternatives Enhancements Act Amends Existing Transportation Alternatives (TA) Program to Increase Funding for Biking and Walking Infrastructure Projects


WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) reintroduced the Transportation Alternatives Enhancements Act, which would make several improvements to the Transportation Alternatives (TA) program and fund a variety of small-scale community transportation projects to help improve pedestrian safety and access to transit, constructe bicycle facilities and infrastructure, environmental mitigation, and more. 

“I am proud to reintroduce the Transportation Alternatives Enhancements Act to help communities around the nation build better bicycling and walking infrastructure, such as trails, pedestrian and bike bridges, and various other projects that will connect and provide residents with alternative routes to travel in their local communities. I strongly believe this bill will encourage local governments to rethink the way they use transportation dollars to make their infrastructure not only more accessible, but also better for our environment and better for residents’ health. These projects will also contribute to better pedestrian and biker safety, stemming the recent, disturbing growth in fatalities,” said Rep. Adriano Espaillat (NY-13), a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the only member representing New York City, which is home to the largest transportation system in the nation.

“Investments in Washington state’s infrastructure support major modes of transportation like planes, buses and cars, but they ensure the safety of bicyclists and pedestrians, too,” said Rep. Rick Larsen (WA-02), a senior member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. “Local leaders in Bellingham and Lynnwood are already committing to more sidewalks, trails and bike lanes to better connect parts of their respective cities, particularly in underserved areas. I will continue to support efforts to ensure Northwest Washington’s communities have the resources to improve safety and equity, increase mobility and reduce traffic congestion and pollution.”

“On behalf of the millions of people in America who bike for transportation, for their health, and for fun, the League of American Bicyclists applauds the continued leadership of Reps. Espaillat and Larsen in re-introducing the Transportation Alternatives Enhancement Act,” said Bill Nesper, executive director of the League of American Bicyclists. “This bill would transform the way Americans experience our transportation system by increasing funding for projects that make biking and walking safer and more accessible, plus making critical changes to the program that will foster equity and enable more Americans to benefit from Transportation Alternatives projects. As our country faces interconnected crises, Congress can move our nation towards a sustainable recovery by passing this legislation and taking a step in building a more Bicycle Friendly America for everyone.”

""During the coronavirus pandemic, we have observed record increases in rates of people walking and bicycling – as well as increases in traffic injuries and fatalities,” said Cassandra Isidro, executive director of the Safe Routes Partnership. “It is more apparent than ever that communities both want and need to make walking and biking safe, easy, and available options for their residents. The Transportation Alternatives Program is the key source of funds for communities working to create safe, connected routes to school, retail, parks, jobs, and health care. The Safe Routes Partnership applauds Representative Espaillat for his leadership to expand and strengthen the Transportation Alternatives Program and for making the program more equitable and accessible to communities across the country. ""

Congresista Adriano Espaillat introduce Ley de Mejoras de Alternativas de Transporte para aumentar la financiación de proyectos de infraestructura peatonal

La Ley de Mejoras de Alternativas de Transporte enmendaría el programa existente de Alternativas de Transporte (TA) para aumentar los fondos para proyectos de infraestructura para circular en bicicleta y caminar


WASHINGTON, DC – Hoy, el congresista Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) anunció la introducción de la H.R. 5231, la Ley de Mejoras de Alternativas de Transporte, que haría varias mejoras al programa de Alternativas de Transporte (TA), que financia una variedad de proyectos de transporte comunitario a pequeña escala aparte de la construcción tradicional de carreteras, como mejorar la seguridad de los peatones y el acceso al tránsito, construir instalaciones e infraestructura para bicicletas, mitigación ambiental y más. Específicamente, el proyecto de ley aumenta el financiamiento para asistencia técnica y asegura que se ponga más a disposición de los gobiernos y agencias locales para financiar e implementar estos proyectos.

“Me enorgullece presentar la Ley de Mejoras de Alternativas de Transporte para ayudar a las comunidades de todo el país a construir una mejor infraestructura para circular en bicicleta y caminar, como senderos, puentes para peatones y bicicletas, y varios otros proyectos que conectarán y brindarán a los residentes rutas alternativas para viajar en sus comunidades locales. Creo firmemente que este proyecto de ley alentará a los gobiernos locales a repensar la forma en que usan el dinero del transporte para hacer que su infraestructura no solo sea más accesible, sino también mejor para nuestro medio ambiente y mejor para la salud de los residentes. Estos proyectos también contribuirán a mejorar la seguridad de los peatones y los motociclistas, deteniendo el reciente e inquietante aumento de casos de muertes"", dijo el congresista Adriano Espaillat (NY-13), miembro del Comité de Infraestructura y Transporte de la Cámara y el único miembro que representa a la ciudad de Nueva York, que alberga el sistema de transporte más grande de la nación.

“Invertir en la infraestructura del estado de Washington no solo es importante para aviones, autobuses y automóviles, sino también para ciclistas y peatones. El año pasado, realicé dos reuniones comunitarias sobre el uso de bicicletas en las que recorrí proyectos de infraestructura para bicicletas y peatones en mi distrito y escuché directamente de la comunidad sobre mejoras cruciales de seguridad que esperaban ver en el futuro. Los líderes locales en Bellingham y Lynnwood están priorizando las inversiones en aceras, senderos y ciclovías para conectar mejor partes de sus respectivas ciudades. Como miembro sénior del Comité de Infraestructura y Transporte de la Cámara, continuaré apoyando esfuerzos como la Ley de Mejoras de Alternativas de Transporte para asegurar que las comunidades en el noroeste del Pacífico y en todo Estados Unidos tengan los recursos para realizar las mejoras de seguridad necesarias, aumentar las opciones de movilidad y ayudar a reducir la congestión del tráfico y la contaminación"", dijo el congresista Rick Larsen (WA-02).

“Los gobiernos locales -las autoridades de planificación y transporte- generalmente comprenden las necesidades de tránsito de sus comunidades mejor que los funcionarios estatales o federales. Sin embargo, el Gobierno federal puede ser un socio fuerte, al empoderar a los líderes locales con los recursos para mejorar sus vecindarios, mejorar el desarrollo económico y mejorar la calidad de vida y la salud pública"", dijo el senador Ben Cardin, miembro de rango del subcomité del Senado de Medio Ambiente y Obras Públicas de Transporte e Infraestructura. ""Estoy orgulloso de trabajar con nuestros colegas de la Cámara en esta prioridad bicameral y bipartidista"".

""El Programa de Alternativas de Transporte (TAP) es la fuente de financiación esencial para las comunidades de todo el país que buscan crear rutas seguras a las escuelas, empleos, tiendas y otros destinos clave"", dijo Cassandra Isidro, directora Ejecutiva. ""La Asociación de Rutas Seguras felicita al congresista Espaillat por su liderazgo en el fortalecimiento y la expansión de los fondos para TAP, lo que ayudará a que sea más seguro para las personas que caminan y circulan en bicicleta y crea opciones de transporte asequibles, saludables y amigables con el clima"".

""En nombre de los millones de personas en Estados Unidos que usan bicicleta para su transporte, para su salud y para divertirse, la Liga de Ciclistas Estadounidenses aplaude el liderazgo demostrado por el congresista Espaillat al introducir la Ley de Mejora de Alternativas de Transporte"", dijo Bill Nesper, director ejecutivo de la Liga de Ciclistas Estadounidenses. “Este proyecto de ley no solo aumentaría la financiación de proyectos de infraestructura para hacer que el ciclismo y la caminata sean más seguros y accesibles, sino que también realiza cambios técnicos críticos en el programa que permitirán que más estadounidenses se beneficien de los proyectos de Alternativas de Transporte. Aprobar esta legislación sería un paso necesario para construir un Estados Unidos más amigable con las bicicletas para todos”.

Un complemento de la Ley de Mejoras de Alternativas de Transporte fue introducido en el Senado esta primavera por el senador Ben Cardin (D-Maryland) y el senador Roger Wicker (R-Mississippi), y obtuvieron un amplio apoyo bipartidista. Una versión del proyecto de ley fue introducido en la reautorización final del transporte de superficie aprobado por el Comité de Medio Ambiente y Obras Públicas del Senado. El proyecto de ley de Espaillat en la Cámara fortalece aún más el programa de asistencia técnica al garantizar que se utilicen todos los fondos designados para circular en bicicleta y caminar, al tiempo que proporciona la flexibilidad necesaria a los gobiernos locales y estatales.

Biden's First Days in Office
 
This week, Americans in every state and territory witnessed a transition of power and the swearing in of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. As we make this transition, I have every intention of holding President Biden accountable for his promise to serve all Americans and not just those who are members of his party. I expect our new President to put the best interests of America and our people first. 
 
As we've seen over the last four years under President Trump's leadership, we delivered many victories to the families of south Mississippi such as a record-breaking economy, a stronger military, a more secure border, modernized trade agreements, record job creation, a renewed focus on NASA and space exploration, the confirmation of three Supreme Court Justices, left the disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal and rolled out the COVID-19 vaccine to restore our way of life. These all are very notable accomplishments, and I commend President Trump on a job well done.
 
Let it be known that America’s problems are not best met with socialist proposals that are going to further erode our years of historic economic success, grow our national debt, and stifle job creation. Americans deserve real solutions that will get this country back on track. 
 
 
Millions of Jobs Killed in Hours
 
￼
 
Within hours of being sworn in, President Biden moved forward with executive orders that immediately killed jobs for American workers. For nearly a year, job loss has been at the forefront of the pandemic. Our new president is now directly contributing to job loss through his executive orders on the Paris Climate Accord and the Keystone XL pipeline.  
 
All of these actions will hamper efforts to rebuild the economy and restore our way of life. Now is not the time to kill job opportunities, it is time to create them.
 
Not only did he kill jobs, but he also halted progress on the border wall, jeopardizing the safety of Americans and our national security. With a few strokes of a pen, he is trying to undo the successes of the previous Adminstration. President Biden is now pushing a proposal to grant mass amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants in the United States. Let me be clear, I am strongly opposed to mass amnesty and believe actions like this only incentivize and reward more unlawful behavior. If someone wants to enter and live in our country they must do so legally.
 
 
Palazzo on National Guard Being Kicked Out of Capitol
 
￼
 
As we all know, in the days leading up to the inauguration, thousands of National Guard troops were ordered to our nation's capital to help quell any potentially violent protests on or around inauguration day. Only one day after the inauguration, National Guard troops were kicked out of the capitol complex and forced to make camp in underground parking garages. This is shamefully unnacceptable and I will be seeking answers as to why our servicemembers were disrespected in such a way. 
 
Seeing fellow guardsmen who have dropped everything in their lives to protect the sacred halls of Congress being kicked out of the building without explanation is reprehensible. These men and women representing every corner of this country deserve our unending praise, not to be pushed into a parking garage with a light pat on the back.
 
 
Pascagoula's Sarah Thomas Making NFL History
 
We are so incredibly proud of this Pascagoula native! Sarah Thomas, a previous speaker at my Palazzo Youth Leadership Summit, will make history on February 7 as the first female to officiate the Super Bowl.
 
She has much to be proud of both on and off the field. I have no doubt she will do an excellent job during Super Bowl LV. Keep making us proud!
 
￼
 
 
Final Note
 
We are continuing to monitor and fight the COVID-19 pandemic. With a new liberal Administration in office, I am going to be fighting more than ever on behalf of south Mississippi to defend our Constitution and principles. We have many issues facing us that cannot be met with partisan solutions that will bankrupt our country and stifle the American dream. 
 
Please know my office remains ready to serve you and the families of Mississippi's Fourth Congressional District. Whether it's writing an email to share your thoughts with me or reaching out for help with a federal agency, we are here for you. Please do not hesistate to contact me if there is anything I can ever do to be of service to you. 
 
Always in your service,
￼

Wicker Encourages Biden to Unify America 
Impeachment and Far-Left Proposals Will Not Heal Divisions 
On January 20, my wife Gayle and I joined dozens of other lawmakers at the U.S. Capitol to observe the orderly transfer of power. I had attended multiple inaugurations before, but this year’s occasion was unlike any I had ever seen. The National Mall, which is normally packed with visitors from across America, was closed because of health restrictions. At the same time, more than 25,000 National Guard troops, including several hundred of our Mississippi Guardsmen, were on site to ensure peace and order. 
Upon taking the oath of office, Joe Biden became our 46th President. I did not support him as a candidate, but I am praying for him as he leads our country through a difficult period. I appreciated his call for national healing and reconciliation. We should all work to lower the temperature and move forward as one unified nation. 
Impeachment Is a Mistake 
Unfortunately, the effort to remove a President who is no longer in office raises serious constitutional questions and threatens to delay national healing. This article of impeachment was rushed through the House of Representatives shortly after the Capitol riot without hearings or any careful consideration of evidence against President Trump. As President-elect, Mr. Biden could have used his influence to stop the impeachment process from going forward. Such a gesture could have gone a long way toward unifying the country. 
A second impeachment trial is sure to inflame partisan tensions and could poison the cooperative spirit we need in a 50-50 Senate. I fear it will also bring more reproach on Congress’s solemn impeachment power, which should be used sparingly and with sober deliberation. Impeachment could also interrupt President Biden’s Cabinet confirmations for weeks while the Senate holds a trial as required by the Constitution. The Senate has important business to do and should not be held up by a pointless and divisive delay. 
Biden’s First Actions Raise Alarm 
On his first day in office, President Biden signed multiple executive orders that reveal his administration’s priorities. I am deeply concerned about the impact these decisions will have on our country. 
One of President Biden’s first steps was to revoke the permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline, a vital energy project that President Trump had approved. Cancellation of this pipeline will needlessly limit our oil supply and cost as many as 11,000 jobs, representing $1.6 billion in lost wages. This reversal is also an insult to Canada, which was depending on the pipeline to move oil to America. President Biden has spoken of “repairing” our alliances, but this is a big step backward. 
President Biden also reversed Trump’s policy of strict immigration enforcement and imposed a 100-day pause on deportations. This sends a terrible signal to those trying to enter our country illegally, like the caravans that are currently advancing toward our border. As a Senator in 2006, Mr. Biden supported the Secure Fence Act, which authorized funds for border control barriers. He served as Vice President in the Obama Administration, which engaged in a sensible deportation policy for illegal immigrants. His change of heart sends a troubling signal of radical policies to come. 
Biden Should Lead With Bipartisanship 
President Biden has pledged to represent all Americans and help unify our nation. I hope he fulfills this pledge by focusing on ideas that enjoy bipartisan support. The Senate Commerce Committee, which I chaired for the last two years, has made great progress on expanding broadband to rural America, building infrastructure, and supporting our transportation sector. I stand ready to work with President Biden on these and other unifying priorities.

PRESS RELEASE
For Immediate Release
January 25, 2021


NYS COVID Rent Relief Program Accepting Applications Through February 1, 2021

The New York State Division of Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) has reopened the COVID Rent Relief Program and will be accepting new applications through Monday, February 1, 2021


NEW YORK, NY -- The New York State Division of Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) has reopened the COVID Rent Relief Program and will be accepting new applications through Monday, February 1, 2021.  The program’s eligibility criteria have been expanded to provide rent relief to more New Yorkers.  Individuals who applied during the previous application window and were denied, do not need to apply again.  Those applications are being reviewed again.  Additionally, applications from individuals who have not received a response from the HCR are being reviewed under the new criteria. 

If approved, applicants will receive a subsidy for the difference between a household’s rent burden on March 1, 2020 and the household’s rent burden in the months of April, May, June, and July 2020.  The subsidy is a one-time payment available for a maximum of four months of rent, up to 125% of the Fair Market Rents (FMR) for that household’s area.  HCR will send payments directly to the applicant’s landlord.

To qualify, applicants must meet all of the eligibility requirements:

• You must be a renter with primary residence in New York State.

• Before March 7, 2020, and at the time of application, your household income (including unemployment benefits) must have been below 80% of the area median income, adjusted for household size.  You can find your county’s area median income, based on your household size, here. 

• Households must be “rent-burdened” during the months they are applying for assistance between April 1 to July 31, 2020.  A household is rent-burdened if they are paying more than 30 percent of their income towards housing costs. 

• You must have lost income during the period of April 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020.

Detailed information about the program, including eligibility criteria, the application process, the documents that will be requested as part of the application process, and answers to frequently answered questions are available on HCR's website.  Additionally, HCR is operating a special helpline to answer questions and provide assistance with the application process.  For help, applicants can contact HCR’s COVID Rent Relief Extension Program Call Center for assistance at 1-833-499-0318 or covidrentrelief@hcr.ny.gov.  Call Center representatives are available Monday through Friday 8:30am – 5:00pm. 

If you are chosen to receive a rental subsidy through this program, New York State will cover the difference between your household's rent burden on March 1, 2020 and your household's increase in rent burden during the period your household is applying for assistance.  Households can apply for up to four months of assistance for the months of April 2020 through July 2020.  Tenants do not have to be behind in their rent to receive assistance.  Tenants who are current on their rent payments can have funds applied towards a credit for future months.  The rent subsidy payment will go directly to your landlord. 

Deadline to submit your application is Monday, February 1, 2021. 

Apply online today or visit NYS Homes and Community Renewal for more information.

Si es aprobada, los solicitantes recibirán un subsidio por la diferencia entre la carga del alquiler del hogar el 1 de marzo de 2020 y la carga del alquiler del hogar en los meses de abril, mayo, junio y julio de 2020.  El subsidio es un pago único disponible para un máximo de cuatro meses de alquiler, hasta el 125% de los Alquileres Justos de Mercado (FMR) que se pagan en el área de esa vivienda.  HCR enviará los pagos directamente al casero del solicitante.

Para calificar, los solicitantes deben cumplir con todos los requisitos de elegibilidad:

• Debe ser un inquilino con residencia principal en el Estado de Nueva York.

• Antes del 7 de marzo de 2020 y en el momento de la solicitud, los ingresos de su hogar (incluidos los beneficios de desempleo) deben haber estado por debajo del 80% del ingreso medio del área, ajustado al tamaño del hogar. Puede encontrar el ingreso medio del área de su condado, según el tamaño de su hogar, aquí.

• Los hogares deben estar “sobrecargados por el alquiler” durante los meses en que solicitan asistencia entre el 1 de abril y el 31 de julio de 2020.  Un hogar está sobrecargado por el alquiler si paga más del 30 por ciento de sus ingresos para los costos de vivienda.

• Usted debe haber perdido ingresos durante el período del 1 de abril de 2020 al 31 de julio de 2020.

La información detallada sobre el programa, incluidos los criterios de elegibilidad, el proceso de solicitud, los documentos que se solicitarán como parte del proceso de solicitud y las respuestas a las preguntas frecuentes están disponibles en el sitio web de HCR. Además, HCR tiene en funcionamiento una línea de ayuda especial para responder preguntas y brindar asistencia con el proceso de solicitud. Para obtener ayuda, los solicitantes pueden comunicarse con el Centro de Llamadas del Programa Extendido de Ayuda para el Alquiler por COVID de HCR al 1-833-499-0318 o covidrentrelief@hcr.ny.gov.  Los representantes del Centro de Llamadas están disponibles de lunes a viernes de 8:30 am a 5:00 pm.

Si es elegido para recibir un subsidio de alquiler a través de este programa, el Estado de Nueva York cubrirá la diferencia entre la carga del alquiler de su hogar el 1 de marzo de 2020 y el aumento de la carga del alquiler de su hogar durante el período en que su hogar está solicitando asistencia. Los hogares pueden solicitar hasta cuatro meses de asistencia para los meses de abril de 2020 a julio de 2020. Los inquilinos no tienen que estar atrasados en el pago del alquiler para recibir asistencia. A los inquilinos que están al día en sus pagos de alquiler se les pueden aplicar fondos para un crédito para meses futuros. El pago del subsidio de alquiler irá directamente a su casero.

La fecha límite para enviar su solicitud es el lunes, 1 de febrero de 2021.

￼ 
Dear Neighbor,  I write to you at the end of another historic week.  I was honored to be present to witness the inauguration of President Biden and Vice President Harris on Wednesday and to hear the message of unity, optimism, and hope of President Biden’s address.  Recent events have challenged us all in different ways, and President Biden acknowledged this difficult moment while reminding us how we work through challenges: we do it together.  In his address, we saw leadership, compassion, and competence at a time when we need them most.   I look forward to working in the 117th Congress to address them.  In the first few days of this new administration, we have seen important efforts to address the coronavirus pandemic and to respond to the health and economic challenges before us.  While we are certain to have differences in opinion and policy, including some of the administration’s early actions relating to energy, I am optimistic about the possibilities ahead to work together to address our most pressing challenges. 
￼

￼

On Friday, I had the privilege of thanking our Texas Army National Guard troops protecting the U.S. Capitol, including the 72nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team based in our district, for their service and dedication to our country and our Constitution.

￼

￼
￼
On Thursday, I voted in favor of a waiver making possible the confirmation of General Lloyd Austin III to serve as Secretary of Defense.  The Senate confirmed his appointment on Friday.  Secretary Austin has the experience, leadership, and vision to protect our country, and I was glad to vote to support his historic confirmation.  I also remain focused on addressing the root causes and security failures contributing to the attack on the Capitol on January 6.  This week, after my colleagues and I called for an independent investigation, the Government Accountability Office announced it will investigate  the security failures of the U.S. Capitol attack.  Previously, the Department of Defense announced that it would launch an investigation and the Speaker of the House announced that Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré will lead a review of the U.S. Capitol’s security.  This week, our newly formed committees will get to work.  I am glad to have been appointed to serve on the Energy & Commerce Committee this Congress, and will send you an update on our work next week.
￼

Across the country, new COVID cases and deaths are down in week-to-week comparisons.  The number of new cases confirmed January 15-21 decreased by approximately 20 percent.  While this is welcome news, the total number of cases in the country has reached a new high.  Yesterday afternoon, our country recorded 25 million coronavirus cases, about one in every 13 people in the country, or about 7.6 percent of the population.  Hospitalizations for the virus continue place added strain to our health care providers.  Harris County COVID-19 Datahub shows that more than 34 percent of ICU beds are occupied by COVID patients.  That’s the highest level since August.  The positivity rate in our region remains high at just under 20 percent.

As you have likely seen in the news, the Biden administration has announced plans to address the pandemic by increasing testing, accelerating vaccine distribution, and more.  I found this a useful overview.

It is critical that each of us continues to do our part to stop the spread of the virus to help protect the health of our community.  I know many are eager for information about vaccine availability and timing, and this will be a top priority for me and the Energy & Commerce Committee.  I know that Harris County officials are working around the clock to ensure efficient vaccinations for people across our district, but we will do all we can to aid the efforts, including supporting use of the Defense Production Act to ensure continued access to sufficient medical supplies and personal protective equipment necessary for testing and vaccination.

Dear Friends,  This week, I joined fellow lawmakers at our nation's Capitol for President Joe Biden's inauguration. While I did not vote for him, I have tremendous respect for the office of the President of the United States, and, as has always been my policy with the previous two administrations, I will work with the new administration to seek common ground when possible to advance the causes of freedom and opportunity for all Americans. I ask you to join me in praying that God grant strength and wisdom to the new President, Vice President, their families, and the entire United States of America.
 
In Your Service,

A Peaceful Transition of Power and
Getting to Work

Friends,
 
After a grueling few weeks in Congress, we've finally begun to move past the vitriol and division of the election and onward to doing the job you sent us here to do. President Joe Biden was sworn in as our nation’s next Commander-in-Chief and a new Secretary of Defense was confirmed just a few days later. 
 
Right now, our nation is facing deep division and we must do our best to come together as Americans for the good of our country, rather than furthering this division. I am determined to work with President Biden when I feel he's working for the good of every American, but challenge him when his actions undermine the liberty and prosperity of America and the Lowcountry.

Unfortunately, President Biden spent his first few days issuing a series of executive orders that will destroy jobs and hurt South Carolinians. 

Several of these orders, including freezing rules that would've lowered insulin prices for countless Americans and rejoining the Paris Climate Accord reverses the successes we saw under President Trump and will cost us tens of thousands of jobs at a time when we can’t afford to lose a single one. Furthermore, President Biden is already showing a troubling inclination to continue America's involvement in forever wars overseas and spy programs that violate Americans' liberties. 

As I said, I am ready and willing to work with the new administration wherever possible, but their day one actions are troubling and should concern any independent-minded fiscal conservative. I will continue to work to protect our freedoms, using the Constitution as my guide. And as such, I will continue to be a strong, new voice for all those who seek the same. 

Now, it's time to get down to business. 
 
Sincerely, 
￼

1/24/21 18:30,A New Day in America,"￼ 
Friends,   I hope you and your families are staying healthy and safe. Here’s what I was up to this week in the Senate: 
 

￼
ONE: A New Day in America
On Wednesday, I attended the historic inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. It brought me tremendous pride to see the first Black and Asian American woman sworn-in as Vice President. I was also inspired by President Biden’s call for unity, compassion, and resolve in the face of the many challenges confronting our country. I look forward to working with the Biden-Harris administration to deliver for the American people, from defeating COVID-19 and rebuilding our economy to healing a divided people at home and repairing our relationships abroad.
 
￼ 
TWO: Fighting COVID-19
Yet even as we celebrated the inauguration of a new president, we also marked a grim milestone: COVID-19 has now claimed more than 400,000 lives across America. Now more than ever we need the kind of aggressive, federally-coordinated pandemic response the Biden-Harris Administration is working to get off the ground – especially when it comes to testing and vaccine distribution. That’s why I was pleased to announce more than half-a-billion dollars is on the way to help New Jersey expand access to vaccines for more of our nine million residents. Learn how to register for the COVID-19 vaccine in New Jersey here. 
 
￼
THREE: The U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021
As the son of Cuban immigrants and the highest-ranking Latino in the U.S. Senate, on Thursday I was honored to announce I will soon introduce the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 – President Biden’s bold and progressive vision for immigration reform. The bill creates an eight-year path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who meet specific criteria and addresses the root causes of migration to our southern border by cracking down on transnational crime, promoting the rule of law, and advancing human rights in Central America. At the same time, the bill clears out visa backlogs, reunites families, protects workers’ rights, and helps more STEM graduates of our universities stay in the country and contribute to our economy. Watch my announcement of this legislation here. 
 
Make sure to follow me on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook to stay up to date on what’s happening in New Jersey and in the Capitol.   Sincerely,   ￼  Senator Bob Menendez

Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 1.24.21
Sunday, January 24, 2021 –                                 
Presidential Inaugurations
Since 1789, the inauguration of a president of the United States every four years has functioned as an important civic ritual that transcends partisan politics.
The Constitution originally said very little about inaugural ceremonies, only stating that the president must take an oath before assuming office. The 20th Amendment set the time for the transfer of power at noon on January 20. Otherwise, the inaugural ceremonies have depended on our traditions and the individuals taking office.
As in many other things, George Washington set precedents for how inaugurations would work. He took the oath of office as the first president of the United States on April 30, 1789 in New York City, the federal capital at the time. The former general chose to wear an American-made suit of plain brown broadcloth. He added the phrase “so help me God” to the end of the oath. Although the Constitution makes no mention of an inaugural address, he opted to give a speech lasting about ten minutes in the Senate chamber after he took the oath.
Inaugurations have followed the pattern set by Washington in the years since, with some changes. John Adams’ inauguration in Philadelphia in 1797 marked the first transfer of power from one president to another. Ceremonies were moved outside beginning with James Monroe in 1817 and held on the West Front of the Capitol since Ronald Reagan’s first inauguration in 1981 (his second in 1985 was held inside because of extreme cold).
The inaugural addresses in particular occupy an important place in our tradition, as they have sometimes included rhetoric that earns an honored place in American history. Thomas Jefferson used his first address to say, “We are all Republicans, we are all Federalists.” Abraham Lincoln’s first inaugural appealed to “the better angels of our nature” and his second called for “malice toward none” and “charity for all.” Franklin Roosevelt declared that “the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.”
Considering the importance presidential inaugurations have in our traditions, I consider it my duty as a Member of Congress to attend regardless of the individual being sworn in. It is a matter of respect for the office of president of the United States and for our system of government.
In this column four years ago, I stated disappointment in the fact that dozens of Democratic Members of Congress had decided to boycott President Trump’s inauguration. I believed their choice disrespected our institutions and the peaceful transfer of power. I said as long as I was in office absent an illness in my family, I would be at an inauguration no matter the individual being sworn in.
Therefore, on January 20, 2021 I attended the swearing in of President Joe Biden. The 2020 election was not the first presidential election with controversy, nor will it be the last. No matter whom you supported in November or what you think about the process, Joe Biden is our president now and deserves our respect.
Because of the coronavirus pandemic, this year’s ceremony looked different than the ones I have attended previously, but the basic outlines remained the same. New Vice President Kamala Harris was sworn in first. Chief Justice Roberts swore in the new President a few minutes before noon, and he began his inaugural address.
I expect that I will have plenty of occasions to respectfully disagree with President Biden and his Administration in the years to come, but I appreciate the tone with which he started his presidency.
The change in administration does not change my priorities: serving the needs of Virginia’s Ninth Congressional District. If I can meet them by working with the new Administration, I will do so. If meeting them means opposing the new Administration, I will do that as well.
But those agreements and disagreements were not the point of January 20. The inaugural ceremonies express our shared commitment as Americans to our Constitution and representative government. I think that’s important. I urge the new Administration to maintain that commitment throughout its term, not only at its beginning.
If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office.  You can call my Abingdon office at 276-525-1405 or my Christiansburg office at 540-381-5671.

1/24/21 17:14,BACON BRIEF: DC Report Week of January 18,"￼
January 24, 2021
 
DC Report - Week of January 18
 
 
We are under way for the first week of President Biden’s administration, and much has happened Including many things I am concerned about. But, let’s first address what is on the minds of many:
“When can I get vaccinated and will there be enough vaccines?”
I want to stress that the United States has been on track in terms of production to distribute 100 million doses in 100 days due to the last administration. In fact, contracts for 300 million doses of the vaccine were in place before President Biden was sworn in. If he would like to develop a new plan to administer 200 million vaccines in 100 days, I stand ready to work with him to speed up production. 
I want to commend Governor Ricketts and the team at Nebraska’s Department of Health and Human Services for rolling out a great vaccine distribution plan. If you would like information on where and when you can get one, click here. 
While I applaud President Bidens comments on bipartisanship and unity, his immediate actions contradict that message.
Within the first two days of taking office, President Biden signed 17 executive orders addressing the pandemic, immigration and visas, climate change, the economy, and other areas. While I like having our nation with a seat at the table in the Paris Climate Accords, I do oppose the limits agreed to by President Obama that demands immediate sacrifices by Americans but gives China over a decade before any actions are required. This will incentivize American businesses to move to China.  Some call this the Chinese Chamber of Commerce plan because it hurts America’s businesses but gives a free pass to China’s for many years.  We should be proud of the work our country has done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. While our country became the largest energy producing country in the world, we also cut carbon emissions by more than the next 12 countries combined. The most recent data shows total reported GHG emissions from large facilities decreased by more than 14% from 2011 to 2019. EPA Report
Additionally, I am deeply concerned for our economy because of two energy related executive orders just signed: 
	1.	The revocation of the permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline.
	2.	A ban for 60 days on new oil and gas drilling permits and leases for federal land and waters. 
The cancellation of the Keystone permit was a punch in the gut to thousands of skilled workers in Nebraska who were counting on that construction job to feed their families and pay their bills. The President said he did this to save our climate, but all it has done is show Saudi Arabia and Venezuela that the United States is ready to buy their oil. For those wondering, TransCanada has worked to make this a carbon-neutral pipeline and construction project; the “gold-standard of sustainable development.”  The pipeline was rerouted to safeguard Nebraska’s water. The results of these Biden executive orders are that we are taking a step backwards in maintaining energy independence, costing great paying union jobs and we’ve proven to be an untrustworthy partner to Canada. Nebraska will also lose property and income tax revenue that could have gone towards our schools, infrastructure, and tax relief. I have always embraced an “all of the above” approach to energy.  I am proud that Omaha gets approximately 40% of its energy from renewable sources.
In short, the Executive Orders will undermine our economy and gains made in energy independence.  Instead of boosting our economy and working to reopen businesses that have been curtailed or shuttered for too long, more jobs have been canceled by an action that primarily serves to satisfy special interests but not the needs of Nebraskans 
Separate from the Executive Orders, I did vote in support of Lloyd Austin to be our next Secretary of Defense.  He served in our military for 40 years and has a wealth of national security experience all over the world. He will provide steady leadership for our Department of Defense.
I praised the President’s inauguration speech, in which he spoke of unity and working with the other side to find common ground and help America get back on its feet after the battle with COVID. I will work to find ways we can get the mom-and-pop stores of America back open. I will seek consensus to find ways to reduce the cost of healthcare and to reform our immigration laws while upholding the rule of law.   
God bless and stay healthy!
 
Sincerely,
￼

Friends,

As someone who considers it an honor and a privilege to witness the peaceful transition of power - a pillar of our democracy - I attended the inauguration ceremony on Wednesday. I have now proudly attended five presidential inaugurations, regardless of whether or not I voted for who was elected. 
￼

While I did not vote for President Biden and Vice President Harris, I wish them the best because the fact of the matter is that their success is the American people’s success. We will not always agree on how to achieve that success, but I will always be willing to reach across the aisle with the respect and civility necessary for us to work together so that we can effectively tackle the challenges facing our country.

Thanking the Ohio Soldiers Who Helped Secure Our Nation's Capital


On Thursday, I got the chance to spend some time with several Ohio National Guard soldiers who helped support civilian law enforcement secure the U.S. Capitol and surrounding areas leading up to and during the inauguration. 

These brave men and women left their jobs and families during our time of need, and while it is deeply troubling that the support of our National Guardsmen and women was necessary to preserve and uphold the rule of law in our nation’s capital, I am thankful that their efforts helped ensure a peaceful transition of power. 

They have selflessly stepped up in so many ways this year, by facilitating vaccine distribution to our seniors and helping Ohioans in need at local food banks. I couldn't be prouder of their unwavering professionalism and dedication to their community and their country.
￼

Of course, we had to get in a loud and proud OH-IO! before they headed back home to the Buckeye State (click here or on the photo above to hear it). 

Securing Critical Projects for Northeast Ohio in New Army Corps Work Plan

I'm pleased to report that several projects critical to Northeast Ohio and the Great Lakes have been incorporated in the fiscal year 2021 (FY21) U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Work Plan, including the preconstruction of the Asian carp barrier at Brandon Road Lock and Dam, and the removal of dredged material in the Conneaut, Ashtabula, Fairport and Cleveland Harbors. 

Any threat to the Great Lakes is a threat to our regional economy, the jobs of thousands of hardworking Buckeyes, the drinking water supply for millions, and the ecosystem of more than 3,500 plants and animals. That’s why I have tirelessly advocated for these projects and fought to provide them with the funding they need as a member of the House Appropriations Committee.

Specifically, the FY21 USACE Work Plan includes $3.8 million for the Brandon Road Lock and Dam Project, which is a key choke point intended to block Asian carp’s access to the Great Lakes ecosystem. Combined with state level funding, the resources provided by the Work Plan will allow for the continuation of preconstruction, engineering and design work. It also includes funding to support Operations and Maintenance activities such as dredging in Northeast Ohio harbors including:
	•	$23.941 million for Cleveland Harbor
	•	$911,000 for the Conneaut Harbor
	•	$1.42 million for Fairport Harbor
	•	$2.29 million for Ashtabula Harbor

By providing the funding needed to further the Brandon Road Lock and Dam Project and remove dredged material in our harbors, we will help mitigate the threat invasive Asian carp pose to Lake Erie and help ensure our harbors can continue operating at full capacity and making significant contributions to our regional economy. I applaud the Army Corps of Engineers for prioritizing these projects in their latest Work Plan and look forward to seeing the benefits they’ll provide to our communities.

Reaffirming My Dedication to Bipartisanship, Commonsense Lawmaking

On Friday, the Problem Solvers Caucus announced its members for the 117th Congress. I am proud to say that I remain an active member of this bipartisan group. 

For those who haven't heard of it before, the Problem Solvers Caucus is an independent group in Congress comprised of representatives from across the country – equally divided between Democrats and Republicans – committed to finding common ground on many of the key issues facing the nation.  

Those of us in the caucus are united in the idea that there are commonsense solutions to many of our country's toughest challenges, but they can be found only when we work together as Americans to successfully break through the gridlock of today’s politics. 
￼

Now more than ever, Americans deserve a good-faith effort from their elected officials to drop the toxic blue team versus red team mentality and work together to solve the challenges facing our nation.

As I've said before, fairly evaluating ideas outside of our own ideology doesn’t require us to stray from our principles or force us to adopt views we’re fundamentally opposed to. All it takes is for us to give each other the chance to be seen not as a member of a political party, but as men and women with values, families and loved ones, and experiences that have shaped who we are and what we stand for. By doing so, we not only encourage effective lawmaking, we also ensure that when we do disagree, we can do so respectfully. 

I am proud to be a member of the Problem Solvers Caucus and look forward to working across the aisle to prioritize the needs of OH-14.

God bless and stay well,

Dave

Congressman McHenry Weekly Update 
 
Reflecting on the Biden Inauguration 
 
This week Joe Biden was sworn in as our nation's 46th President. Congratulations to President Biden. In the days ahead I am hopeful we can come together to confront the challenges facing our nation. 

The inauguration also gave me the opportunity to reflect on everything President Trump accomplished over the past four years. Here are just a few of the promises President Trump kept: tax relief for families and small businesses like those I represent in the Tenth District, scrapping NAFTA and replacing it with a more pro-America trade deal—the USMCA—that is a huge win for American workers and western North Carolina’s textile industry, keeping our borders secure, and supporting for our military so they have resources they need to keep us safe. Thank you President Trump for everything you accomplished for the Tenth District and the American people.

Unfortunately, President Biden has already moved to undo many of our economic and diplomatic wins from the past four years. The unprecedented scope of the 17 executive orders he signed last week aren't a step toward unity, they will destroy jobs and hurt the American people. Americans want the country united in defeating the coronavirus and getting the economy back to full strength.

￼

 
Standing Up For Life
 
Last Friday, marked forty-eight years since the Supreme Court passed down the tragic decision in Roe v. Wade, a decision that requires us to stand together to protect and defend the sanctity of human life. I am thankful for the Americans from all across the country committed to protecting the unborn and standing up against the tragedy of abortion. I am proud to stand with you, today and every day, to keep our promise to protect the lives of those who cannot defend themselves.

Vaccine Distribution in North Carolina
 
In our battle against the coronavirus, there are already two FDA approved coronavirus vaccines available and several more on the way. We are beginning to see the positive results these vaccines have had on our communities. However, the successful distribution and administration of these vaccines depends on the work of state officials. This week I joined my fellow House Republicans from North Carolina in sending a letter to Governor Cooper asking for him to share detailed information on North Carolina's plan to distribute and administer vaccines. Click here or on the image below to read the letter.

Denouncing the Left's Attacks on Reverend Graham
 
It seems there is no limit to the radical left’s cancel culture and crusade to silence all with whom they disagree. Their latest target is Rev. Franklin Graham. Calling for his removal as the head of Samaritan’s Purse and the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association is ludicrous.

Under Franklin’s leadership, both organizations have ministered and provided relief to countless people in need across the globe for decades. I am especially grateful to the team at Samaritan’s Purse who are currently serving our area in a mobile hospital they have deployed to battle the Covid-19 pandemic. Click here to read my full statement on the left’s ridiculous attacks on Reverend Graham.

What I've Been Reading

More than 300 NC National Guard troops to return home early next week following Biden inauguration

ABC 11 

I am thankful for all of the N.C. National Guard troops who were among the thousands of National Guard troops from across the country who came to DC to help with the inauguration. We are proud of you and your service to this great nation. But it was distressing to see the mistreatment that some of these troops received following the week’s events. We must get to the bottom of how and why this occurred.

A New Administration
President Joe Biden took the oath of office this week during a health crisis and significant political strife.
I commend President Biden for his call for national unity, and his assurance to those who did not support him that he will nevertheless be president for all Americans. I urge the president to follow through on this commitment by working with members of Congress from both sides of the aisle to pursue policies that will lead to peace and prosperity for all Americans. I am praying for President Biden and his success in leading our country forward.

The Natural Treasure of Presque Isle State Park
Presque Isle State Park offers miles of beautiful coastline for over four million visitors annually. As both a natural treasure and an economic driver for northwestern Pennsylvania, it is vitally important to ensure that the beaches of Presque Isle are properly maintained. This week, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' assisted in this effort by allocating $1.5 million towards the Presque Isle State Park beach nourishment project.
I was happy to offer my support for this important project by sending a letter earlier this year to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers urging continued federal assistance to this project.
￼
￼
Bad Economic Policy
This week, President Biden revoked the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline. The Keystone XL pipeline was approved by bipartisan majorities in both chambers of Congress in 2015. Revoking the Presidential Permit for the pipeline is bad economic policy, costs American jobs, and, as one of President Biden's first actions, runs counter to his stated goal of building bipartisan consensus early on in his administration.

Update on COVID-19
In the past few weeks, Pennsylvania and the rest of the country have experienced a concerning jump in new COVID-19 cases. While vaccines are now available, the threat of this virus is still very real.
It remains important that people continue to follow CDC recommendations: adhere to social distancing guidelines, wash your hands often, and wear a mask if you are heading out. Remember: my mask protects you and your mask protects me.
According to the Pennsylvania Department of Health, across the state as of Friday, January 22, 2021:
	•	15% of all hospital beds were available
	•	Over 70% of ventilators were available
	•	Over 15% of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds were available 
As of that date, positive cases in Pennsylvania reached 794,172, roughly a 0.7% increase from the prior day, and more than 3,533,700 tests had come back negative. This means almost 82% of Pennsylvanians tested for COVID-19 had a result that came back negative.

For more detailed information about resources available to you, visit the COVID-19 resource page on my website.

Futher Information:

The Centers for Disease Control provides updates on the virus and safety information for the public and healthcare professionals here.

The Pennsylvania Department of Health provides information on the virus and safety precautions here.

I encourage all Pennsylvanians to take this situation very seriously and observe the recommendations developed by the CDC.

Predicting Future U.S./China Relations Under Biden
Is the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) a real threat? YES. Look at Hong Kong over the last 18 months. That’s what happens to a democracy under the rule of Beijing.

The CCP is our greatest foreign adversary, yet Joe Biden rejoined the World Health Organization and Paris Agreement (which both favor the communist regime) on day one of his presidency.

Are Walls Immoral or Not?

When they’re built to protect the rest of the country from human traffickers, deadly drugs, and dangerous cartels they’re deemed “immoral.""

Latest News
Visiting the leadership of NC National Guardsmen deployed to the Capitol
￼
On Thursday I had the opportunity to meet with Lt. Col McVeigh and his staff of North Carolina's 105th Engineering Battalion. They were tasked with leading the North Carolina National Guardsmen who have been deployed to our nation's capitol. I thanked them for their dedication and sense of duty. It was truly remarkable to see the speed and precision with which over 300 North Carolinians left their everyday lives to provide security for the inauguration. They have been called up for duty for five previous inaugurations but this was by far their largest such deployment. Their mission was to provide support to the DC Metropolitan Police and they performed admirably. They have my deepest gratitude and appreciation.
It was an absolute outrage that some of these dedicated men and women were forced to sleep in garages at the Capitol the day after the Inauguration. Thankfully, they are no longer being housed there.

President Biden fires NLRB General Counsel Peter Robb in uprecedented move
Here's a huge story that nobody is talking about. President Biden fired National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) General Counsel Peter Robb on the first day of his administration. The NLRB General Counsel has a 4-year Senate confirmed term.
Robb's premature removal by Biden on the first day of his administration is an unprecedented and MAJOR departure from norms. Biden's call for unity was swiftly followed by divisive and purely political actions. By prematurely firing Robb, Biden broke presidential tradition to install one of his Big Labor cronies – becoming the first president to EVER fire an NLRB General Counsel. If President Trump had done this to President Obama's NLRB General Counsel, you'd think the world was ending by the inflammatory reactions you would've seen in the mainstream media. But instead, when a Democrat makes a completely unprecedented move, the D.C. press corps writes a sublime story tacitly approving of it and moves on. Our national press is hopelessly broken and are more embarrassing and subversive every day.

Saving tax dollars in my office budget
As a fiscal conservative who worries about our mounting national debt, I reject the ""use it or lose it"" mentality with which most people view taxpayer money in Washington, D.C. At the end of the 116th Congress, despite it being my first year in office with significant startup costs, I returned $160,000 of the money allotted to me during the term back to taxpayers.
Our office and staff have committed to being good stewards of the taxpayer’s money. Congress’ job is to write the laws of the land in the most efficient way possible. If every federal legislator and bureaucrat had this perspective, we could significantly ease the burden of our massive national debt on our children and grandchildren.

Voting against Gen. Lloyd's active service waiver
￼
On Thursday, the House of Representatives passed legislation providing a waiver for Gen. Lloyd Austin III, who retired from the Army in 2016, to serve as Secretary of Defense. Federal law presently requires former service members to be civilians for at least seven years before they can head the Department of Defense. I voted against providing the waiver.
Gen. Austin has a decorated and very impressive record serving our great country – I did not oppose it because I take issue with his career. I also do not oppose retired generals playing a political role in our government. Many of the greatest statesmen in American history have served in our military and I know that will continue to be the case in the future.
That said, given the civilian structure of the leadership in our government, I believe it’s important for retired service members to take a step back and see the world through the lens of a civilian before they lead the entirety of our military as Secretary of Defense. I believe the passage of this waiver today continues to set a bad precedent for our military and the country at large.

Getting my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine
￼
This week I received my second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. As I have recommended before, I took a non steroidal (Ibuprofen) just prior to the injection. I think it helps with any discomfort or side effects. I would like to encourage all eligible individuals to take the vaccine as soon as you get the chance. I understand the state has had distribution challenges but hopefully they will work through them and increase availability very soon.
I will give one example. If one only takes half of an antibiotic prescribed for an infection, the infection can develop resistance and never heal. A similar scenario can happen with vaccinations also. If only a small amount of our population gets vaccinated, it gives the virus a greater chance to mutate and hinders the chance of eradicating the virus. So please seriously consider getting vaccinated.
You can find out if you're eligible to get the shot and where you can get it by clicking the picture above!

President Biden's inaugauration 
￼
Last Wednesday, America demonstrated that even in the most divisive of times, we are committed to carrying on the tradition of a peaceful transfer of power. I wish President Biden the best of luck during these next four years. It is my prayer that this nation heals and thrives in the upcoming years.
President Biden’s speech, in a vacuum, was, in words, a unifying message that the country needed. Unfortunately, however, his divisive executive actions today completely cut against the warm rhetoric, particularly his decision to rescind the Keystone XL Pipeline’s permit. This needless action will crush thousands of jobs and will not serve to help the environment in any meaningful way. So many environmental safeguards have already been agreed to and were in place. We had a good place that balanced environmental concerns and energy self-dependence. 
Taking a pipeline away doesn’t make anyone drive their car less or heat our homes less. The U.S. has led the world the last decade in cutting greenhouse emissions. Led the world. Instead, these actions will only lead to increase our dependence on oil from foreign countries like Venezuela and Saudi Arabi who do not share the U.S. and Canada’s commitment to cleaner energy. These actions are good for symbolism, but the only true result will be the loss of jobs and the creation of more government dependency.
In addition, President Biden’s proposed COVID-19 relief package, which incentivizes people not to get back to work, highlights the radical direction in which I am afraid he intends to take this country. We need to get people back to work. Employers are begging for workers to come back. It is totally absurd that now some will be paid more to sit at home and collect a government check rather than go back to work and help themselves and the economy. If these and similar actions are what we are to expect from this new administration, we will reverse trends we have enjoyed of great economic growth and personal independence to substitute them for economic stagnation and government dependence. I will vigorously oppose a leftward progressive lurch in our country where the government believes that it knows better than that average citizen on how best to run their lives. 

Celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. Day
￼
On Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, we remembered one of the most important political figures in the history of our great nation. Dr. King challenged the United States to make good on the promises of freedom and equality laid out in the Declaration of Independence for ALL Americans, no matter the color of their skin. While there will always be room for improvement, our country is in a much better place today because of his contributions.
One of the things that set Dr. King apart was his desire to unite rather than divide. He knew that in order to win people over to his side of the argument, he needed to treat everyone with compassion rather than vitriol. The 1960s was an extremely tumultuous time period for our country politically, much in the same way as we are experiencing today. During this time of immense political division, we should all take a page out of Dr. King's book and treat one another with kindness.

PPP loan applications are open again!
￼
The Small Business Administration (SBA) has officially reopened the Payroll Protection Program (PPP) thanks to the bipartisan relief package recently passed through Congress. Eligible small businesses can receive full loan forgiveness from the SBA if: 1) employee and compensation levels are maintained, 2) the loan proceeds are spent on payroll costs and other eligible expenses, and 3) at least 60 percent of the proceeds are spent on payroll costs. If you think you might be eligable, please click the picture above to find the application and more information!

President Biden's scattershot stimulus plan
If you actually wanted to create more jobs during this pandemic, then why would you impose a costly $15 minimum wage on small businesses? Raising this wage will bankrupt small businesses. Literally just the opposite of what we need to be doing. This is just another sad example of progressives trying to pass their liberal agenda under the guise of COVID relief.

Opposing impeachment
Since the tragic events at the Capitol on January 6, there has been consensus on both sides of the aisle that we need to heal the painful divide in our country. With barely a week left in his term, President Trump faced impeachment proceedings for the second time. Understandably emotions are running extremely high right now due to the current political climate as well as the devastating effects from the COVID pandemic. That said we still cannot let emotions take over such an important process.
Regardless of how people feel about President Trump, the American justice system demands due process afforded by the Constitution. Impeaching him a week before his term ended unnecessarily poured salt in our nation’s deep wounds. President Trump committed to a smooth transfer of power. We should have just let that happen and worked on uniting the country rather than dividing it further. I strongly oppose this action taken by the House and I strongly oppose the Senate proceeding with an impeachment trial even after Trump has left office.

Dear Friends,

On Wednesday at the inauguration of President Joe Biden, he called for unity among all Americans to ensure success for our nation. I agree. As Americans, we must come together to reconcile our differences and move our country forward.

However, unity does not come by prioritizing policies such as open borders (especially in the age of COVID-19), decimating our oil and gas industries, and granting citizenship to millions of undocumented immigrants. Instead the first priority should be getting Americans back to work, helping small businesses, and getting our children back in school. Learn more about President Biden's first executive actions here.

Our men and women of the National Guard, including many from the Tennessee National Guard, have been bravely stationed around the Capitol complex to keep us safe and protect our democracy. After learning they were asked to vacate the Capitol and relocate outdoors or in the garages, I wrote a letter to Speaker Pelosi demanding answers. Our troops risk their lives every day to defend our nation and they deserve better than this. Thank you to the Tennessee National Guard and all the National Guard for all you do!

Friday marked 48 years since Roe v. Wade. We must all remember that life is precious. I firmly believe in the sanctity of life and our country should always fight for those innocent lives who cannot fight for themselves. That is why I will always proudly be pro-life.

We are in Washington to fight for a better tomorrow for our children, grandchildren, and generations to come. We need to come together to get our economy moving again, support our law enforcement officers, and invest in healthcare and infrastructure.  I look forward to working  on bipartisan solutions to solve Washington’s biggest problems, so future generations will have every opportunity to achieve the American Dream.

Day of Tears Resolution
 
 
Friday was the 48th Anniversary of Roe v. Wade. I continued my fight to protect the lives of the unborn by joining 43 Republican colleagues in introducing H. Res. 58 calling for the United States flag to be flown at half-staff on January 22nd each year to memorialize the unborn.
Since coming to Washington, it has been a priority to protect the lives of the innocent. Our families are the foundation of our country, so I will continue to fight to strengthen America’s families by standing for those who cannot protect themselves.

CONGRESSWOMAN MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR'S WEEKLY UPDATE

This week, we commemorated Martin Luther King Jr. Day, secured much-needed immigration relief for our Venezuelan exile community, inaugurated our new President, kicked-off the City of Miami's mobile vaccination program for seniors, and stood-up for our National Guard when they were expelled from the capitol. I was also selected to serve as an Assistant Whip by Congressman Steve Scalise. 

I look forward to continue addressing your cases, reading your letters, and responding to your comments on Social Media. Please continue to let me know what your thoughts are and never hesitate to reach-out to my office. My team is more than happy to assist you with any of your concerns and guide you through any challenges you may have with our federal agencies. 

It is truly the honor of a lifetime for fight for YOU in the halls of Congress.

WE ADVOCATED FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF D.E.D. FOR OUR VENEZUELAN EXILE COMMUNITY
￼

President Trump established the Deferred Enforced Departure program for our Venezuelan exile community, which allows them to work and stay in the United States without fear of deportation. We have a fundamental obligation to provide safe-haven for those fleeing tyranny and oppression. This act of solidarity provides our Venezuelan exile community with much-needed assurance during these unprecedented times. 

I commend my dear friend and colleague, Congressman Mario Díaz-Balart, for his work with the administration and his unwavering commitment to the plight of the Venezuelan people.

WE JOINED THE KICK-OFF OF THE CITY OF MIAMI'S MOBILE VACCINATION UNIT IN LITTLE HAVANA
￼

I joined Commissioner Joe Carollo, Mayor Francis Suarez, and State Senator Ileana Garcia at La Palma Senior Housing Building in Little Havana for the kick-off of the City of Miami's Mobile Vaccination program for seniors aged 65 and over. 

This program will assist those seniors who do not have access to transportation so that they can receive the COVID vaccine from the comfort of their very own homes. 

MY TEAM DISTRIBUTED CUBAN COFFEE TO OUR NATIONAL GUARD AFTER THEY WERE FORCED OUT OF THE CAPITOL
￼
￼

I was absolutely FLOORED when our brave soldiers were kicked out of the Capitol & told to sleep outside in the cold. I immediately opened my office to our National Guard and my team warmed-up our men & women in uniform with a Miami staple: Cuban coffee. 

It was relieving to know that this decision was later reversed but it was absolutely UNACCEPTABLE and should have never occurred in the first place.

January 24, 2021
 

Dear Neighbor, 

Four years ago, I condemned the actions of many of my Democratic colleagues who boycotted the inauguration of President Trump. I believed then, as I do now, that we have a duty to respect the office of the Presidency despite any political or policy differences we may hold. Our responsibility is to present a unified front during a peaceful transfer of power, and to display an unwavering commitment to the ideals upon which our country was founded.

﻿While President Biden offered words of unity, the actions he has taken since being sworn into office have not lived up to his calls for us to find common ground, which is extremely disappointing. For example, the Biden Administration's actions last week to stop the Keystone pipeline, rejoin the Paris Climate agreement, appease the World Health Organization and stop the removal of those who have entered this country illegally are bad public policy decisions that will only further divide our country. Instead, if he is serious about unity, he should be working in a bipartisan manner to help businesses reopen and to ensure every American who wants a vaccine has access to one. Another unifying measure he could pursue would be to set up a non-partisan electoral commission to ensure the integrity of future elections. All Americans should have confidence when casting their ballots. 

Our nation is facing many immediate challenges, and we need to work together to tackle those issues.  My constituents can be assured that I will continue to defend conservative principles as I work hard to restore our way of life, rebuild our economy, and renew the American dream. 

Please continue reading for some important information.  

Getting Seniors Vaccinated

Last week, I spent several hours on the phone with Members of Florida’s Congressional Delegation and the state leaders who oversee the COVID-19 vaccine distribution process. While I do not have jurisdiction over this process, I did share all the feedback I have received from constituents over the past few weeks and made suggestions for improvements. For example, I am a firm believer that seniors should be able to create an account to register their desire for the vaccine and then be sent an invitation to receive their dose when it is available- rather than having to log on to a website each time a small group of doses become available. The current approach only causes frustration and confusion among many people who already struggle with technology. The state leaders seemed open to implementing this suggestion in the future.

Also, while Florida has received roughly the same amount of doses as other large states (approximately 2 million), our state has gotten far fewer vaccine doses than it needs to provide access to all seniors and those with underlying medical conditions who want the vaccine. Our Congressional delegation committed to working together in a bipartisan manner to advocate for more vaccine to be shipped to Florida. My hope is that we will see significant progress in the coming weeks, as two new vaccines are expected to be approved and production of the two existing vaccines should ramp up even further.

Additionally, the Florida Department of Health has also released this new vaccine tracking tool to share public information on each distribution site throughout the state. 

Local Updates

The Pasco County Health Department has a new way to pre-register for COVID-19 vaccine. Register so you are ready when new appointment slots open. I am told new slots for this coming week will be released today at 2:00 p.m. The county will only be accepting registered patients with an appointment at all vaccine locations, and at this time slots are reserved for seniors over the age of 65.   

Pinellas County is also using a new registration system for vaccine distribution and expects to receive more doses next week. Click here to learn more. 

In Hillsborough County, a new drive-thru vaccination site for seniors and frontline health care workers opened at University Mall, 2200 E. Fowler Ave. in Tampa. The vaccination site is expected to operate seven days a week based on vaccine supply. Appointments are mandatory. No walk-ups will be accepted. Priority for appointments is being given to those individuals ages 65 and older who previously created an account to schedule a vaccination at one of the county’s other sites, but who were unable to secure a reservation. These people are being directly contacted by the state-contracted appointment call center to determine if they would like to be vaccinated at the University Mall location. For more information on how to register, please visit the Hillsborough County Health Department. 
 

Protecting Consumers

Last week, I was named the Lead Republican on the Consumer Protection and Commerce (CPC) Subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The jurisdiction of this important subcommittee includes: consumer protection, interstate and foreign commerce, data security, privacy matters, product safety and liability, motor vehicle safety and the regulation of commercial activity including: sports-related matters, travel, tourism, and time.

In this new leadership role, I will work to protect all Americans from predatory scams, investigate potential social media monopolies, encourage and spur innovation of emerging technologies, and defend against security breaches involving sensitive consumer data. This position also provides a unique opportunity to help the travel and tourism industry - which is vital to Florida’s economy and job market - as it seeks to fully rebound from the global pandemic. As always, my constituents can be assured that I will remain focused on ensuring quality and affordable healthcare options for all Americans and that I will never stop advocating for our nation’s heroes, as well as seniors and the disabled. I look forward to working with my colleagues on these important priorities.
 
 

Fighting for and Honoring Our Heroes

I was glad to see last week’s Executive Order by President Trump which acknowledged the toxic conditions our heroes faced while stationed at K2. This action can help pave the way for these Veterans to access the benefits and care they deserve, which is something I have and will continue to fight for in Congress. 
 

Last week marked the 30th Anniversary of Operation Desert Storm. More than 2.2 million U.S. service members served during this era, with 694,550 deployed to the Gulf. There were 299 U.S. military casualties, and many survivors returned home suffering from undiagnosed illnesses, now commonly known as Gulf War Syndrome. As with Veterans of all theaters, I salute the service and sacrifice of the brave men and women who served as part of this mission. I remain committed to ensuring our Gulf War Veterans and Veterans of all eras receive the care and benefits they deserve.
 

Heroes take on many forms. Throughout this pandemic, the tireless efforts of our healthcare workers have been nothing short of heroic. I am glad to see the NFL honoring their service by inviting them to participate in this year's Super Bowl festivities in Tampa. Hopefully, they will be able to cheer on the hometown team! Go Bucs! 
 
 

Providing Relief to Small Businesses

The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) is now re-opened for small businesses to apply for a first round of funding (up to $10 million). Small Businesses that experienced significant financial loss during the pandemic can also now apply for a second loan (up to $2 million). Small Business Owners can apply for these funds through any participating lender. Visit SBA.gov to learn more. 

The Florida Community Loan Fund (FCLF) is also pleased to provide access to PPP loans to Florida nonprofit organizations and small businesses.

• Its PPP focus is on nonprofit organizations based in Florida.
• Small businesses can also access PPP through FCLF’s network.
• You do not need to be an existing FCLF borrower to apply.
• There is no minimum loan size – FCLF wants all eligible PPP borrowers to have access.

FCLF staff is on hand and ready to answer questions about the program and coach applicants through the process. Click here to learn more. 
 
 

Constituent Corner

I recently received this message from a constituent who is also a Veteran.

Just wanted to drop you a note to say thanks for the help with dealing with DFAS. After hitting dead-end after dead-end and the worst customer support I've ever seen, I may see a solution coming. I've been trying to resolve a military retired pay division problem for over a year. The frustration was unbelievable. 

Within a week of asking for Congressman  Bilirakis's office for help I received a call from an attorney at DFAS. She was very polite and above all very helpful!. It's a shame retirees can't get that kind of support without asking for Congressional help. I'm very thankful your team takes constituent services seriously. Keep up the great work and fight the good fight. 
\

This is just one example of the work we do each day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!

Sincerely,
 

Gus Bilirakis
Member of Congress

INAUGURATION 

President Trump spent the last four years fighting for our great nation. I thank him for his service, and I'm proud of what we accomplished. 

This week, Joe Biden was sworn in as President of the United States and the world witnessed the peaceful transition of power. Now more than ever, America needs unity to address the many challenges we face. 

Unfortunately, as soon as the President was sworn-in, he signed executive orders to revoke the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, weaken our border security and more. Crushing the progress made over the last four years will threaten American jobs and further divide our nation.

I am committed to finding common ground to move our country forward, and I call on the new Administration to do the same. 

We discuss the inauguration and this week in Washington on this episode of Buddy's Briefing.

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCXCVI

Monday, January 18, 2021:  On Saturday I attended the funeral of Ware County Sheriff Randy Royal who died at the young age of 57 last week.  Sheriff Royal started his law enforcement career in 1980 as a dispatcher at the sheriff’s office and worked his way up to being elected Sheriff in 2009 and re-elected to a fourth four-year term last November.  One of the true nice guys, Sheriff Royal’s funeral was attended by numerous law enforcement officers and a number of sheriffs in the region who worked with him.  A lifelong resident of Ware County, Sheriff Royal loved the community and the community loved him.  He will be greatly missed.  Today we celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.  While most of the parades have been cancelled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of virtual celebrations are held throughout the First District.  Dr. King visited the First District many times during his life and was particularly fond of Savannah.  A link to a video honoring Dr. King’s birthday can be found here.  This morning, I have a briefing with the Chief of the National Guard Bureau on preparations for the Presidential Inauguration later this week.  Because of the COVID-19 pandemic and heightened security, this inauguration will be much different from those in the past.  Later in the day, I have a virtual interview with WSB-TV in Atlanta to discuss the upcoming inauguration and my plans to attend.  A link to my interview can be found here.

Tuesday, January 19, 2021:  After our daily all-staff conference call, I head to the airport for my flight to Washington and have a press conference with local media to discuss my attendance at the inauguration as well as other issues.  A link to my interviews can be found here and here.  Once in Washington, I head to the Pentagon with my special guest as we are required to have a COVID-19 test in order to gain admission to the event tomorrow.  Once I arrive at the Capitol, I am greeted by eight foot fences with razor wire at the top surrounding the Capitol with thousands of National Guard troops and Capitol Hill Police monitoring the grounds.  While the heightened security is understandable as a result of the events of January 6, the optics are certainly alarming.   

Wednesday, January 20, 2021:  I’m on the radio early this morning with my good friend Bill Edwards on NewsTalk 1290 as we discuss the inauguration and the events of January 6th.  Later, I meet my special guest for the inauguration, Dr. Karla Sapp, outside the gates and escort her into the Capitol.  Born and raised in Midway in Liberty County, I met Dr. Sapp while she was working with the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) in Jesup in Wayne County where she was the coordinator of the drug rehabilitation program. 
￼
Rep. Carter at the inauguration with his guest Dr. Karla Sapp
Dr. Sapp is a licensed professional counselor and was named the 2020 Mental Health Advocate of the Year by the Black Mental Health Symposium.  Mental health issues are one of our primary focuses on the Health Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce (E&C) Committee that I serve on in Congress.  After checking in with other members of Congress and their guests, Dr. Sapp and I are escorted to the western lawn of the Capitol where we are led to our seats.  While waiting for the ceremony to begin, Dr. Sapp and I meet other members of Congress and their guests and she is able to renew acquaintances with members of her sorority, Delta Sigma Theta.  The weather is frigid with even a few light snow flurries, but the atmosphere is exciting as we witness the swearing in of the 46th President of the United States, Joe Biden, and the first African American and Asian American female Vice-President, Kamala Harris.  Along with the pomp and pageantry, we also witness performances by Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez and Garth Brooks.  The event is a success, without incident and certainly one that Dr. Sapp and I will remember for many years.  Later, I have a virtual interview with WJCL-TV in Savannah followed by a virtual interview with Fox 28 in Savannah to discuss my inaugural experiences.  A link to my interviews can be found here and here.  

Thursday, January 21, 2021:  My morning starts with an interview on C-SPAN as I discuss the inauguration and COVID-19 vaccine rollout as well as other topics.  A link to my interview can be found here.  Afterwards, I head to the Capitol Visitors Center (CVC) for a GOP organizing meeting of the E&C Committee where we receive our subcommittee assignments for the session. 
￼
Rep. Carter appears on C-SPAN
Once again, I will be serving on the Health and Environment & Climate Change Subcommittees and this session, I will be adding the Communications and Technology Subcommittee.  These are great assignments and I am excited and eager to begin.  Afterwards, I head back to my office where I join in on our daily all-staff conference call before heading to the western lawn of the Capitol where they are beginning to dismantle the inauguration platform and where I film this week’s edition of Buddy’s Briefing.  After returning to my office, I head to the House Chamber where I speak on the upcoming waiver vote for Gen. Lloyd Austin.  Gen. Austin, a Thomasville, GA, native and former member of the 3rd ID, has been nominated for Secretary of Defense, a position that requires a former military member to be retired for seven years.  Because Gen. Austin has only been retired four years, he must have a waiver in order to be eligible.  A link to my speech in favor of granting the waiver to Gen. Austin can be found here.  Afterwards, I remain in the House Chamber for the vote where Gen. Austin is granted the waiver.  Next, I head to the airport for my return trip home. 

Friday, January 22, 2021:  After a phone interview with a reporter from the Coastal Courier in Hinesville to discuss my experiences at the inauguration, I head to our Savannah office where I meet with a constituent concerning the November election before meeting with a group of supporters of the Fair Tax legislation that I am sponsoring this session. 
￼

Afterwards, I film a pro-life video before heading out and ending what has been a very busy week.

Since January 6, many on the Left and in the media have claimed that I: ·      organized the peaceful rally of January 6,  ·      planned the unlawful riots that took place,  ·      led reconnaissance tours of the U.S. Capitol to those scheming to riot,  ·      funded the rally and the riot. All of those allegations are false. I have publicly denied all them, of course. And I believed that when they heard the truth, honest reporters would stop writing untruths. I was wrong. The reality is that there are few honest reporters remaining, and Leftists do not care about truth. For them, the ends justify the means. The media has buried my statements, ignored the evidence, and is instead generating ever-more-sensational lies about me. I am writing this to speak directly to my constituents, and to the few remaining honest journalists who aren’t quite sure what to believe.  Here are unequivocal answers to the questions an honest press would have asked: 1.     Did you in any way organize, plan, or fund the January 6, 2021 rally that was held on the Ellipse of the White House? No. 2.     Did you participate at, speak at, pray at, sing at, or attend the January 6, 2021 rally? No. 3.     Did you give tours of the U.S. Capitol to individuals or groups who were planning to breach the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021? No. 4.     Have you given tours of the U.S. Capitol to anyone or any group since the November 3, 2020 election? No. 5.     Were you aware of any planned demonstration or riot at the U.S. Capitol to take place after the rally on January 6, 2021? No. 6.     Did you in any way help organize or plan the breach of the U.S. Capitol and ensuing riot of January 6, 2021? No. 7.     Have you had phone, text, social media, or email contact with the individual, Ali Alexander, who originally claimed that you helped plan the rally of January 6, 2021? No. 8.     Did you help plan with Mr. Alexander either the rally or the riot of January 6, 2021? No. 9.     Why would Mr. Alexander claim that you, and two other congressmen, “schemed up of putting maximum pressure on Congress while they were voting?” I have no idea. In sum: All of the allegations are false.  I do not know why the rumors started, why the media has repeatedly ignored the evidence, or how to state the truth more clearly.  This assault on my reputation is difficult to watch. The Left’s lies have resulted in death threats against my family and me, as well as several other conservative Members of Congress who’ve been similarly defamed.   This situation is typical of many false news stories that the press “reported” against former President Trump, the most famous of which was the Russia hoax. For years, the President had to respond to something that was pure fabrication, and several of my colleagues and I are in the same position now. Once the Leftists in the media generate a false narrative, it is so hard to prove a negative. I am deeply grateful for the friends, supporters, and constituents who have seen through the yarns spun by the press and sent me well wishes and notes of support. My reputation as an honest man, who believes in this country and the rule of law, has been deliberately tainted by people who have no regard for the truth. I do not know when or if they will tire of their lies and sensational reporting. In the meantime, I will continue telling the truth and fighting for the American values that are vital to my constituents. I ask that you look past the false stories and instead consider the evidence for yourself.

Rep. Gosar demands congressional hearing to uncover why men and women of the United States National Guard were forced to vacate the United States Capitol
 
 
WASHINGTON D.C. Congressman Paul Gosar sent a letter to the Committee on House Administration Chairwoman Zoe Lofgren and Ranking Member Rodney Davis formally requesting the Committee convene a hearing to examine why men and women of the United States National Guard were forced to vacate the U.S. Capitol, resulting in one National Guard unit being relegated to a nearby parking garage without internet reception and having only one bathroom for approximately 5,000 troops.
 
""It is a sad state of affairs when our men and women in uniform have better accommodations overseas than they do on the grounds of the U.S. Capitol. This is not how we treat our nation's heroes. Apologies are owed,"" said Congressman Gosar. 
 
Rep. Gosar is seeking accountability for whomever gave this directive and more information as to why the request was made in the first place.

Dear Friend,

On Wednesday, Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th President of the United States. In his inaugural address, he pledged unity, stating, “I will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did.” Those are fine words, but the proof is always in the pudding. We got our answer a few short hours later. President Biden went into the oval office and with the stroke of a pen fired tens of thousands of Americans, prioritized illegal immigrants over American citizens, and weakened our national security. And that was just Day One. As I watched these actions, it made me even more appreciative of all we accomplished working in partnership with President Trump.

After years of leading from behind, America last became America First. Over the past four years, our country’s economy has flourished thanks to reduced regulations, lower taxes, more energy independence, and improved trade deals that prioritize American workers. The forgotten men and women of this country were forgotten no more...KEEP READING HERE

WHAT'S GREAT IN THE 8TH 

￼

Nine students recently completed the paramedic program at Mineral Area College. This year, more than ever, we saw the importance of the great work our frontline workers do. I extend my thanks each of the graduates for their hard work and dedication to the health and safety of Southern Missouri.

￼

For the third time in four years, Jerry Cox of Cape Girardeau won the Missouri Soybean Association's high-yield contest. He earned the honor of overall best soybean crop with an irrigated field that averaged just less than 103 bushels per acre- the state average being 49 bushels per acre. Congratulations Jerry, what a great example of Southern Missouri's bountiful agriculture industry.

￼

Jenny Summers and Katie James, both Salem High School graduates, grew close after going through the kidney donation process together. In just a few weeks, Katie will give selflessly to help Jenny live out the rest of her life with a healthy kidney.

￼

The Youth Conservation Corps program is opening applications for young adults in Southern Missouri who are interested in working to keep our Mark Twain National Forest pristine. YCC is a paid summer work program for youth, designed to develop an understanding and appreciation of the environment.



 IN CASE YOU MISSED IT

￼

This week, I wrote a letter to House Appropriations chair Rosa DeLauro, requesting she help remove wasteful spending from the latest coronavirus package. It is our responsibility to ensure hard-earned taxpayer dollars are used for programs that directly benefit the American people.

￼

On his first day in the Oval Office, Mr. Biden signed an executive order undoing all the progress made by the last administration to ensure the security of our southern border. Our new President has proved he is more interested in granting citizenship to illegal immigrants than helping Americans get back to work.

Dear Friends, 
 
I’ve always opposed capital punishment. It’s wrong for a state or the federal government to take a life.
 
There is no justification other than sheer vengeance and innocent people are too often wrongfully sentenced to death. 
 
The Justice Project found that 123 people were exonerated and released from death row since the death penalty was reinstated in the 1970s. Capital punishment is also applied unfairly and disproportionally to people of color, low-income people, and those with mental health conditions. Wealthy people who can afford expert lawyers are rarely sentenced to die. 
 
The death penalty is particularly ineffective in deterring future crimes. In fact, states with the most executions also have the highest murder rates. People who commit murder rarely think about being caught, let alone what the punishment for their crimes would be. 
 
And not only is the death penalty unfair, inequitable, and ineffective – it is also incredibly expensive and time-consuming.
 
Of the string of executions conducted in the final days of the Trump administration, the murder of Lisa Montgomery, the first woman in nearly 70 years to be executed, was particularly horrifying. She was subject to abuse and torture much of her life, which exacerbated her mental health condition and left her with no comprehension of what was happening to her. It was just one more shameful episode in the legacy of Trump.
 
I am urging President Biden to end the barbaric practice of federal executions and commute the sentences of all those on federal death row. You can read my letter to him here.
 
Congress must also act. We must formally abolish the death penalty, which is why I support the Federal Death Penalty Prohibition Act.
 
It is time to stop the carnage of the death penalty. 
  
Courage,
￼

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
JANUARY 23, 2021

'Women's Sports Should Be Women's Sports' Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Cosponsors the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act

Washington D.C. – This week, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene took a stand for women and girls in America by originally cosponsoring Rep. Greg Steube's Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act to prohibit men from unfairly competing against women in sports. 

This legislation would enact Title IX protection to recognize the sex of athletes at birth and stop the dangerous trend of biological males infiltrating women's sports to achieve a competitive advantage.

Congresswoman Greene issued the following statement:

""As a former competitive athlete and a mother to a daughter who is a D1 collegiate athlete, I staunchly oppose biological males in girls/women’s sports, locker rooms, and bathrooms. 

This completely violates women’s rights in every way. Women's sports should be women's sports.""

The full text of the legislation can be read here.

1/23/21 12:08,Weekly Wrap-Up: Moving Forward,"￼

Dear Lindsey,
 
This week, I witnessed our new Commander in Chief take the oath of office and got right to work for the people of the Seventh District. I reintroduced a bill to reduce corruption in Congress, introduced legislation to protect hard earned Social Security benefits, reintroduced a bill to crack down on foreign-backed disinformation campaigns in our political system, and continued to speak out against extremist ideologies. Please keep reading for more details and thank you, as always, for the honor of serving our district.
  
 
WHAT I'M WORKING ON
 
  
This Thursday, I reintroduced my TRUST in Congress Act to prevent insider trading by Members of Congress and strengthen transparency in government. This bipartisan legislation reduces the opportunity for Members of the House and Senate to profit off their influence and access to information by requiring them to put certain investment assets into a blind trust while in office, ensuring that lawmakers are serving their constituents, not themselves. READ MORE
 
I also reintroduced a bipartisan bill to require that disclaimers labeling foreign-backed political content on social media be attached to the post itself. We must be on guard against adversaries who hope to put misinformation, propaganda, and lies in front of Americans. Ensuring that disclaimers remain on such posts as they are shared or linked better equips us all to recognize the origins of information, strengthening our democracy for the better. READ MORE
 
This week, I introduced the Social Security Fairness Act to make sure public employees receive the full Social Security benefits they've earned from private sector work. Many Central Virginians who work more than one job in both the public and private sectors or are the spouse of a government employee have their benefits reduced or eliminated. This bipartisan bill would get rid of the provisions of the Social Security Act that cause these unfair reductions. READ MORE
 
Since this month's insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, I have repeatedly stressed the importance of confronting white nationalism and violent extremism head-on. If we are not united in aggressively working to fight against these ideologies, we allow them to continue to pose a threat far beyond the attack on the U.S. Capitol.
  
 
￼
 
  
 
A NEW ADMINISTRATION
 
  
On January 20, I had the honor of representing Virginia's Seventh District at the inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. The day brought with it an overwhelming sense of optimism and hope for the unity of our nation. I am eager to work with this new administration as we deliver on the issues that are most important to Central Virginia.
  
￼
  
 
IN OUR DISTRICT
 
  
Our constituent services team is here to assist anyone in the Seventh District who's having issues with a federal agency like Social Security, Medicare, or the VA. We are committed to getting you the fair treatment and answers you deserve.
 
Since taking office in January 2019, my team has closed 1,758 constituent cases and returned $4,463,717 in backlogged benefits to Central Virginians.
 
To open a case, complete this form online or call us at (804) 401-4110.
 
It is important that I hear from you so I can best represent my Seventh District neighbors, which is why my team has held 1,031 events since entering office. Thank you to all of you who have shared your priorities with me.
  
FIND A COVID-19 TESTING SITE NEAR YOU
  
￼
  
On Thursday, I had the privilege of meeting with members of the Virginia National Guard as they continue to protect our nation's capital. It was an honor to speak with them, and I am so grateful for their commitment to defending our democratic republic.
  
 
TAX TIPS: AVOID IRS DELAYS
 
  
As tax season approaches, we want to help you be as prepared as possible to file your federal tax return. The Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) Richmond office is hosting a virtual pre-filing season awareness event via Zoom on Wednesday, January 27 at 2pm. They will be sharing tax tips to avoid IRS delays and make the process easy. If you have a specific question about your tax records, their staff will also be holding secure one-on-one breakout sessions to provide the information you need. Click HERE for details.
 

 
One more thing: this past year was undoubtedly hard. 2020 presented more challenges and tremendous hardships than I could ever list. However, I am going into 2021 fighting for all my neighbors in the Seventh District and am incredibly hopeful that this year will be more prosperous than the last.
 
As we continue to weather the storm that is the coronavirus pandemic and begin to get our communities back on track, I want to remind you once more that my team and I are here to serve you. If you need help, related to COVID-19 or not, call my office at (804) 401-4110 or (202) 225-2815. The work continues, and we are in this together. Always.
  
Sincerely,
Abigail

1/23/21 12:03,Rep. Grothman Newsletter- Keystone XL,"￼

 
Keystone XL Pipeline
 
Joe Biden ran his campaign with the promise to govern as a moderate, but he broke that promise on the first day of his Presidency with the radical step of shutting down construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. This is a sad day for working Americans and a sad day for those who believed they voted for a moderate President.
 
Upon completion, the Keystone XL pipeline would transport 830,000 barrels of oil per day, lowering the price of gas at the pump, and support 11,000 U.S. jobs. Hundreds of those jobs existed here in Wiscosnin and many of them have already received notice that they have been laid-off as a direct result of President Biden shutting down construction of the pipeline. This is a textbook example of coastal elites making decisions that to them are theoretical, but have a real-life negative impact to us midwesterners. 
 
One of the key criticisms of the pipeline is its impact on the environment, but studies show that pipelines are ""without a doubt the safest way to transport oil and gas"", so the decision to remove the Keystone XL pipeline from the equation will actually hurt the environment. The Canadian oil is still going to be transported to the U.S., but now it will be transported less safely by rail and truck.
 
I and my colleagues Mike Gallagher (WI-08), Bryan Steil (WI-01), Tom Tiffany (WI-07) and Scott Fitzgerald (WI-05) sent this letter to President Biden expressing our support for completion of the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and letting him know that terminiting the project will come at a high cost to Wisconsinites.
￼
I also Joined Congressman Steil and Congressman Fitzgerald on Friday for a press conference to discuss the benefits of completing the Keystone XL pipeline, President Biden’s decision to halt its construction, dispel common misconceptions and speak to why completing the pipeline is an important project for both the U.S. and Canada. We spoke from the Franksville jobsite of Michels Corporation, who was awarded a contract to help build the pipeline, where we met workers whose jobs will be affected by the President's terrible decision.

WI National Guard in DC
 
The National Guard from all 50 states and three U.S. territories have done an outstanding job over the last few weeks protecting the U.S. Capitol and making sure the inauguration ceremony ran smoothly. Thank you to these brave men and women who serve our country!
 
I visited the Wisconsin National Guard members who were in Washington, DC on Thursday to thank them for their service.
  
￼
  
￼
  
I also sent a letter to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi applauding the success achieved by the National Guardsmen and women who came to Washington, DC and urged them to reward these servicemembers with tour of the Capitol building. It would be unfortunate, particularly for those who travelled from a long distance, to only see the U.S. Capitol from the outside and not be able to see the inside.
 
Click here to read the full letter.
  
 
Travelling Internationally?
 
Due to COVID-19 guidelines, international travelers coming into the United States will be required to obtain a negative COVID text before entering the U.S. This includes U.S. citizens. If you are abroad or soon plan to travel outside of the country, please make sure you take the necessary steps to re-enter. You can find more information from the CDC by clicking here.
  
 
Be Your Real ID Self
 
Beginning October 1, 2021, in order to fly within the U.S., visit a military base or other federal building, Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers will require your identification to be REAL ID-compliant. The goal of the new DHS public awareness campaign, “Be Your Real ID Self,” is to ensure all people are who they claim to be.
 
The key feature to make a Wisconsin ID REAL ID-compliant is that it marked with a µ in the upper-right hand corner. Non-compliant cards state “NOT FOR FEDERAL PURPOSES” in that same space. At this time, Wisconsin offers both REAL ID-compliant and non-compliant driver licenses and ID cards. Be mindful of this distinction because they look similar.
 
If you aren’t sure your driver’s license or ID card is REAL ID-compliant, you can check here.
 
I urge you to obtain a REAL ID-compliant card prior to the October 1, 2021 deadline. Just over 8 months remain until the REAL ID full enforcement deadline goes into effect at all federally regulated airports, federal facilities, and nuclear power plants.
 
Valid U.S. passports, or another acceptable form of federal identification, can be used in place of a REAL ID-compliant card. Click here for more information on Transportation Safety Administration approved documents.
  
 
Weekly Roundup
 
Religious freedom is a right, but some around the world still suffer persecution. In August of last year, I ""adopted"" Pastor A Dao, a Vietnamese prisoner of conscience who was wrongfully imprisoned for his Christian beliefs. Thankfully, a month after I ""adopted"" Pastor Dao, his sentence was commuted and he is once again free to practice his faith. Last Saturday was religious freedom Day, and stories like this give me hope for a future where everyone throughout the world can safely and freely practice their faith.
  
￼
  
Thanks to Church Health Services for showing me your new facilities and how you are keeping Beaver Dam residents safe and healthy during COVID-19.
  
￼
  
Every human life is sacred gift from God. Friday was National Sanctity of Human Life Day, where I reaffirmed my commitment to protect and cherish every person, whether born or unborn, young or old, healthy or sick.
 
“Speak up for those who can’t speak for themselves” — Proverbs 31:8
  
￼
  
I was also pleased to share that I received an A+ rating from the pro-life organization Susan B. Anthony List for my work to protect life in the 116th Congress. I will always work to protect the lives of the unborn and stop your tax dollars from going to organizations that provide abortions.

January 23, 2021


PRESIDENT BIDEN’S DAY 1 DISASTER
On Day 1 of his Administration, President Biden signed 17 executive actions including:   • Rescinding the permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline; • Rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement; • Halting construction of the border wall; • A mask mandate on federal property; • Stopping the withdrawal from the World Health Organization; and • Requiring non-citizens to be included in the Census and apportionment of congressional seats.  
 Additionally, the Biden Interior Department put a 60-day ban on oil and gas leases on federal lands and waters. It was no secret President Biden planned to destroy the oil and gas industry if elected president and in the first days of his administration, he’s taken actions to do just that. These moves only make us more dependent on foreign oil and increase prices for American families, not to mention eliminate good-paying jobs in the middle of a pandemic.
 
During his inaugural address, President Biden promised to work for all Americans, but that’s not what these actions do. I strongly urge the Biden Administration to reconsider.
 
I WILL ALWAYS STAND UP FOR LIFE

 I was honored to attend the reenlistment ceremony for Sgt Cristian Cepeda on Friday. Sgt Cepeda has been a friend of mine and Christie's for the past two years. Thank you, Sgt Cepeda, for your continued service to our country.   PPP 2.0 
￼
 
The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) 2.0 is up and running! This program is a lifeline for small businesses who have been impacted by the pandemic, including more than 66,000 Oklahoma small businesses. Last year, the original PPP saved more than 50 million jobs across the country.
 
Loans will be available until March 31, 2021 or until the money runs out, whichever is sooner. You can apply through any existing SBA 7(a) lender or through any federally insured depository institution, federally insured credit union, and Farm Credit System institution that is participating. Other regulated lenders will be available to make these loans once they are approved and enrolled in the program. You should consult with your local lender as to whether it is participating in the program.

The correct answer will be right here, in my weekly e-newsletter.

Dear friends and neighbors,

This week, we began a new era in our nation’s history as President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were sworn in.  
￼

Amanda Soto, Rep Soto, Rep Murphy, Rep Demings and Mayor Demings

Hours after taking the oath of office, President Biden took a historic number of actions to deliver immediate relief for families across America. He has implemented numerous executive actions changing the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, providing economic relief, tackling climate change and advancing racial equity.  

On day one, President Biden signed executive orders to: 

	•	Boost Vaccine Production and Distribution
	•	Implement a 100-day Mask Challenge
	•	Rejoin the World Health Organization (WHO)
	•	Extend Eviction and Foreclosure Moratoriums
	•	Rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement 
	•	Extend Student Loan Pause
	•	Preserve DACA
	•	Reverse Census Order Excluding Undocumented Immigrants from the Reapportionment Count
	•	Revoke the Muslim Ban
	•	Extend Student Loan Forbearance

Together, the Democratic White House, Democratic House of Representatives and Democratic Senate will work to not only recover from the devastating pandemic and economic crisis – we will Build Back Better. 

COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution in the District

As COVID-19 infections rise in Central Florida, we are working with local officials to provide up-to-date information on vaccinations. For more information on your county's distribution plans, please visit the websites linked below. 

Orange County

Osceola County
Polk County


(305) 351-9531 


(866) 779-6121

(863) 298-7500 

Demand for the COVID-19 vaccine is far in excess of the supply the state has received so far. It is anticipated that additional supplies will be coming soon. Florida has many sites that are providing COVID-19 vaccines to eligible persons. The state is prioritizing persons 65 years of age and older and health care personnel with direct patient contact and residents and staff of long-term care facilities. Please be aware that some locations are only serving very specific populations, such as frontline health care workers. Appointments may be required and vaccine availability will vary from day to day and week to week, as we work to provide vaccines to the most vulnerable first. 
FULL LIST OF VACCINE SITES
￼

In the face of unprecedented challenges, Central Floridians in our community have shown immense courage. From the heroic efforts of our healthcare workers and first responders to our essential workers and teachers, each of you has helped our community get through the coronavirus crisis. In the spirit of the holiday season, I want to thank you. From my family to yours: may you stay safe, stay healthy and have a wonderful and joyful holiday! 

In Community,

Rob’s Rundown: Week of January 18 – January 22, 2021 
Senator Portman was back in Washington this week as the Senate reconvened to consider several of President Biden’s cabinet nominees. On Wednesday, Portman attended the Inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and issued a statement congratulating the new President and Vice President.  
On Tuesday, Portman participated in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee confirmation hearing for Alejandro Mayorkas, President Biden’s nominee to serve as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Portman pressed Mr. Mayorkas on the 2013 DHS Inspector General report which found that he granted special access to politically connected Democrats and mistreated agency employees. Mr. Mayorkas committed to addressing cybersecurity threats from foreign actors, stopping the influx of deadly synthetic drugs at the southern border and through the U.S. Postal Service, ensuring that faith-based organizations and nonprofits are secured against threats through FEMA’s Nonprofit Security Grant Program, strengthening the E-Verify program in an effort to make it more effective, and combatting human trafficking.
Later that afternoon, during the Senate Finance Committee hearing, Portman pressed Dr. Janet Yellen, nominee to serve as Secretary of the Treasury, about the long-term economic impact of the nation’s surging deficit and how we can begin to get back on a path towards greater fiscal stewardship. Yellen committed to Portman that she would be a voice for fiscal sanity and stated, “I completely agree with you, Senator Portman, that the Treasury Secretary has to be a voice for fiscal sanity, and I pledge to do that. Our finances need to be on a sustainable, long-run course. And that’s very important for us to focus on. I pledge to do that.""  
During the Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing - which also took place on Tuesday - Portman secured commitments from President Biden’s nominee for Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, to support the efforts of the Global Engagement Center (GEC) to effectively combat disinformation and propaganda from foreign actors, like Russia and China.  
Finally, Portman delivered remarks on the Senate floor Thursday afternoon expressing his gratitude for the men and women of the United States Capitol Police, the U.S. Secret Service, and the U.S. National Guard who defended the Capitol during the inauguration of President Biden and Vice President Harris in the wake of the violent mob that stormed the building on January 6. Portman also mourned the loss of USCP officers Brian Sicknick, who was killed in the attack, and Howard Liebengood, who died shortly after.  
For a more detailed look at Senator Portman’s week, please see the following:

Portman Presses DHS Secretary Nominee Mayorkas on Granting Special Access to Politically Connected Democrats and Mistreatment of Agency Employees at HSGAC Hearing 
Portman pressed Alejandro Mayorkas, nominee to serve as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, on the 2013 DHS Inspector General report which found that Mayorkas granted special access to politically connected Democrats and mistreated agency employees in his opening remarks at the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on the nomination.
A transcript of Senator Portman’s opening statement can be found here and a video can be found here. 
Portman Secures Commitment from DHS Secretary Nominee to Address Cybersecurity, Stop Influx of Deadly Drugs, and Protect Faith-Based Organizations
Portman secured commitments from Alejandro Mayorkas, nominee to serve as Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, to address cybersecurity threats from foreign actors; stop the influx of deadly synthetic drugs at the southern border and through the U.S. Postal Service; ensure that faith-based organizations and nonprofits are secured against threats through FEMA’s Nonprofit Security Grant Program; strengthen the E-Verify program in an effort to make it more effective; and combat human trafficking. 
Last year, Senators Portman and Gary Peters (D-MI) announced they will build upon their bipartisan cybersecurity work by holding hearings and work on bipartisan comprehensive cybersecurity legislation in response to the SolarWinds breach. Portman asked Mayorkas to ensure the entire government has the cybersecurity resources and tools to safeguard their work. Mayorkas committed to working with CISA and the whole government to ensure federal agencies have the cybersecurity tools and resources they need to carry out their missions securely. 
Mayorkas committed to fully implementing Portman’s bipartisan Synthetics Trafficking & Overdose Prevention (STOP) Act which became law in 2018 and is working to help reduce the supply of fentanyl shipped into the United States through the U.S. Postal Service. On December 10, Portman pressed the federal agencies in charge of implementing the STOP Act on why they had not fully complied with the requirements as established in the law.    
Finally, Senator Portman and Mayorkas discussed his bipartisan Protecting Faith-Based and Nonprofit Organizations From Terrorism Act which provides grants to faith-based and other nonprofit organizations to help secure their facilities against a potential terrorist attack. Mayorkas committed to continuing to work with this program. 
A transcript of the exchange can be found here and a video can be found here. 
During Questioning from Senator Portman, Treasury Secretary Nominee Yellen Agrees on Need for Greater Long-Term Fiscal Discipline, Pledges to Be Voice of Fiscal Sanity 
Portman pressed Dr. Janet Yellen, nominee to serve as Secretary of the Treasury, about the long-term economic impact of the nation’s surging deficit and how we can begin to get back on a path towards greater fiscal stewardship. This comes days after President-Elect Biden laid out a plan to spend another $1.9 trillion – after Congress just enacted a $900 billion coronavirus relief package.  Biden’s new plan would be funded entirely by deficit spending. Yellen committed to Portman that she would be a voice for fiscal sanity and stated, “I completely agree with you, Senator Portman, that the Treasury Secretary has to be a voice for fiscal sanity, and I pledge to do that. Our finances need to be on a sustainable, long-run course. And that’s very important for us to focus on. I pledge to do that.""  
In addition, Portman highlighted the wide-ranging economic benefits brought about by the 2017 Tax Cuts And Jobs Act. Portman discussed how the 2017 tax reform law leveled the playing field for American businesses, helping to create jobs, spur investment and incentivize companies to move their operations and jobs back to the United States. Portman cautioned Dr. Yellen against raising the corporate tax rate, citing the negative impact a rate increase would have on our global competitiveness and broader economic health here at home.  
Excerpts of the hearing can be found here and a video can be found here. 
Portman Secures Commitment from Nominee for Secretary of State to Effectively Use Global Engagement Center to Combat Disinformation 
Portman secured commitments from the nominee to be U.S. Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing that if confirmed, he would support the efforts of the Global Engagement Center (GEC) to effectively combat disinformation and propaganda from foreign actors, like Russia and China. Senator Portman has worked to combat disinformation and cyberattacks both in the United States and abroad through his bipartisan Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act, which he authored with Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) and was signed into law in December 2016. The law improves the ability of the United States to counter foreign propaganda and disinformation by establishing the GEC, housed at the State Department to coordinate and synchronize counter-propaganda efforts throughout the U.S. government in support of friends and allies overseas.  The law provided funding and authorities to the State Department that authorizes the GEC to help counter the foreign propaganda and disinformation being waged against our allies by state and non-state adversaries.  
In addition, Portman secured a commitment from Mr. Blinken to continue to support Ukraine’s efforts to defend themselves against continued Russian aggression. For the past four years, Portman has successfully championed language in the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that expands U.S. military aid to Ukraine, while strongly encouraging the Ukrainian government to continue their efforts in eliminating corruption and continuing with much needed security sector reforms. These provisions helped build the primary statutory framework for U.S. security assistance to Ukraine, the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. In addition, he has repeatedly written letters, delivered multiple floor speeches, and pressed senior administration officials on the importance of providing meaningful assistance to help Ukraine stand up to Russia’s military aggression, and has praised its decisions to provide lethal assistance to the country. 
Finally, Portman also urged Mr. Blinken to hold China accountable for their continued theft of American taxpayer funded research and intellectual property. Senator Portman, as Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), led a year-long investigation into China’s talent recruitment programs like the Thousand Talents Program, culminating in a bipartisan report in November 2019 that detailed how China has recruited U.S.-based scientists and researchers since the late 1990s and incentivized them to transfer U.S. taxpayer-funded research and IP to China for their own military and economic gain. Last year, Portman introduced the bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act to protect American research and IP from global competitors.

Portman Attends Inauguration, Congratulates President Biden and Vice President Harris 
Portman issued the following statement after attending the Inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris: 
""I extend my congratulations to President and Dr. Biden, as well as Vice President Harris and Mr. Emhoff, on today’s historic Inauguration. I had the honor of attending, and I look forward to working with the new administration on areas where we agree in order to make a difference in the lives of Ohioans and all Americans. When we disagree, I will do so respectfully. Public service is a noble calling and anyone who serves deserves the respect of the American people, regardless of political affiliation."" 
Portman Statement on Biden Administration Action to Block Development of KeystoneXL Pipeline, Cost American Energy Jobs 
Portman issued the following statement in response to the Biden administration’s action to rescind the Presidential Permit needed for the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline:  
""As I’ve said previously, I want to work with the Biden administration to address the most pressing challenges facing our country. As the U.S. continues to struggle amid the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, it’s unfortunate that one of the Biden administration’s first actions will cost American jobs and hurt our economy. The pipeline is creating thousands of good-paying union jobs, boosting our manufacturing sector, and strengthening our energy security in cooperation with Canada, one of our closest allies. 
""I have long said that the Keystone XL Pipeline is an essential component of an ‘all-of-the-above’ energy policy that uses all sources of American energy – from nuclear to fossil to renewables to energy efficiency measures – that will enhance U.S. energy security needed to compete and succeed in the decades ahead. My stance has not changed, and I urge the Biden administration to re-examine its decision so that the Keystone XL Pipeline can create jobs, lower energy prices, and help grow our economy."" 
Portman Thanks Ohio National Guard Troops Deployed To Washington D.C. 
Portman issued the following statement after visiting today with members of the Ohio National Guard who have deployed to Washington D.C. to assist with security for President Biden’s Inauguration:  
""I was honored to have a chance to thank a number of the Ohio National Guardsmen and women who have deployed to Washington, D.C. to help protect the U.S. Capitol and assist with security for the Presidential Inauguration. Time after time, our Guardsmen answer the call to serve and they have carried out their mission here with dignity and the utmost professionalism. These men and women represent the very best our state and nation have to offer and I thank them for their service.""

On Senate Floor, Portman Commends Law Enforcement Officials and National Guardsmen Who Defended U.S. Capitol and Presidential Inauguration Ceremony 
On the Senate floor, Portman expressed his gratitude for the men and women of the United States Capitol Police, the U.S. Secret Service, and the U.S. National Guard who defended the Capitol during the inauguration of President Biden and Vice President Harris in the wake of the violent mob that stormed the building on January 6. He described visiting with some of the nearly 1000 Ohio National Guardsmen and women who were deployed to Washington ahead of the inauguration, and also highlighted the outstanding work the Ohio Army National Guard has done in helping the state respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Portman also mourned the loss of USCP officers Brian Sicknick, who was killed in the attack, and Howard Liebengood, who died shortly after. He committed to leading the bipartisan investigation into the security failings on January 6 in a fair, thorough, and expeditious manner along with the committees of jurisdiction – the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, the Rules Committee, Appropriations Committee, and the Intelligence Committee so that such a tragedy does not happen again. But Portman also commended the heroism displayed that day by individuals like Officer Eugene Goodman, who led rioters away from the Senate chamber, and Inspector Thomas Lloyd, who stood alongside his officers to push back against the mob. 
Finally, Portman also honored the life of Toledo Police Officer Brandon Stalker who tragically gave his life in the line of duty on Monday.

Ahead of Virtual March for Life, Portman Introduces Child Custody Protection Act 
Ahead of the virtual March for Life event next week, Portman introduced the Child Custody Protection Act, legislation which would make it a federal offense to transport a minor across a state line for an abortion if it would circumvent a state law requiring parental involvement in that minor’s abortion.  
""While I’m disappointed that we can’t get together and March for Life this year like we usually do, I’m pleased to introduce this important legislation in an effort to give a voice to the voiceless,” said Senator Portman. “Parents have a right to be involved in the most important decisions that their children make.  A large majority of Americans believe that minors should not make such an important decision without the guidance of a caring parent. This bill will strengthen state parental notification laws and ensure that parents and their daughters fully understand the consequences of this decision.  I’m proud of my consistent pro-life record and I’m fully committed to protecting the sanctity of life.""  
Portman, Shaheen, Capito, Whitehouse Introduce Bipartisan Drug-Free Communities Pandemic Relief Act to Combat Ongoing Drug Crisis 
Senators Portman, Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) introduced the bipartisan Drug-Free Communities Pandemic Relief Act in order to provide flexibility to Drug-Free Communities (DFC) coalitions during the COVID-19 pandemic by temporarily allowing the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) the authority to waive the program’s local matching requirements if the grantee is unable to meet them due to the ongoing pandemic.  
In 1997, Portman authored the Drug-Free Communities Act, which supports evidence-based, community-oriented drug prevention programs. The Drug-Free Communities Act is designed to improve effectiveness and accountability in these programs by capping the amount spent on administrative and overhead expenses, requiring all coalitions that receive grants to have experience in drug abuse prevention, and to match federal funding with local funds.  No other drug prevention program has achieved the same reduction in youth drug use that has been achieved consistently by the DFC program.
""The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a heartbreaking surge in overdose deaths, which is why it is essential that we give these coalitions the flexibility they need in order to keep their programs running. The Drug-Free Communities program is a proven, evidence-based, and community-oriented program that reduces substance abuse among our nation’s youth. I authored this legislation more than 20 years ago during my time in the House of Representatives, and it remains today the most effective program for consistently reducing youth drug use. I founded the Coalition for a Drug-Free Greater Cincinnati, now PreventionFIRST!, as a comprehensive effort to address youth substance abuse, and it’s something I care deeply about,"" said Senator Portman. “I have seen firsthand that prevention is a powerful tool to counteract drug use in our community, and this funding helps youth throughout Ohio make better, more healthy choices. These grants will help those on the frontlines in Ohio combat this crisis as we work together to turn the tide of addiction. It is imperative, now more than ever, that we work together to combat the crisis of addiction gripping our country, and I will continue to lead efforts in the Senate to turn the tide of this drug epidemic.""

Biden’s Man at Homeland Security 
With the recent attack on the Capitol, Latin American migrants headed to the U.S. border, and other looming threats, the Biden Administration is pushing for quick Senate approval of national-security nominees. On Tuesday Sen. Josh Hawley (R, Mo.) inflicted a small setback by objecting to fast-tracking Mr. Biden’s pick to head the Department of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, to a confirmation vote.
The Senator says he has concerns about the Biden Administration’s immigration plans, and that Mr. Mayorkas “declined to say he would enforce the laws Congress has already passed to secure the border wall system.” Mr. Mayorkas is also well known as an architect of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program that Barack Obama pushed through by executive fiat after he couldn’t get it through Congress.
Those pushing for quick approval argue Mr. Mayorkas has been confirmed by the Senate three times over his political career. But as Ohio Republican Rob Portman noted at Tuesday’s confirmation Senate hearing, Mr. Mayorkas was last confirmed in 2013. That was before the release of a scathing Inspector General report in which individuals “throughout the ranks of USCIS” complained that, as director of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Mr. Mayorkas had intervened to benefit wealthy and politically connected foreign investors seeking EB-5 visas.
These investors were connected to people such as former Clinton associate and future Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, and Tony Rodham, Hillary Clinton’s brother. The report further quotes one “high-ranking USCIS official” saying that employees with different views were afraid to speak up in meetings because Mr. Mayorkas would “cut them up, take them apart or put them in their place.""
The IG found nothing criminal, and Mr. Mayorkas insists he intervened only to ensure cases were decided correctly. But the report details Mr. Mayorkas’s troubling habit of communicating with applicants and stakeholders outside the normal process—and the “appearance of favoritism and special access” he created. The IG report adds that in each of the three instances investigated, “but for Mr. Mayorkas’ intervention, the matter would have been decided differently.” The IG at the time, Obama appointee John Roth, stands by his findings today.
This doesn’t sound like grounds for promotion to lead Homeland Security. Given the criminal investigation into his own son, President Biden should have a special interest in signaling there will be zero tolerance for cashing in on political connections in his Administration. The new Democratic Senate majority will nonetheless probably confirm Mr. Mayorkas, though on Tuesday the Senate delivered the message that people will be watching him closely.

MLK remembered across Dayton and the nation 
Marching, singing and chanting in gently falling snow, hundreds of residents took to a blocked-off section of West Third Street on Monday afternoon to remember the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and his message of justice.
The traditional march on the Third Street bridge, which is being renovated, has not happened in a couple of years. Participants Monday instead walked east from the Drew Health Center on Third Street, turning right before Edwin C. Moses Blvd. and gathering at a nearby park.
Joe Abrams, a Dayton resident, called the day the “best American holiday."" 
""It’s an important tradition, and I think it’s important to keep it up,” Abrams said. “It’s important for the community to come together, and to remember (King’s) spirit of equality, unity and people.""
Kema Brown, a Dayton resident, said this event was her second MLK Day march in Dayton. She marched last year with her daughter, who died in July after a battle with cancer. 
""Now I’m picking up the slack for her,” Brown said. “It’s my turn. It felt so good last year, and it feels good this year. 
""I wanted to continue on with the legacy,” she added. “I love Martin Luther King."" 
The march historically has crossed the Third Street bridge over the Great Miami River, also called the “Peace Bridge” as recognition of its role on that day. But a $16 million replacement/renovation project altered the route in January 2020 and on Monday. The bridge is scheduled to reopen in October this year.
King was remembered across the nation, with marches and rallies in many major cities. 
""Following recent division and the violent assault on our Capitol, Dr. King’s message of hope and peace is one we must reflect on and work to uphold,” U.S. Rep. Mike Turner, R-Dayton, tweeted Monday.
U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown was scheduled to deliver keynote remarks at the Dayton Unit NAACP’s Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration Monday evening. 
""Dr. King moved mountains with his words,” Brown said on Twitter on Monday.
In a video posted on Twitter, U.S. Sen. Rob Portman said King’s legacy “lives on in the hearts and souls of every person around the world committed to working toward a more just future."" 
Portman observed that MLK Day is also the only federal holiday that is designated a “national day of service,” set aside to “encourage people to volunteer their time to help their community."" 
Said Portman: “As Dr. King knew, many of the problems we face will be solved in our communities, in our families and ultimately in our hearts.""
A Martin Luther King Jr. event hosted by Sinclair Community College brought together more than 260 participants virtually. 
""I hope this is the first and last time we have to do this by Zooming,” said Steven Johnson, Sinclair president.
Introducing some 30 minutes of poetry and music, Furaha Henry-Jones, Sinclair’s poet laureate and an English professor, told participants that King “was asking tough questions."" 
""He asked these difficult questions and more. He provided answers that, as a nation, we haven’t wanted to hear,” she said. 
In the wake of the violence in the nation’s capital on Jan. 6, Henry-Jones said she has heard the phrase “This is not America” many times.

WORKING TOGETHER TOWARD OUR COMMON GOALS
￼
Fellow Hoosier,
This week we marked a vital moment in our democratic process: the inauguration of a new president and the peaceful transfer of power from one administration to the next.
As President Trump and Vice President Pence left office, I felt grateful for their tireless efforts over the last four years to put the American people first and make our country stronger, safer, and more prosperous.
On Wednesday – Inauguration Day – I offered my congratulations to President Biden and Vice President Harris and wished their families well.
Our country faces unprecedented challenges, and the president has an opportunity to unite the American people by following the path of bipartisan cooperation and rejecting a radical agenda.
No matter which party is in power, I will always fight for Hoosier workers, families, veterans, small businesses, and farmers. I stand ready to work with President Biden and his administration toward common goals, and I will stand firmly against policies that would threaten our economic recovery, weaken our national security, or erode Americans’ constitutional rights.
DEPLOYING SAFE & EFFECTIVE VACCINES
￼
Safe and effective vaccines will be the key to defeating coronavirus and rebuilding our economy. Two of these vaccines – developed through American ingenuity and innovation and approved by the FDA – are now being deployed across the country.
Thanks to the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed, we are already on track for 100 million vaccine doses in the next 100 days. 
Let’s aim higher. President Biden should work with Congressional Republicans to build on this success with a plan for 200 million doses in 100 days. 
You can learn more about the two approved vaccines here.
Indiana is leading the way in vaccine distribution, with more than 300,000 Hoosiers vaccinated. All Hoosiers aged 70 years or older are now eligible to make an appointment to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Vaccines administered by the state are free to all Indiana residents, but insurance may be charged an administrative fee.
Appointments can be made online at OurShot.in.gov or by calling 2-1-1. The second dose will be scheduled at the clinic when the first dose is administered. A caregiver or loved one also may make an appointment on behalf of an eligible senior.
In the meantime, we must all continue to follow these steps to prevent the spread of COVID-19:
	•	Wear a mask to protect yourself and others
	•	Stay at least 6 feet apart
	•	Practice good hand hygiene by washing with soap and water or using hand sanitizer
	•	Isolate yourself if you’re sick and stay home if you’ve been exposed to someone with COVID-19
	•	Clean frequently touched surfaces often
ICYMI: PPP IS FULLY REOPENED
￼
The successful Paycheck Protection Program is now fully reopened to help Main Street keep the lights on and save jobs.
Hoosier small businesses impacted by COVID-19 can apply for their first or second forgivable loan using the portal at sba.gov/ppp. You can learn more about PPP here.
Since its creation last year, PPP has supported more than 51 million American jobs and accounts for more than 80 percent of small business payroll in the United States. When Congress created PPP, we ensured Americans’ jobs and paychecks would be protected by requiring at least 60 percent of PPP funds to cover payroll costs. I will keep working with local, state, and federal leaders to recover and rebuild our economy.
As always, it is a privilege to represent 2nd District Hoosiers in Congress.

Sincerely,
￼

My Thoughts on President Biden's Inauguration

Joe Biden is now our Nation’s president and Kamala Harris is our vice president. I wish them success, for when they succeed, our Nation succeeds. My family and I will be praying for them. It was an honor to be able to witness the peaceful transition of power for the second time of my tenure in Congress.
 
I stand ready to work with President Biden and Vice President Harris to find bipartisan agreement on solutions to the critical issues facing American families. At the same time, I won’t hesitate to oppose President Biden, his Administration, and the Democratic-controlled Congress and hold them accountable for their party’s liberal impulses. 

Our Nation faces many problems. Now is the time for all of us to come together and govern in a bipartisan way. That is how we will begin to heal our divisions and move our country forward.

More Important Updates

Ensuring Public Employees Receive Social Security Benefits They've Earned
￼

Earlier this month, I re-introduced the bipartisan Social Security Fairness Act (SSFA), which eliminates the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), two titles of the Social Security Act that unfairly reduce or eliminate Social Security benefits for millions of Americans who have devoted much of their careers to public service. The legislation currently has 21 bipartisan co-sponsors. In the last session of Congress, we organized a bipartisan group of 264 co-sponsors of the legislation. 

This bipartisan bill ensures that a teacher who spends his or her summers working a second job or a police officer who changes careers after years of service will not face a possible 40 percent reduction in their Social Security benefits. By repealing these outdated provisions that unfairly penalize public servants in Illinois, we can provide some certainty to retirees while helping to recruit future teachers, firefighters, and police officers.

You can find more information about the Social Security Fairness Act here. 
￼


Supporting Local Restaurants and Providing Meals to People in Need

This month, I re-introduced the bipartisan FEMA Empowering Essential Deliveries (FEED) Act. This bill allows the Federal government to pay 100 percent of the cost to states and localities so that they can partner with restaurants and nonprofits to prepare nutritious meals for vulnerable populations, such as seniors and underprivileged children. These partnerships will support businesses and small farmers as the Coronavirus pandemic continues.

If this pandemic has shown us anything, it’s that we need to be innovative in how we respond to this crisis, and that’s exactly what the FEED Act does. This bill helps support our restaurant industry, which has been hit hard during this pandemic, in a way that’s never been done before. By creating these partnerships between local governments and local restaurants, we can help get meals to people in need more quickly and help the food industry, which is a major employer and a critical part of our economy, during this difficult time.

You can find out more information about the FEED Act here.

President Biden's Keystone XL Pipeline Executive Order Will Hurt Our Local Economy
￼

Pipelines are a safe and efficient way to transport energy, and they create good-paying jobs for communities we represent at refineries like those in Wood River. President Biden’s executive order to halt construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and other environmental policies he’s pursuing will threaten energy and union jobs in Illinois and across the country. 

﻿It’s unfortunate that on Day One of his presidency, President Biden opted to fulfill a campaign promise to left-wing environmental activists instead of supporting the American labor community and energy workers in a struggling economy. We urge the President and his Administration to pursue an all-of-the-above energy approach that protects energy and union jobs and secures low-cost energy for our constituents.

1/23/21 10:02,President Biden Must Immediately Reverse Actions Against American Energy,"￼
Website  |   About  |   Contact Me  |   Serving You  |   Media Center  |   Our District 

January 23, 2021
 
THE SCALISE CAPITOL REPORT
 
Over the past four years, America has become energy dominant. This has resulted in a more secure country, lower energy prices for hard-working families, and thousands of good-paying American jobs – especially here in Southeast Louisiana, where so much of the production and development of energy takes place. Our robust energy infrastructure is not only vital to Louisiana’s economy, but also to our national economy. Energy exploration and production in the Gulf of Mexico also provides the dual benefit of bringing critical dollars to our state for coastal restoration and flood protection efforts.
 
I was disappointed this week when President Biden moved to undo many of our gains to make America energy dominant. On his first day in office, he rescinded the Keystone XL pipeline permit and rejoined the Paris Agreement, followed by a 60-day ban on issuing oil and gas leases and permits on federal lands and waters.
 
Rescinding the Keystone XL Pipeline and Rejoining the Paris Agreement
 
President Biden’s decision to rescind an essential permit for the Keystone XL pipeline puts thousands of present and future jobs at risk and undermines the trust of our friends and allies in Canada who want to see this project completed. American energy security will also be undermined because this Canadian energy, destined for refineries along the Gulf Coast, will now be replaced by imports from unreliable OPEC countries.  
 
Additionally, re-joining the Paris Agreement will be detrimental to American families and workers. Estimates show that the reduction in manufacturing necessary to comply with the unrealistic Paris Accord mandates would destroy up to 2.7 million jobs in the U.S. by 2025. Those jobs would go to exempt countries like China and India, who emit significantly more carbon than us now, and are allowed to increase their emissions through 2030 under the flawed terms of the agreement.
 
The harmful policies that make up this agreement will hit low-income Americans the hardest by increasing energy costs and destroying good-paying jobs at a time when millions have lost their jobs and families who are struggling need affordable energy the most.
 
Consequences of the Biden Administration’s 60-day Ban on Oil and Gas Leases
 
President Biden’s day-one action to halt energy leasing and permits signals an alarming return to the same failed energy policies of the past that inflicted real harm on hard-working families and undermined America’s energy security. Let’s not forget that it was similar policies during the Obama Administration that resulted in gas prices higher than $4 per gallon, utility bills that skyrocketed, and thousands of jobs lost. 
 
This action by President Biden, on just his first full day in office, threatens the economic livelihoods of millions of American families, and should be immediately reversed. The last thing we need in the middle of a global pandemic is more unemployed Americans and higher energy costs for families who are already struggling. 
 
Energy made in America creates jobs, lowers the cost of gas and electricity for all American families and small businesses, and advances American interests on the world stage. Additionally, these leases bring critical dollars for coastal restoration and flood protection to our state. 
 
I urge the Biden Administration to get serious about supporting American energy independence and stand ready to work with President Biden to protect our nation’s energy abundance – both on and off America’s shores.
 
It is an honor to represent you in Congress. For more information please visit my website, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook pages.
 
God Bless

1/23/21 9:30,The Ever-Expanding Power of the Executive Branch,"
￼

Congressman Smith's E-news: January 23, 2021  
￼

It was a privilege meeting with the brave members of the Nebraska National Guard stationed at the Cannon office building in Washington this week. Thank you for your service!

The Ever-Expanding Power of the Executive Branch

On January 20, we witnessed the transition of power from one President to the next – a hallmark of our democracy. I congratulate President Biden and Vice President Harris as we move forward as a country to tackle the challenges we have in front of us. I look forward to working with the Biden administration on important issues such as rural health care, increasing trade opportunities, and fixing our nation’s infrastructure. 

However, I have serious concern that the new administration is already following the Obama-Biden example of flooding our government with burdensome and overreaching regulations in an attempt to bypass the legislative process and govern solely through executive action. While I appreciate that President Trump worked hard throughout his term to overturn the most egregious of President Obama’s regulations, the substitution of Executive Orders (EOs) for legislation undermines the legislative branch and upsets the balance of power in our government. EOs and regulations should be used to implement laws passed by Congress, not to create new laws. I fought for eight years to stop the most egregious overreaches of the Obama administration, and I am prepared to do so again.

Included in the barrage of first day EOs from President Biden was cancelation of the Keystone XL pipeline. The Obama administration held up the approval process for the Keystone XL for seven years before refusing to grant the permit despite the project passing extended reviews of the law and the science by the Obama administration. President Trump corrected this abuse by the Obama administration, granting Keystone XL the federal permit they had earned. More than $1 billion has already been invested in the project, which was projected to support 11,000 jobs in 2021.

Now, this action by President Biden to revoke the permit not only strains our relationship with Canada but endangers other job-creating foreign investment in the United States. The U.S. has always been an attractive place for opening businesses and creating jobs because of our strong belief in the rule of law and the consistency it provides – the arbitrary cancellation of this permit could raise serious questions for anyone thinking of bringing new energy projects or other jobs to the United States.

The self-inflicted harm created by unilaterally cancelling the Keystone XL project highlights the hazards of the President ruling by decree. The growing power of the executive branch should concern all of us – no matter which party is in power. In 2015, despite the constitutional requirement of Senate approval for foreign treaties, President Obama entered the United States into the Paris Agreement. This agreement required the United States to reduce our carbon emissions disproportionately compared to every other country, even though our carbon emissions have “the largest absolute decline among all countries since 2000,” according to the International Energy Agency. During his presidency, President Trump rightly withdrew the United States from this unfair and unconstitutional agreement. However, with President Biden’s recent EO, we will now return to the agreement within 30 days – once again without constitutionally-mandated Senate approval. This decision, which could potentially affect all areas of our economy, should not be in the hands of one person. 

Although I am ready and willing to work with President Biden on issues that benefit our country, I will not stand by in the face of damaging policies. The first step is to call out these actions and then use the tools available to us to fight against them. This requires all Americans to stay involved and active in our government, especially by letting government officials know where they stand. I will continue to fight against burdensome regulations, the overuse of EOs, and the ever-growing power of executive branch.

Inauguration Day
This week, just as we have done since 1789, our country honored the peaceful transfer of power that is fundamental to our republic. I extend my best wishes to the newly inaugurated President and Vice President and look forward to ways in which we can work together for the nation. President Biden’s leadership of our country comes at a time of significant division and differing views of where we should go as a nation. Unfortunately, some of his first Executive Orders threaten the accomplishments of the last four years. We should be focused on working to unify the country by defeating the virus, rebuilding a strong economy, and getting Americans back to work. By putting America first, we will be able to move past this period of uncertainty and toward a brighter and more optimistic future.

1/23/21 8:50,An inauguration like no other,"￼ 

January 23, 2021 
Dear Fellow Marylander: 
This week, America started to write a new chapter of history with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Two weeks after an armed insurrectionist crowd invaded the United States Capitol with the intent of overturning the election results, our nation witnessed the peaceful transfer of power as defined by our Constitution. 
As President Biden said in his inaugural address on Wednesday: “Through a crucible for the ages America has been tested anew and America has risen to the challenge. Today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy."" 
I was overjoyed to attend the swearing-in ceremony and be there to affirm the resiliency of our democracy. It was an inaugural like no other before it. The emotions across the sparse crowd were palatable. For the most part, we stood together as Americans – not Democrats or Republicans or independents. We all understood the urgency of the moment. It was a turning point in history and essential for the forward progress and endurance of our nation. 
As President Biden said: “We look ahead in our uniquely American way – restless, bold, optimistic – and set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be."" 
In more “normal” times, many Marylanders would have attended the celebration or events surrounding the inauguration. Like you, I would have given anything to have tens of thousands of everyday people on the National Mall rather than thousands of National Guard troops on patrol. While I was a huge fan of the virtual inauguration parade and concert, which brought this experience into living rooms from coast to coast, I do look forward to a future time when we can gather safely as a nation to mark these magical moments together. 
As the president said: “Few periods in our nation’s history have been more challenging or difficult than the one we’re in now … To overcome these challenges – to restore the soul and to secure the future of America – requires more than words. It requires that most elusive of things in a democracy: Unity."" 
I am an optimist but also a realist. The inauguration of Joe Biden as president of the United States is an opportunity to start anew. It’s a chance to restore alliances and renew the American spirit. We will not simply forget the last four years, but we can agree to learn from it and right the wrongs that put Americans at risk and cost people their livelihoods and their lives. 
Together, we can celebrate the first woman, first Black and first South Asian vice president in our nation’s history. The loud thunder you heard on Wednesday was not only applause for the new administration, but the shattering of another glass ceiling by a remarkably qualified and strong American who will lead this country with experiences no one who has come before her has ever brought to the office. Congratulations, Madam Vice President! 
Despite the uplifting spirit of the inauguration of our 46th president, the realist in me understands how close we came to losing so much of what it means to be America. Our country has never been perfect but it has been a beacon around the world because of what we aspire to be. Freedom and opportunity, truth and the rule of law have been bedrock, but not always accessible to all. That two such Americas exist is not a new concept but we now have a president who aims to bridge that gap and heal the divide rather than merely pit one person against another in fear or hate. 
As President Biden said: “I know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know they are not new. Our history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, and demonization have long torn us apart. The battle is perennial. Victory is never assured. Through the Civil War, the Great Depression, World War, 9/11, through struggle, sacrifice, and setbacks, our ‘better angels’ have always prevailed. In each of these moments, enough of us came together to carry all of us forward. And, we can do so now.""
If you did not have the opportunity to watch the presidential inaugural ceremony or any of the events of this week, I urge you to do so. Watch with an open heart and open mind of what America could be when we all work and play together. The problems of our nation are not sugar-coated or brushed aside, but viewed through a prism of what could be when we try to connect with one another. 
Lastly, if you only watch one thing from the full week of events, please watch the incredible recitation of America’s Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman. You can read her poignant words below, but I promise you that the presentation of this young woman, who stands on the shoulders of American greats like Robert Frost and Maya Angelou, will touch your soul. 
Thank you and stay well.

""The Hill We Climb” – by Amanda Gorman. Written for and recited at the inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris
When day comes we ask ourselves, where can we find light in this never-ending shade? The loss we carry, a sea we must wade. We’ve braved the belly of the beast. We’ve learned that quiet isn’t always peace. In the norms and notions of what just is isn’t always justice. 
And yet, the dawn is ours before we knew it. Somehow, we do it. Somehow, we’ve weathered and witnessed a nation that isn’t broken, but simply unfinished. We, the successors of a country and a time where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president, only to find herself reciting for one. 
And yes, we are far from polished, far from pristine, but that doesn’t mean we are striving to form a union that is perfect. We are striving to forge our union with purpose, to compose a country committed to all cultures, colors, characters and conditions of man. 
And so, we lift our gazes not to what stands between us, but what stands before us. We close the divide because we know, to put our future first, we must first put our differences aside. We lay down our arms so we can reach out our arms to one another. We seek harm to none and harmony for all. Let the globe, if nothing else, say this is true. That even as we grieved, we grew. That even as we hurt, we hoped; that even as we tired, we tried; that we’ll forever be tied together, victorious. Not because we will never again know defeat, but because we will never again sow division. 
Scripture tells us to envision that everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid. If we’re to live up to our own time, then victory won’t lie in the blade, but in all the bridges we’ve made. That is the promise to glade, the hill we climb if only we dare it. Because being American is more than a pride we inherit; it’s the past we step into and how we repair it. We’ve seen a forest that would shatter our nation rather than share it, would destroy our country if it meant delaying democracy. And this effort very nearly succeeded. 
But while democracy can be periodically delayed, it can never be permanently defeated. In this truth, in this faith we trust, for while we have our eyes on the future, history has its eyes on us. This is the era of just redemption. We feared it at its inception. We did not feel prepared to be the heirs of such a terrifying hour, but within it, we found the power to author a new chapter, to offer hope and laughter to ourselves. 
So, while once we asked: “How could we possibly prevail over catastrophe?” Now we assert, “How could catastrophe possibly prevail over us?"" 
We will not march back to what was, but move to what shall be: a country that is bruised, but whole; benevolent, but bold; fierce and free. We will not be turned around or interrupted by intimidation, because we know our inaction and inertia will be the inheritance of the next generation. Our blunders become their burdens. But one thing is certain, if we merge mercy with might, and might with right, then love becomes our legacy, and change our children’s birthright. 
So, let us leave behind a country better than one we were left. With every breath from my bronze-pounded chest, we will raise this wounded world into a wondrous one. We will rise from the gold-limned hills of the West. We will rise from the wind-swept Northeast where our forefathers first realized revolution. We will rise from the lake-rimmed cities of the Midwestern states. We will rise from the sun-baked South. We will rebuild, reconcile and recover in every known nook of our nation, in every corner called our country our people diverse and beautiful will emerge battered and beautiful. 
When day comes, we step out of the shade aflame and unafraid. The new dawn blooms as we free it. For there is always light. If only we’re brave enough to see it. If only we’re brave enough to be it.

WEEK IN REVIEW 
Dear Friend –   On January 20, 2021, America once again sent a strong message to the world and transferred power to a new presidential administration, a sacred tradition of our democracy.    As an eternal optimist, I am hopeful we can work together with President Joe Biden, and the first female Vice President, Kamala Harris, in a bipartisan way to deliver for the American people. From the Renewable Fuel Standard to economic policy, and from agriculture to national defense, I will hold this administration accountable and always put Iowa’s interests first.    Here are some highlights from what else I’ve been working on this week:  

Always Ready, Always There. 
Always Ready, Always There—that’s the motto of the National Guard. From serving on the frontlines of the pandemic, to helping Iowans recover from the devastating derecho, and securing our nation’s capital, our dedicated Guardsmen continue to live up to this mission.

I was fortunate enough to speak with our Iowa troops and even administer the oath for twenty guardsmen re-enlisting in the Iowa Army National Guard and two re-enlisting in the Iowa Air National Guard.   As a former company and battalion commander in the Iowa Army National Guard, I could not be more proud of their tireless and selfless efforts. May God bless the men and women of the National Guard.  

Confirming the Next Secretary of Defense 
On Friday, I voted to confirm Lloyd Austin as the next Secretary of Defense. During this week’s Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC) hearing for Mr. Austin, I questioned him about military sexual assault and harassment, the roles and mission of the National Guard, and the need for the Pentagon to finally pass a financial audit.

As the top Republican on the SASC Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities, I will work with Secretary Austin and hold him accountable on these very issues.

During our battles with a global pandemic, severe storms, and security threats, the men and women of the National Guard have been steady and committed heroes for our state and nation. We owe them our sincerest thanks and appreciation.

National crisis calls for national unity, and in some ways for me that means business as usual. I’m focused on helping President Biden bring our country together, getting us through this pandemic and on the road to economic recovery. 
I’m ready to work with President Biden where we agree on issues that matter to Iowans, particularly lowering prescription drug costs. 
This week, the Senate Finance Committee unanimously advanced the nomination of Dr. Janet Yellen to be the Secretary of the Treasury. 
It should also be noted that, in considering Dr. Yellen’s nomination, we have not organized any resistance campaign, vote boycott or personalized attacks on her character. Unfortunately, I cannot say that like treatment was afforded to all nominees of the prior administration. 
Although Democrats will control the leadership reins of the first and second branches of the federal government for at least the next two years, they’d do well to lean in on a bit of Midwestern common sense that’s served me well on my family farm and in Congress: Don’t put the cart before the horse.

Inauguration Marked a New Dawn of Hope & Healing for our Nation
 
 
January 23, 2021  
Dear Friends,
After a bruising months-long campaign at the hands of some of America’s most powerful politicians, this week our democracy had its day. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were sworn in peacefully, just two weeks after the deadly attacks on our Capitol and our republic by supporters of the outgoing president. The will of the American people prevailed. 
Standing before the Capitol for the first time since those attacks, I was reminded of the scene that day. And during his inaugural address, Joe Biden confronted those memories with impressive generosity and resolve. He gave us a new vision for our nation, a more inclusive kind of politics, that carries the urgent promise of helping to reunite our divided nation, to help us heal and move forward to tackle the many crises we now face.
I had the pleasure to attend the Inauguration myself, and to see Joe Biden sworn in as our 46th President of the United States. And I was especially moved to witness as Kamala Harris took her oath and became the first female, Black and South Asian Vice-President in U.S. history.
What a beautiful expression of America’s progress and promise. 
After their swearing-in, President Biden and Vice President Harris offered messages that were solemn but hopeful, and both bold and urgent. And, true to form, just hours after being sworn in they were getting to work advancing several key Executive Orders. They include:
	•	Leading America’s COVID Rescue
	◦	Leading by example, mask-wearing will be required in all federal buildings, on federal land and for interstate travel including on planes and trains.
	◦	Putting science and public health before politics, America returns to our rightful place in the World Health Organization to help lead the global coronavirus response.
	•	Sparking our Nation’s Economic Recovery
	◦	Millions of Americans who are at risk will not face the danger of losing their homes thanks to an extension of the nationwide moratorium on evictions and foreclosures through at least March 31.
	◦	Federal student loan payment requirements will remain paused until at least September 30.
	•	Retaking the Lead on Bold Climate Action
	◦	America will once again honor our voluntary commitments under the Paris Agreement and restore our global leadership in tackling the climate crisis.
	◦	Protections for the environment and public health will be restored and government action will once again be guided by science
	•	Restoring America’s Soulful Immigration Heritage
	◦	The cruel and pointless Muslim ban restricting immigrants and refugees from seven Muslim-majority countries has ended.
These actions mark a new, brighter chapter for America but our task ahead remains great. Governing this divided nation will not be easy. Let us take heart in knowing that our strength is in our diversity and our unity. We are one nation, governed by the people and for the people. We are not a perfect union, but we are ever-striving to become one.
In the words of America’s first youth poet laureate Amanda Gorman during the Inauguration ceremony, 
“And so we lift our gazes not to what stands between us but what stands before us”
For there is always light,
if only we’re brave enough to see it
If only we’re brave enough to be it
 
As always, thank you for reading.   Your friend, ￼ 
  
DID YOU KNOW?
Throughout this pandemic, my office and I have worked to make sure you remain informed with the latest updates and recommendations on any and all COVID-19 related topics. With that in mind here is some information that may be of interest to you:
	•	With vaccinations in NYS and across the nation underway, many Americans have questions about vaccination distribution, eligibility, and how to schedule an appointment. 
	•	Vaccine Doses: Currently, NYS is receiving between 250,000-300,000 doses per week; this number is inclusive of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
	•	Eligibility: Vaccine distribution has been divided into phases, with early phases representing the highest priority populations for vaccination. New York is in Phase 1b, in which those 65+ as well as essential workers, including police, fire, education and transit workers, are now eligible.
	◦	To determine if you are eligible, visit: https://am-i-eligible.covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/ 
	•	Where to get the Vaccine: New York State has enrolled thousands of sites to serve as vaccination sites, including hospitals, doctors’ offices, pharmacies, and urgent care centers across the state.
	◦	The am I eligible site shows available appointments at New York State-run vaccination sites. If eligible, you must schedule an appointment. If you visit a location without an appointment you will not receive a vaccine.

THE BLACKBURN REPORT  January 22, 2021 
SENATE INSIDER  
WITNESSING THE PEACEFUL TRANSITION OF POWER 
On Wednesday, I joined my fellow U.S. Senators at the inauguration ceremony to honor our traditions and witness the peaceful transition of power that has been the hallmark of our democracy since 1789. I wish our new President and Vice President well and will continue my work to protect our constitutional freedoms and improve the lives of Tennesseans. 
￼ 
  
ADVOCATING FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE 
President Biden spent his first few hours in the White House signing a flood of executive orders and actions the administration claims will help American families. But I’m concerned these actions will do quite the opposite, and put Americans out of work at a time when families are already struggling to make ends meet. For instance, those executive orders focused on green climate policy will lead to a loss of energy independence, higher energy costs, and the destruction of good-paying American jobs. 
￼ 
 
UPHOLDING THE CONSTITUTION 
Thank you to our brave men and women serving in the Tennessee National Guard who helped defend the rule of law this week at the United States Capitol. Meeting a few of these National Guard members as they safeguarded the halls of democracy was an honor.

Aloha, Friend:
U.S. Representative Don Young is a Republican from Alaska who is the Dean of the House, having served since 1973, longer than any other Member. He is a colleague and a friend and, although there is much on which we disagree, we partner as and where we can on matters of mutual interest to Alaska and Hawai‘i, as he has done with generations of Hawai’i Members.
On January 3rd, as we all gathered in the U.S. House chamber to commence the 117th Congress (2021-2023) just three days before the violent assault on our Capitol and democracy, it was Representative Young’s duty as Dean to swear in the Speaker. Before he did, he took a few moments to convey thoughts to all of his colleagues:
“I have been in this House longer than anybody else. … I love this institution. I will be honest: I do not like what I see. It is time we hold hands and talk to one another.”
Wednesday, just two weeks after the attack, I was deeply humbled to attend the inauguration of President Biden and Vice President Harris on the Capitol steps. As I listened to President Biden’s inaugural address to our nation and world, Don’s words came back as a new President asked of each and all of us much of the same: We are one ‘ohana. Stop, listen, consider, talk. Agree where we can, disagree constructively where we can’t. Trust in our democracy and our foundations to muster the best in us to find the best way forward for all Americans, together.
Here is President Biden's Inaugural Speech along with my own comments. Whether or not you supported President Biden for President, I hope you will read or reread his thoughts, his appeal to national unity in the face of severe crises on several fronts. Not unity of thought on every issue; that is not what democracy is about. But unity of purpose, of commitment to our country, of common values, all carrying with them the obligation to start by holding hands and talking with one another.
This Inauguration, like the 58 that preceded it back centuries, was not just an event, but an opportunity to renew our vows to our country, to each other. It offers a new beginning to us all, and I pledge to do my part as I turn back to my three-part mission as your U.S. Congressman to (1) help lead our country, (2) help our Hawai‘i, and (3) help you and yours.
In that spirit:
Small Business and Social Security Talk Stories
I am continuing with my open community talk stories on critical issues facing us all. My next two will address COVID-19 emergency assistance to Hawaii’s small businesses and Social Security benefits for so many Hawai‘i residents. Here are the details:

Wednesday, January 27th, 9:00 - 10:30 AM HST
I will be joined by special guests Thornton (Mark) Spain, the new Small Business Administration District Director for the State of Hawaiʻi, Cathy Wiltse, the State Director of Hawai‘i Small Business Development Centers, and Dana Hauanio, the Director of the Minority Business Development Agency Business Center Honolulu. To sign up for my event, please visit this link.
Social Security Talk Story with Congressman Ed Case
Wednesday, February 3rd, 10:00 - 11:30 AM HST
I will be joined by Jane Burigsay, Public Affairs Specialist with the Social Security Administration (SSA).  We will be discussing how SSA is operating in the Covid-19 environment to deliver you your benefits and answer your questions.  You may submit questions ahead of time to edcase.events@mail.house.gov and we will try and get through as many as possible. To sign up for this workshop, please register here: https://ushr.zoomgov.com/j/1607369437pwd=TjdITGFaSDVRZVhQcGVWSlNjUTI2UT09
Jones Act and Other Legislation
As we commence this two-year Congress, I am introducing and pursuing legislation on issues of special concern to our Hawai’i. Here are three of the bills I’ve introduced to date:
Jones Act
Last week, I introduced three pieces of legislation to reform the century-old Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (commonly referred to as the “Jones Act”), which is widely credited with unnecessarily increasing our cost of living in Hawai‘i. My bills are:
	•	the Noncontiguous Shipping Relief Act, which exempts all noncontiguous U.S. locations, including  Hawai‘i, from the Jones Act;
	•	the Noncontiguous Shipping Reasonable Rate Act, which benchmarks the definition of a “reasonable rate” which domestic shippers can charge as no more than ten percent above international shipping rates for comparable routes; and
	•	the Noncontiguous Shipping Competition Act, which cancels the Jones Act and opens up competition wherever monopolies or duopolies in noncontiguous Jones Act shipping develop.
My statement for the official Congressional Record on introductions is here.
Safe and Quiet Skies Act
Yesterday, I re-introduced my Safe and Quiet Skies Act, which would impose strict safety and community disruption regulations on commercial air tour operations to include helicopters and small planes. My bill would address safety and national defense risks and community disruption, by prohibiting overflights of defense, park, cemetery and other sensitive installations and requiring minimum altitude and maximum noise limits on all flights. Additionally, it would allow states, localities and tribes to impose stricter regulations on tour flights in their jurisdictions, to include time, route and frequency, with required public engagement.
My statement for the official Congressional Record on introduction is here.
Hawai‘i Invasive Species Protection Act
Yesterday, I re-introduced my Hawai‘i Invasive Species Protection Act, which would require the same preclearance inspection of baggage for invasive pests currently required when leaving Hawai‘i to be required before entering the state (in other words, what is good for California should be good for Hawai‘i). Since I introduced this bill in the last Congress, even more invasive pests and diseases have snuck into Hawai‘i including coffee leaf rust, which is devastating our coffee industry. My bill would be a critical component in preventing these invasives that are threatening our unique national resources and local agricultural producers from coming to Hawai‘i. My statement for the official Congressional Record on introduction is here.
Please know that my D.C. and Honolulu staff and I remain fully committed to seeing our county, our Hawai’i and you and yours through this very difficult time for us all. As always, please contact me at ed.case@mail.house.gov with any questions and comments.
Best wishes and be well.

1/22/21 20:39,Securing Affordable Housing for Every Oregonian,"￼  
Dear Friend, 

Affordable housing has been a serious and persistent issue in communities in every corner of our state -- one that has only been made worse by the health and economic impacts of the coronavirus crisis. Especially now, when health experts are encouraging us to stay at home and avoid people from outside our households in order to curb the spread this pandemic, it couldn’t be more important that we double down on our efforts to address our affordable housing shortages.  

That’s why when it came time to pass our 2021 federal spending bills, I used my position on the Senate Appropriations Committee to ensure that the bills included resources that will help Oregonians put roofs over their heads. Those resources-- which are detailed in the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development spending bill that passed in December -- include: 

	•	$3.5 billion for the Community Development Block Grant, a program that funds vital housing rehabilitation, supportive services, public improvements, and economic development projects in communities across Oregon and the nation, while simultaneously encouraging local investment.
	•	$895 million for affordable housing assistance that will help 1.2 million low-income households.
	•	$10 million for the Self-Help Homeownership Opportunity Program (SHOP), which provides funds for non-profit sweat-equity homebuilders, such as Habitat for Humanity, to help cover costs associated with new land purchases and infrastructure building.
	•	$5 million for the Rural Capacity Building Program, which helps build the capacity of rural low income housing non-profits by providing training, information, technical assistance, and financing.
	•	$3 billion for Homeless Assistance Grants, a $179 million increase over previous years, which will help organizations across Oregon. That funding includes $82 million for homeless youth programs, and $290 million to support street outreach, emergency shelter, homelessness prevention, and rapid re-housing assistance to those in need.
	•	$1.35 billion for the HOME Investment Partnerships Program, which provides states and localities with flexible resources to respond to their affordable housing challenges, including rental housing and paths to homeownership for low-income families.
	•	$40 million for Housing and Urban Development-Veterans Affairs supportive housing, to provide new rental assistance vouchers for homeless veterans, along with case management and clinical services. These vouchers have been critical to reducing veterans’ homelessness by 49 percent since 2010.

In addition, I worked to include in the spending bill that funds the U.S. Department of Agriculture $1.41 billion for rural rental assistance funding and $40 million for Rural Housing Service Vouchers. Those resources will be critical in our fight to address the housing crisis in Oregon’s rural communities -- many of which have been especially hard-hit by the pandemic. 

Every Oregonian, regardless of the color of their skin, zip code, or income, deserves a safe roof over their head -- especially during global public health emergency. I’m going to keep doing everything I can to fight for the resources we need to tackle Oregon’s affordable housing crisis head on and turn that vision into a reality. 

All my best, 
Jeff

Sen. Rick Applauds State Department’s Decision to Classify Communist China’s Atrocities Against Uyghurs as Genocide 
Senator Rick Scott applauded the U.S. State Department’s decision to classify as genocide the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) oppression and atrocities against the Uyghurs, a religious and ethnic minority living in the northwestern province of Xinjiang. This decision comes after Senator Scott called on Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to take this action last month.    Senator Rick Scott said, “We know what’s happening in Communist China is a genocide. The CCP has established hundreds of concentration camps in order to imprison, torture and enslave Uyghurs living in Xinjiang. Through torture, the CCP threatens Uyghurs to forsake their language, their faith and their culture. I’ve been calling for strong action for months, and I’m glad the Administration listened and took a stand today against murderous dictators and let the world know this won’t be tolerated. The United States is the greatest supporter of freedom and democracy in the world, and we will never stop fighting to end human rights abuses. I urge every freedom-loving nation to do the same."" Read more HERE.

President Biden is throwing the U.S. back into the Paris Agreement just to appease his liberal friends. This deal does nothing to hold real polluters, like Communist China and India, accountable and it unfairly puts American taxpayers on the hook. It was bad for America when Obama signed it and it’s still bad now.” Read more HERE.

This announcement follows Senator Scott and Senator Rubio’s letter to R.D. James, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, outlining their priorities for the work plan.    Senator Rick Scott said, “I’m glad to see the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prioritize many Florida projects in their upcoming work plan, including funding for Everglades restoration projects. These important projects will build on our efforts to protect our environment and ensure future generations can enjoy all our state has to offer.""  Read more from Senator Rubio’s office HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott: Biden’s Amnesty Plan is Irresponsible and Does Nothing To Secure the Border 
Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after President Biden released portions of his proposed immigration plan.  Senator Rick Scott said, “No more than a day after being sworn in, President Biden and Chuck Schumer’s Senate Democrats are already pushing a radical immigration agenda of amnesty and open borders. They have paused deportations of illegal immigrants and implemented policies that will create a humanitarian crisis at the border once again, threatening American safety and depleting Border Patrol resources. He plans to change our immigration system without any mention of border security. Providing full amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants with no efforts whatsoever to secure the border and ensure this doesn’t happen again makes no sense. Surely substantial changes to our immigration system are needed, but blanket amnesty is not the answer. I’ve long called for reforms to fix the broken immigration system and believe we must take swift action to address this critical issue, including providing real, long-term solutions for TPS and DACA. If Congress ever wants to find genuine consensus and permanent solutions, we have to start with securing the border and implementing safeguards against bad actors and those seeking to break our laws."" Read more HERE.

Senador Rick Scott: El plan de inmigración de Biden no hace nada para proteger la frontera 
El Senador Rick Scott hizo la siguiente declaración luego de que el presidente Biden publicara parte de su propuesta de reforma migratoria.  El Senador Rick Scott dijo: “Menos de un día desde su inauguración, el presidente Biden y los demócratas del Senado de Chuck Schumer ya están impulsando una agenda migratoria radical de amnistía y fronteras abiertas. Han detenido las deportaciones de inmigrantes ilegales e implementado políticas que crearán una crisis humanitaria en la frontera una vez más, amenazando la seguridad de los americanos y agotando los recursos de la patrulla fronteriza. El presidente Biden tiene como plan reformar nuestro sistema de inmigración sin mencionar la seguridad en nuestra frontera. No tiene sentido otorgar amnistía total a millones de inmigrantes sin ningún esfuerzo para asegurar la frontera y garantizar que esto no vuelva a suceder. Es evidente que se necesitan cambios en nuestro sistema de inmigración, pero amnistía total no es la respuesta. Durante mucho tiempo he pedido reformas para arreglar nuestro sistema de inmigración que no funciona y creo que debemos tomar medidas rápidas, incluyendo provisiones permanentes para solucionar TPS y DACA. Pero si el Congreso quiere encontrar un consenso genuino y soluciones permanentes, tenemos que comenzar por asegurar la frontera e implementar salvaguardas contra los malos actores y aquellos que buscan violar nuestras leyes”. Lea más AQUÍ.

Sen. Rick Scott Votes to Confirm General Lloyd Austin for Secretary of Defense 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following his vote to confirm retried General Lloyd Austin as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Defense.   Senator Rick Scott said, “I voted to confirm General Lloyd Austin as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Defense. I worked with General Austin at MacDill Air Force Base when I was Governor of Florida, and I respect his decades of military service to our nation. Although I did not vote in favor of a waiver because Congress has clear laws in place to safeguard civilian control over the military, I do believe General Austin is qualified and ready to lead the Department of Defense. I look forward to working with General Austin to make sure America remains the strongest military force in the world and that our troops have every resource they need to protect our nation and its allies."" Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott to Biden Administration: Stop Sending Taxpayer Dollars to Communist China 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement calling on the Biden Administration to address the millions in taxpayer money the United States government provides annually to China and Chinese-affiliated enterprises. In 2019, Senator Scott requested detailed information on exactly how much funding the United States government provides annually to China and Chinese-affiliated enterprises, and this information was just made publicly available by the Trump Administration. Senator Scott also successfully fought for the Peace Corps to leave Communist China, a developed nation and an adversary to the U.S., to protect taxpayer dollars and Peace Corps resources.    Senator Rick Scott said, “While great progress was made under the Trump Administration to hold Communist China accountable and stop sending American taxpayer dollars to an adversarial nation, more must be done. The Chinese Communist Party steals our technology, abuses human rights, builds up their military to compete with us, and is committing a genocide against the Uyghurs. But in 2020, the U.S. government spent $30 million to provide foreign aid to Communist China. This has to stop. We should not send another dime to prop up a developed country that is in turn threatening the safety and security of our nation. We should instead spend this money to take care of our nation that was ravaged by COVID-19, thanks to the recklessness of Communist China."" Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott to FEMA: Taxpayers Need Answers on Biden-Schumer Scheme to Use Disaster Funding to Bailout New York 
Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) following reports that President Biden is working with Senator Chuck Schumer to give New York City and the State of New York $2 billion in additional FEMA emergency funding. Senator Scott is requesting that FEMA address these reports and provide American taxpayers with an explanation on how this plan to bailout New York’s budget shortfalls and pension plans using the Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) and other FEMA funds would affect the agency’s ability to provide critical aid following hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and other natural disasters.

Senators Rick Scott, Marco Rubio Introduce Legislation to Protect the Eastern Gulf of Mexico From Drilling 
Senator Rick Scott and Senator Marco Rubio re-introduced the Florida Shores Protection and Fairness Act, which would extend the moratorium on oil and gas drilling in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico from 2022 to 2032. This bill would help solidify the progress made by President Trump’s September 2020 executive actions to protect Florida’s shores.  Senator Rick Scott said, “As Governor of Florida, I fought for and secured a commitment from the Trump Administration to keep oil drilling off Florida’s coasts, and I’m glad they extended the moratorium on oil drilling for another 10 years. I’m proud to join Senator Rubio today to put this ban into law. We will never stop fighting to preserve and protect Florida’s natural resources so the state can remain a top destination for families, visitors and businesses.” Read more from Senator Rubio’s office HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott in the Miami Herald: Biden Should Stand Strong for A Free Cuba and Not Restore Failed Appeasement Policies 
Senator Rick Scott wrote an op-ed for the Miami Herald urging President-elect Joe Biden to stand up for a free Cuba and Latin America by rejecting the appeasement policies of the Obama administration, which did nothing to advance freedom in Cuba.   In the op-ed, Senator Rick Scott wrote, “Cuban Americans in Florida and across the United States want to know: What is Joe Biden’s Cuba plan? Over the past four years, the United States has taken an unprecedented stand against murderous dictators and held oppressive regimes in Latin America and Cuba accountable for their threats to regional security and human-rights abuses. This month, the State Department took an important step by reinstating Cuba to the State Sponsors of Terrorism list — a step I have urged for years. Now, President-elect Biden must make clear that the United States will not return to appeasement policies that embolden the regime and hurt the Cuban people.  
… If the Biden administration were to go backward and again remove Cuba from the State Sponsors of Terrorism list, it would give a permission slip to the regime to continue supporting terrorists and murderous dictators in Latin America. We can’t allow this to happen. We already tried appeasement, and it did not work. It exacerbated the instability and the rise of dictatorships in Latin America. We must clearly show that the United States will not tolerate rogue nations that oppress their people and serve only to destabilize the region. If we want a fighting chance at eradicating terrorism in our hemisphere, Biden must stand strong and see the Cuba for what it is — a state that harbors terrorists. 
… Returning to the policies that did nothing to advance democracy for the people of Cuba would be a mistake and an insult to the Cuban Americans who risked their lives and left their families fleeing from the regime. Biden must choose freedom over oppression, learn from the failures of past appeasement policies and stand strong for democracy in Latin America.   Weakness toward Cuba now will cost precious lives and critical ground in this important fight.""   Read the full op-ed in the Miami Herald HERE.

El Senador Rick Scott en El Nuevo Herald: Biden no debe regresar a las políticas de acercamiento con Cuba 
En caso de que se lo haya perdido, el Senador Rick Scott escribió un artículo de opinión para El Nuevo Herald donde insta al Presidente-electo Joe Biden a continuar la lucha por la libertad y democracia en Cuba y América Latina rechazando las políticas de apaciguamiento de la administración Obama que no hicieron nada para promover la libertad en Cuba.  En elartículo de opinión el Senador Rick Scott escribió, “Cubanoamericanos en la Florida y alrededor de Estados Unidos están prestando atención y quieren saber: ¿Cuál es el plan de Joe Biden para Cuba? Durante los últimos cuatro años, los Estados Unidos han adoptado una posición sin precedentes contra dictadores asesinos y responsabilizado a los regímenes opresivos de América Latina y Cuba por sus amenazas a la seguridad regional y sus abusos en contra los derechos humanos.   … Ahora, más que nunca, el presidente Biden debe dejarle saber al mundo que los Estados Unidos no volverán a las políticas de apaciguamiento que solo empoderan al régimen y lastiman al pueblo cubano.   … La posible decisión de la Administración Biden de retroceder y sacar nuevamente a Cuba de la Lista de Estados Patrocinadores del Terrorismo le daría permiso al régimen cubano de seguir apoyando a terroristas y dictadores asesinos.   … Volver a políticas que no hicieron nada para promover la democracia en Cuba sería un error y un insulto para los cubanoamericanos que arriesgaron sus vidas y dejaron a sus familias huyendo del régimen. El presidente Biden debe elegir la libertad sobre la opresión, aprender de los fracasos de las políticas de apaciguamiento del pasado y defender firmemente la democracia en América Latina. Una posición débil contra Cuba en este momento costará vidas y terreno crítico en esta importante lucha”.   Lea el artículo completo en El Nuevo Herald AQUÍ.

Fox Business: Sen. Rick Scott: ‘We should not have Florida taxpayers bailing out New York’ 
Following President Biden’s announcement of a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 spending package, Senator Rick Scott called out the numerous wasteful and unnecessary spending provisions, like billions to bailout liberal states.    Read more from the Fox Business article, Sen. Rick Scott: ‘We should not have Florida taxpayers bailing out New York’, below:   “Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., argued on Sunday that President-elect Joe Biden’s coronavirus relief plan, which calls for a $350 billion ’bailout’ for state and local governments, ‘makes no sense.'   'We shouldn’t have Florida taxpayers bailing out New York’ and other blue states for their prior problems, he stressed.   … Scott called the funding to state and local governments, specifically New York, ‘liberal payback.'   He made the comments after Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., reportedly said the state could get as much as $2 billion more in FEMA emergency money for the coronavirus pandemic through Biden’s massive relief plan.  
… Scott noted the money, which has been allocated by Congress, is ‘supposed to go for hurricanes and floods and wildfires and other natural disasters.” But instead, Scott said, Biden wants to give it to de Blasio and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo ""and say, ‘Here … I know you can’t live within your means, I know other states have paid for this, but we’re just going to give you some money just because we like you.'   'This is wrong,’ Scott said. “We shouldn’t have Florida taxpayers bailing out New York. New York cannot live within its means.  'We cannot be bailing out these states for their prior problems,’ he added, noting that billions of dollars have already been allocated to states and local governments for COVID-19 relief.  'We should help on COVID relief, I want targeted help for people, but to bail out these blue states makes no sense,’ Scott stressed…""  Read the full article in Fox Business HERE.

Week of January 17, 2021   INAUGURATION

On Wednesday, for the 46th time, the world looked on as our nation underwent a peaceful transition of power - the hallmark of our great democracy. 

Joe Biden was sworn in as President of the United States and Kamala Harris as Vice President of the United States, and I am praying for them and for our country. As Ronald Reagan so accurately put it, ""in the eyes of many in the world, this every-four-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle.""

PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM
 
The Paycheck Protection Program is back open!

This past week, the SBA issued 60,000 loans and over $5 billion is on its way to keeping small businesses open and Texas workers on the payroll. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and we need to make sure they survive the pandemic. After all, the forced shutdowns and closures are not a fault of their own. 

I encourage everyone to continue shopping locally and supporting our entrepreneurs when you can. For more information on the Paycheck Protection Program, click here.

COVID-19 VACCINE INFO

Many of you have recently reached out to me regarding COVID-19 vaccine distribution in Tarrant, Ellis, and Navarro Counties. As your Congressman, the health and safety of our district continues to be my top priority and I wanted to pass along some important information on vaccination efforts in our community. 

The Texas Division of Emergency Management has a statewide COVID-19 vaccine provider map that shows all Texas vaccine providers. This map provides contact information for each provider as well as the number of available doses each provider has of the COVID-19 vaccine. 
 
If local supplies are limited, all Texans are able to register for any vaccine hub in Texas. To register to receive the COVID-19 vaccine from a vaccine hub visit the Texas Department of State Health Service website. Registration is also available on the Tarrant County Public Health website. If Dallas County is preferred, please visit the Dallas County Health and Human Services website to register for the COVID-19 vaccine.



KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE
 
Unfortunately, The Biden Administration is already putting in place harmful Green New Deal policies that threaten the livelihoods of millions of workers and deny affordable energy to millions more. 

As one of the President's first actions, he signed an Executive Order revoking the Keystone XL Pipeline Permit. The Keystone XL pipeline would safely move crude oil produced by our ally Canada to U.S refineries along the Gulf Coast. As Texans, we know the importance of energy made and moved in America, and that it creates jobs, lowers the cost of gas and electricity for low-income Americans, and advances American interests on the world stage.

This action will ultimately kill thousands of American jobs, reverse the progress our country has made towards energy independence, and cost rural communities millions in tax revenues.
 


THANK YOU NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS
 
After the despicable attacks on our Capitol on January 6th, there have been unprecedented measures taken to allow us to fulfill our constitutional duties as Members of Congress. I want to take this opportunity to thank the National Guard Troops who came from all across the country to protect our Capitol and allow the peaceful transition of power to happen safely. To the Texans that came to serve, thank you for all you do. I know how hard it is to leave Texas and come to Washington, it just doesn't compare!

My colleagues, staff, and I are grateful for the long, exhausting days y'all have put in protecting our beloved country. 

￼



LEGISLATIVE ACTION THIS WEEK


Cosponsorships:

TRUST in Congress Act – Rep. Spanberger: This legislation would require Members of Congress and certain family members to put investment assets into a qualified blind trust during their entire tenure in Congress. 

To award a Congressional Gold Medal to Officer Eugene Goodman – Rep. Crist: This legislation would award USCP Office Eugene Goodman a Congressional Gold Medal for “distinguished achievements and contributions” to his country. 

Day of Tears Resolution – Rep. Hice: This resolution would memorialize the unborn lives lost due to abortion by lowering the U.S. flag to half-staff on the 22nd day of January each year.

Letters:
 
Letter to OMB supporting the Houston Channel Expansion Project – Rep. Babin: I joined my fellow Texans, led by Rep. Brian Babin, to express our support for the Houston Ship Channel Expansion Project. This project will create more Texas jobs, reaffirm our commitment to American energy dominance, and build on the economic success of the Port of Houston.

BROADBAND 
Take a Speed Test Here. 
The sad fact is that many places in West Virginia simply do not have access to reliable broadband and the lack of access affects West Virginians every day. Back in 2015, the FCC released a coverage map that stated 99.9% of Americans had wireless coverage. I knew then what I know now: That is just plain wrong. 
HOW MAY WE HELP YOU? 
To request assistance from my case team, click here.  As your U.S. Senator, I am proud to be your voice with government agencies during your time of need. My goal is for me and my staff to provide the best possible customer service for every West Virginian who contacts me needing assistance. While I have no direct jurisdiction in legal or administrative matters of any federal, state, or local agency, I welcome the opportunity to assist you in any way possible and to assure that full consideration is given to your case.

JANUARY 22, 2021: MANCHIN, CAPITO, ROMNEY REINTRODUCE RESOLUTION REQUESTING STATE FUNERAL FOR LAST SURVIVING WWII MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENT  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) and Mitt Romney (R-UT) reintroduced a resolution requesting a state funeral and authorizing the use of the Capitol rotunda for the last surviving World War II Medal of Honor recipient. There are only two living Medal of Honor recipients remaining from WWII, including West Virginia native and Iwo Jima veteran, Woody Williams. This state funeral would not only recognize their individual service and sacrifice, but would act as a final salute to the Greatest Generation and those who wore the uniform from 1941 to 1945.  ""Americans like Woody Williams who answered the call to service during WWII fought to ensure our democracy prevailed. Their sacrifices allowed the rest of us to enjoy the freedoms we hold sacred and helped make the United States the best country in the world,"" Senator Manchin said. ""Bestowing this great honor on the last surviving WWII Medal of Honor recipient would be the perfect way to come together as a nation to salute the Greatest Generation. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join us in our efforts to honor these brave Veterans and call on President Biden to grant our request."" 
JANUARY 22, 2021: MANCHIN VOTES TO CONFIRM SECRETARY OF DEFENSE AUSTIN  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, voted to confirm Retired General Lloyd Austin as the United States Secretary of Defense.  ""Today I voted to confirm Lloyd Austin as Secretary of Defense. His confirmation is the beginning of a long journey to reestablish American leadership around the globe and rebuild trust in our federal government. After meeting with Secretary Austin and questioning him during his nomination hearing, I truly believe he is the right person to lead the Department of Defense. His more than 40 year career of serving in a subordinate nature to civilian authority provides a unique background to reinforce the example of civilian leadership of our military, and that example is desperately needed as we return to a sense of normalcy. I look forward to working with Secretary Austin as we restore America’s role in upholding democratic ideals at home and across the world."" 
JANUARY 22, 2021: MANCHIN VISITS WEST VIRGINIA NATIONAL GUARD TROOPS DEPLOYED TO WASHINGTON  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, visited with West Virginia National Guard troops deployed to Washington, DC.  ""This morning I met with West Virginia National Guard troops deployed to Washington, DC following the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6th to personally thank them for protecting our Capitol with honor and continuing to show what it truly means to be a West Virginian. I am incredibly proud of these West Virginia sons and daughters and I encourage my fellow West Virginians to thank our troops for representing the Mountain State here in Washington during these difficult times and wish them a safe return home.""  To view pictures of Senator Manchin and the National Guard troops, please click here.

I extend my most sincere congratulations to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on their inauguration. Every American should want our President to succeed because if our President does well, our nation and state do well. I will do everything in my power to work with President Biden to help heal our county and to govern in the most bipartisan way because it should be about our country, democracy, the rule of law and saving our republic. We must come together to heal this political divide. God bless America.""

JANUARY 19, 2021: MANCHIN, CAPITO ANNOUNCE $975,000 FOR AEROSPACE MECHANIC TRAINING SCHOOL AT MARSHALL UNIVERSITY  Washington, DC - U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $975,000 from the Economic Development Administration (EDA) to support the launch of the Aerospace Mechanic Technician (AMT) Training School at Marshall University. This program will assist with supplying needed jobs to the aerospace industry and will help create new job opportunities and attract private investment to Cabell County.  ""The Marshall Aerospace Mechanic Training School at Huntington Tri-State provides West Virginians with high quality training to ensure they are prepared for future opportunities across West Virginia. I am pleased the EDA is investing in this great program and as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee I will continue to fight for funding that supports educating West Virginians to fill jobs right here in the Mountain State,"" said Senator Manchin.

WV STRONG
I was always taught that if you can count your blessings, you can share your blessings. I’ve been seeing so many great WV Strong and Better Angels stories. During these unprecedented times, it’s important to focus on all the wonderful things that are still happening every day in our beautiful state. 
Nominated as today’s Better Angels are the staff and volunteers at Christian Help in Kermit, which recently celebrated its 25th anniversary. During the holiday season, this group creates an annual Christmas Distribution event to help families celebrate by supplying gifts and food. This year, their plans were altered due to the pandemic, but it did not stop them from finding a safe way to help their fellow West Virginians have a happy and healthy Christmas. They organized a drive-through event with minimal contact between the families and volunteers and it was a wonderful start to the Christmas season. Thank you all for organizing this annual event and representing your special community so well. 
Please continue sharing your stories of hope, joy, and volunteerism by emailing your nomination and a photo to WVSTRONG@manchin.senate.gov .

JANUARY 21, 2021: MANCHIN RECEIVES VACCINE UPDATE FROM COO OF OPERATION WARP SPEED  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) received an update from General Gus Perna, Chief Operating Officer of Operation Warp Speed on COVID-19 vaccine procurement and distribution.  ""Our state needs vaccines, plain and simple. Today I spoke with General Gus Perna, Chief Operating Officer of Operation Warp Speed, to discuss the procurement and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. Until the Biden Administration’s plan kicks in, General Perna assured me West Virginia should continue receiving no less than the doses it is currently receiving. Unfortunately, the press reports are accurate and there is no federal stockpile of vaccine doses. However, as the Biden Administration ramps up manufacturing, they expect to see an increase in the number of doses distributed to each state beginning in early February. As soon as vaccine doses come off the production line, the Biden Administration intends to ship them directly to states, in a transparent manner. They believe doses will steadily increase over the coming months ensuring more Americans and West Virginians can receive this vital vaccine. I will continue to advocate for more vaccine doses until West Virginia receives enough to vaccinate every patient that wants one."" 
JANUARY 20, 2021: MANCHIN WORKING WITH BIDEN ADMINISTRATION ON VACCINE DISTRIBUTION IN WEST VIRGINIA  Washington, DC - Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) issued the following statement about COVID-19 vaccine distribution in West Virginia.   ""I am aware of the scarcity of the COVID-19 vaccine throughout West Virginia and remain disappointed by the Trump Administration’s failure to get these vaccines to the people that need them. Congress has provided significant funding to make more vaccines available to more people, including nearly $9 billion in the most recent COVID-19 relief package. I am working with the incoming Biden Administration to get more vaccines to West Virginia, so that state and local leaders can plan for the appropriate vaccines they should have had all along. While it may take some time to right the ship, help is on the way.”

How We Build a Stronger America
This week I had the honor of witnessing Joe Biden and Kamala Harris take their oaths of office to be the next President and Vice President of the United States. At this crossroads in our nation’s history, President Biden called on all of us to recommit to our shared values to build a stronger, more equitable country where all Americans have the opportunity to succeed. As he reminded us, there is no challenge that Americans can’t conquer when we come together.    I am ready to get to work with President Biden, Vice President Harris, and my colleagues – Republicans and Democrats – to serve all Americans. Together, we can and must begin recovering from this devastating virus that has taken more than 400,000 Americans and left so many people struggling.  I’m also eager to work across the aisle in this new Congress to tackle some of the other pressing challenges that our state is facing, including lowering the cost of health care, combating the substance misuse epidemic, and helping to ensure that our country remains safe, secure, and free.  There’s no doubt that we have a lot of work to do, and I’ll continue to fight to get results for the people of New Hampshire. 
With every good wish,  ￼   Senator Maggie Hassan 
What the Senator is Working On
Senator Hassan and the New Hampshire Congressional Delegation announced a $575,000 federal grant through the U.S. Department of Education to help New Hampshire expand access to career pathway opportunities and prepare students for careers in STEM-oriented fields.

January 22, 2020
 
 
Dear Friend,
 
This week, we saw the historic inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, and now we begin the hard work of healing our deeply divided nation, crushing COVID-19, and building back better. While I am optimistic about the future of our country, I know that we face a difficult road ahead. On Tuesday, we reached a grim milestone – 400,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, including more than 900 Granite Staters.
 Despite all the hardships last year brought, there are many accomplishments to celebrate as we begin 2021 and the first session of the 117th Congress. From passing COVID relief legislation for American workers, families, and businesses, to the development of two safe, effective COVID vaccines, to passing the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), there is much to be proud of as we look back on what will long be remembered as an extremely trying time for our nation.
 
 
 
Passing Bipartisan COVID-19 Relief
 
 
 
 
￼
 
 
 
I was glad last month when the House and Senate came to an agreement to pass much-needed COVID-19 relief, fund the government, and prevent a shutdown, but it was long overdue. This legislation was a down payment, not a long-term solution. The bipartisan bill we passed did not include everything we had been fighting for, but it provided critical support for our health care systems and vaccine distribution capacity, increased funding for small businesses, and extended unemployment benefits for Granite Staters who are out of work.
 I am pleased that we were able to secure key New Hampshire priorities that I advocated for, including bolstered funding for job-creating projects through the Northern Border Regional Commission, additional help for small farms and families struggling with food insecurity, increased funding for mental health and addiction treatment, and new housing support for low-income families and survivors of sexual violence.

This legislation included vaccine distribution funding modeled after a bill I led earlier last year with Congressman Hakeem Jeffries. I reintroduced an updated version of the bill this week - the Coronavirus Vaccine and Therapeutic Development Act invests in manufacturing capacity for COVID-19 vaccines and therapies to ensure our supply can meet demand targets to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19. 
While the bipartisan package we passed at the end of 2020 provided some relief to those who need it most, we must do more to support Granite Staters and all Americans during this health and economic crisis. On December 28, I voted to increase the $600 compromise payments to $2,000. In 2021, I will continue working to ensure Americans have access to the support and resources they need to get through this pandemic.
 
 
 
Helping Live Venues and Performance Spaces Stay Afloat
 
  
Key provisions of the Save Our Stages Act, which I co sponsored last year, were also included in the latest COVID relief spending package. The coronavirus pandemic and necessary public health measures have taken a tremendous financial toll on the state of New Hampshire, and our live music and performance industry has been hit particularly hard. In addition to providing general enjoyment to the public, these venues also play a meaningful role in the economic wellbeing of communities, and I’m proud this beneficial legislation was included in the omnibus spending package.
 
 
 
Safe, Effective COVID-19 Vaccines
 
  
Earlier in the year, my legislation to ensure the country is prepared to mass-produce and equitably distribute a vaccine passed as part of the HEROES Act. The FDA authorization of two safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines at the end of 2020 represented a light at the end of the tunnel. In order to fully reopen our economy, put the COVID-19 pandemic behind us, and move onto our “new normal,” the majority of Americans will need to be vaccinated for the virus. Both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines have proven to be more than 94% effective, and additional vaccines are expected to be authorized soon. I’m hopeful that we will be able to put the pandemic behind us in the not-too-distant future, but in the meantime, we must continue taking precautions to protect ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities.
 
 
 
Combating Pandemic Scams
 
  
In November, the Combating Pandemic Scams Act of 2020 — bipartisan legislation I helped introduce — passed the House of Representatives. During these challenging times for our country, I have been deeply moved by Americans’ commitment to helping their neighbors through this crisis. Sadly, where many see an opportunity to lend a helping hand, some see a chance to make a quick buck by scamming unsuspecting victims. This bipartisan legislation will help to protect some of the most vulnerable members of our communities and crackdown on scams by keeping the American people informed of these devious efforts. I’m glad my colleagues joined together in support of this commonsense measure. 
 
 
 
Providing Updates to Keep Granite Staters Informed
 
  
Congressman Pappas and I held over a dozen telephone town halls in 2020 to keep Granite State communities updated on federal efforts to support and protect people in New Hampshire and across the country during the COVID-19 pandemic and provide opportunities for Granite Staters to ask questions. During these calls, we were joined by state medical leaders and experts such as Dr. Beth Daily, Chief of the Bureau of Infectious Disease Control at the NH Department of Health and Human Services; Dr. Benjamin Chan, State Epidemiologist; George Copadis, Commissioner of NH Employment Security; Dr. Michael Calderwood, Dartmouth-Hitchcock Epidemiologist and Infectious Disease Expert, and others. We hosted our most recent town hall on December 16th to update New Hampshire residents about bipartisan relief legislation, phases of vaccine distribution, transmission rates in the state, and federal funding for workers and businesses. I look forward to holding more town halls to keep Granite Staters in the loop on what’s happening as we work to crush this pandemic. 
 
 
 
Passing the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)
 
 
 Over the summer, the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which contains multiple provisions I helped advance, including reopening the child care facility at the Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory in Hanover, investigating the causes of high unemployment rates for post-9/11 women veterans, and improving the Department of Defense’s efforts to prevent overdose deaths. The legislation became law earlier this month and it strengthens the Department of Defense’s ability to protect Americans from viruses like COVID-19, provides a pay raise for service members, and prevents the U.S. from resuming nuclear weapons testing.
 
 
 
Protecting Veteran-Owned Small Businesses
 
 
 I was pleased the House passed the Protecting Business Opportunities for Veterans Act of 2019 last February. When a business has the privilege of being awarded a contract through the Vets First Program, they must keep their end of the bargain and perform the work that is required of them. This legislation, which became law late last year, helps enforce that basic fairness and prevents qualified businesses from being unfairly ignored for contracting opportunities. I was proud to introduce this commonsense legislation and I will continue my work to support our veterans and ensure they have access to the services they deserve.
 
 
 
Improving Veterans' Access to Health Care
 
  
In September, the House passed multiple pieces of legislation I backed to improve access to health care for Granite State veterans. The VA Mission Telehealth Clarification Act would improve and expand access to telehealth services for veterans and the Equal Access to Contraception for Veterans Act would help female veterans access contraception. The men and women who have served our nation in uniform deserve access to the best health care and services possible. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever to ensure that telehealth services are available to the men and women who served so that they are able to safely access care from home. Comprehensive health care includes access to contraception and the legislation we advanced takes important steps to improve access to contraception for women veterans. I will continue to work across the aisle to stand up for Granite State veterans and their families. 
 
 
 
Expanding Access to Quality Health Care
 
 
￼
  
My conversation with NH Health Care Association Leadership & Members
 
 
As we continue to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, access to affordable, quality health care is critical. Throughout 2020, I held several discussions on this issue. In November, I had a conversation with New Hampshire Health Care Association leadership and members to discuss the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on long-term care facilities in the state. It is critical that we make sure health care workers have the support and equipment they need to do their jobs and save lives. Hearing directly from those on the frontlines at the NH Health Care Association is vital and I will continue to bring their voices to Congress and fight to ensure those on the frontlines of this pandemic have everything they need to weather this storm. 
 
In August, I held a roundtable discussion on the response to COVID-19 in the North Country. Ensuring access to quality, affordable care in rural areas like the North Country was already a challenge, and the COVID-19 pandemic has made it all the more difficult. The health care leaders I spoke to in this conversation are committed to providing Granite Staters with the care they need, while also keeping them safe through the use of services like telehealth appointments — a tool that will remain critical in rural areas even after the pandemic is behind us. 
 
 
￼
  
My discussion on COVID-19 in the North Country
 
 
I also held two virtual roundtable discussions in August with leaders and providers in the substance misuse, mental health, and health care fields to receive updates on the impacts of COVID-19. The health and economic crisis caused by COVID-19 has created significant challenges for Granite State health care, mental health, and substance use treatment providers — at the same time, we are seeing increases in substance abuse and mental illness across New Hampshire. I was glad to hear from these hard-working Granite Staters, whose insights will continue to guide my work in Congress as we respond to this pandemic. 
 
In July, the House passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Enhancement Act to increase access to affordable care, lower the cost of prescription drugs, and combat racial and ethnic disparities in our health care system. I’m proud this legislation includes provisions from my bill, the Protecting Americans with Pre-existing Conditions Act, to eliminate junk health plans, which often lack protections for the millions of Americans living with a preexisting condition. 
 
 
 
Increasing Access to Prevention, Treatment and Recovery for Opioid Use Disorder
 
 
 
 
￼
 
 
In March, the Bipartisan Opioid Task Force unveiled its 2020 legislative agenda. This ambitious slate of legislation would significantly bolster our response to the nation’s evolving addiction crisis. Every bill is bipartisan, and our agenda tackles underlying challenges in our criminal justice and economic systems that have contributed to this crisis. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to advance our agenda and bolster prevention efforts, access to long-term treatment and recovery, and support interdiction and law enforcement. 
In November, the House passed H.R. 2466, the State Opioid Response Grant Authorization Act of 2020, the Easy MAT for Opioid Addiction Act, and the Block, Report, and Suspend Shipments Act of 2020, all of which were included in the Bipartisan Opioid Task Force’s Legislative Agenda. As the Founder of the Task Force, I’ve focused on bringing together Republicans and Democrats to drive congressional action to respond to the substance abuse crisis that has devastated communities in New Hampshire and across the country. These bills will help ensure those who are struggling with substance use disorder can get the care and support they need and prevent the distribution of illicit narcotics. 
 
 
 
Addressing and Preventing Sexual Violence
 
  
In July, I was proud to join Representatives Jackie Speier, David Joyce, and John Katko — my co-chairs on the Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence — to unveil the Task Force’s legislative agenda. In the nearly four years since we first launched the Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence, our nation has seen an evolution in terms of how this abhorrent behavior is addressed across every facet of our society. Despite this progress, the challenges that remain are tremendous and we have a long way to go before the elimination of sexual violence. In October, the House passed the Empowering Olympic, Paralympic, and Amateur Athletes Act, which I helped introduce and later became law. These athletes and their families put their complete trust in the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) and its personnel, and tragically that trust has sometimes been violated. With the passage of this legislation, Congress made clear that abuse of athletes will not be tolerated nor swept under the rug. We must ensure the safety and wellbeing of our young athletes. I’m committed to working with the members of the Olympic community who have dedicated themselves to keeping our athletes safe as we look ahead to the games in 2021.
 
 
 
Roundtable Discussions on Combating Sexual Violence
 
  
The Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence held several roundtable discussions on addressing sexual violence in 2020. In December, we held a virtual discussion on racial disparities in access to care and justice for survivors of sexual violence. The Task Force was joined by survivors of color and discussed reforms and changes that need to be made to address the disparities. You can read more about that discussion here. 
 
 
￼
  
The Task Force discussion on racial disparities in access to care
 
In October, I held a virtual conversation with sexual and domestic violence prevention advocates to discuss and celebrate the passage of the Every Voice Act in the New Hampshire legislature. The Every Voice Act, which takes effect this month, enacts comprehensive measures to combat sexual violence and support survivors on New Hampshire’s college campuses. Read more about that discussion here. 
 
 
￼
  
My discussion with sexual violence prevention advocates
  
Earlier in October, the Bipartisan Task Force to End Sexual Violence held a virtual roundtable discussion on addressing human trafficking in the United States. The Task Force members and panelists discussed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rates and prosecution of human trafficking crimes – including the implications of prisons being emptied to reduce transmission and the financial impacts of the pandemic on vulnerable populations and those at risk of trafficking. Read more about the discussion here. 
 
 
￼
  
Our discussion on human trafficking
 
In July, the Task Force held a virtual roundtable conversation to discuss how state and local organizations that combat sexual violence are navigating the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The roundtable also examined how the virus has exacerbated racial disparities in access to care. 
In June, the Task Force held a virtual roundtable discussion about addressing sexual and domestic violence during the COVID-19 pandemic. Panelists and Task Force members discussed a variety of new challenges facing those working to combat sexual and domestic violence, such as financial and manpower strains on shelters, the need for emergency federal funding for survivor support programs, and disturbing trends in reporting since the pandemic began. Read more about the panel discussion here. 
In February, the Task Force hosted a roundtable discussion on ensuring access to shelters and affordable housing for survivors of sexual and domestic violence. 
 
 
 
The Road to Recovery from COVID-19
 
 
In June, I co-sponsored the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act, which became law that month and provides flexibility to the PPP to make critical funds more accessible to small businesses that are facing economic challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
I was proud to unveil my 2020 Jobs and Opportunity Agenda in October. This agenda outlines proposals that can help us build back better by taking steps to invest in our current workforce and helping those who are out of work land new jobs. By providing businesses with the resources they need to get through this crisis, we can make sure our economy is positioned to quickly recover when the public health situation allows. My agenda also advances policies that expand access to affordable child care so that Granite Staters can get back to work and know that their children are in a safe place while they are working. The policies I have outlined are a down payment on the future of our country, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance these measures.
I joined House Majority Whip James E. Clyburn and members of the House Rural Broadband Task Force and other House Democrats in June to introduce the Accessible, Affordable Internet for All Act. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for all Americans to have a reliable internet connection as students have moved from classrooms to remote learning, patients are receiving telehealth care from the safety of their own homes, and many employees are working remotely. Having a reliable internet connection will continue to be essential as we move past this pandemic and begin our ‘new normal.’
In July, the House passed H.R. 7617, the second annual appropriations package to provide robust funding for infrastructure, public health, education, job training and our national defense. I worked closely with my House colleagues to ensure increased funding for community health centers and food banks, address the opioid crisis, and protect survivors of sexual and domestic violence. From preventing the Department of Justice from spending taxpayer dollars on efforts to repeal the ACA, to expanding Pell Grants and increasing funding for Head Start, this bill will help to support communities during this pandemic, keep Americans safe, and invest in the future of our economy. 
In August, I hosted a virtual roundtable discussion with NH Business and Program Administrators to discuss COVID-19 relief funding and hear about their experiences with the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and state grant programs funded under the CARES Act. I was proud to share the valuable input and stories I heard during this discussion with my colleagues as we continue our efforts to help businesses endure these challenging times. By working together, we can safely restore our economy and protect New Hampshire’s thriving business community. 
I was also proud to introduce legislation with Congressman Brian Fitzpatrick to provide $25,000 in either student loan debt relief or education benefits to essential workers and their family members. Essential workers risk their health and wellbeing every day to keep our society functioning during this unprecedented pandemic. Thanks to their courage, Granite Staters are able to buy food for their families, call for help during an emergency, and receive treatment if they are sick. We owe these heroes a debt of gratitude. This legislation will honor their service by allowing essential workers to pay off student debt and have the opportunity - should they want it - to further their education or learn new skills once the crisis has subsided. 
 
 
 
Confronting Racial Injustice
 
 
 
￼
 
 
As a nation, we must acknowledge that systemic racism and inequality in treatment by law enforcement are pervasive within our society and work to end these injustices. That’s why I was proud to vote in favor of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which passed the House in June. It is in every American’s best interest to ensure our nation’s police officers are held to the highest standard and enact safeguards to protect the public, prohibit federal and state law enforcement from using racial profiling, and ensure that police are held accountable to the communities they serve.
This legislation, which I was an original cosponsor of, is a long-overdue step towards ensuring equal justice for all Americans. It will provide law enforcement with enhanced training to mandate demanding situations, improve transparency, enact structural change, hold perpetrators of police brutality accountable for their actions, and keep all Americans safe. 
I also unveiled my Opportunity and Justice for All Agenda in June, which highlights legislation that I am supporting to address institutional racism and help create a more just society for all Americans. Our nation has a long, painful history of racial inequality and discrimination that touches nearly every aspect of our society. This agenda includes bills that have been introduced in Congress to help our nation right some of the wrongs of our past, dismantle inequalities that permeate our culture, and create a more just society for all Americans. No single piece of legislation can erase the prejudice and oppression so many marginalized communities face or our nation’s complicated history surrounding race, but Congress must work to build a more perfect union that establishes opportunity and justice for all.
In September, I spoke with NH Department of Safety Commissioner Robert Quinn to discuss recommendations from the state’s Commission on Law Enforcement Accountability, Community and Transparency (LEACT) on police training and standards. I deeply appreciated the opportunity to speak with Commissioner Quinn, and I applaud him and the LEACT Commission for their dedication to shepherding critical police reforms in our state. This was accomplished the New Hampshire way, identifying common-sense solutions through collaboration on the Commission from many community partners including civil liberties, non-profit, community, legal and law enforcement leaders. I look forward to our continued work together to increase transparency and justice in law enforcement and ensure the police are held accountable to the communities they serve. 
 
 
 
Preserving and Protecting Our Environment
 
 
In July, I voted in favor of the Great American Outdoors Act, which became law. This bipartisan legislation includes full and permanent funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) for the first time in the program’s 56 year history. As a life-long outdoor enthusiast, I was so proud to support this historic conservation bill. Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) funds have already helped our state and communities preserve lands ranging from city parks to forest wilderness to drinking water sources. And with the program fully funded for the first time, we anticipate New Hampshire will receive about $4.5 million annually as we continue these conservation efforts. The bill will also help address the more than $43 million in backlogged maintenance projects that have already been identified on public lands in New Hampshire. With so many of us eager to get outside and safely social distance in nature during this pandemic, now is the time to ensure these special lands are protected and maintained.
I joined my colleagues in July to introduce the Scenic Trail Viewshed Protection Act, which will help protect our national scenic trails, like the Appalachian Trail here in the Granite State, by requiring stricter evaluation of natural gas pipeline projects that seek to cross these trails or their surrounding viewsheds. I have long been concerned about natural gas pipeline development being prioritized over environmental protection and conservation. We cannot afford to leave these trails vulnerable to poorly planned pipelines. I will continue my efforts to preserve the outdoor spaces we cherish so deeply.
 
 
Upgrading Our Nation's Infrastructure
 
 I was proud to join my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R.2, the Moving Forward Act, which passed the House in July. In New Hampshire, commuter rail would be a gamechanger, helping to spur economic competitiveness and preventing Granite Staters from needlessly spending hours in traffic. This legislation includes provisions from my Invest in American Railroads Act that would support efforts to expand commuter rail in the Granite State and across the country. The Moving Forward Act will ensure that our nation is adequately investing in our infrastructure to build a smarter, safer, and more resilient America, and it will make critical improvements to our health care system, broadband access, and more. I will continue working to secure funding to expand commuter rail and upgrade our infrastructure in the Granite State. 
 
 
 
Supporting Local Agriculture
 
 
In May, Representatives Jeff Fortenberry, Chellie Pingree, and I introduced a bill to waive matching fund requirements for agriculture businesses who receive funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) through the Farmers Market and Local Food Promotion Program (FMPP and LFPP) and Value Added Producer Grants (VAPG). These are all fantastic programs that help farmers diversify their operations and connect with local consumers - a win-win for both ends of the food supply chain. My legislation recognizes that our farms need this support now more than ever by waiving the matching requirements to secure these grants through 2021. 
I also led a group of 19 Members of Congress in sending a letter to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue urging the USDA to ensure as much food as possible purchased through the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) is locally sourced and procured from small and mid-sized producers. Small farms are the backbone of our nation. They comprise the vast majority of agriculture businesses, sustain our rural economies, and feed their fellow Americans from coast to coast. Their ability to weather the current crisis is critical to sustaining our food supply, both now and in the years ahead. 
I joined Representatives Marcia Fudge, Cheri Bustos, and Chellie Pingree in leading a group of 19 House Democrats in a letter to the USDA to sound the alarm on the department’s failure to help small farms, farmers of color, beginning, minority and veteran farmers, and others through its implementation of direct payments to farmers and ranchers under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, and the Farmers to Families Food Box Program. In August, I visited Sanborn Mills Farm in Loudon to discuss this issue. I appreciated the opportunity to hear from Sanborn Mills leadership, as their insights have been invaluable while my colleagues and I continue our efforts to help farms of all sizes weather the COVID-19 crisis.

Looking Ahead to 2021
 
 
With the historic inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris this week, our nation has turned the page on a dark chapter in American history. I look forward to continuing my work on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and to rejoining the House Agriculture Committee.
 
I’m glad that the Biden-Harris administration has made ending the COVID-19 pandemic a top priority, and I am confident that with their commitment to following the science, as well as the experience and expertise of public health officials like Dr. Anthony Fauci, we will be able to move past this pandemic towards a brighter future.
 
 
 
News You Can Use
 
 
Beginning today, New Hampshire kicked off Phase 1B of vaccinations. I had a call with the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services to discuss the status of our state's vaccine rollout, and I was pleased to hear over 100,000 Granite Staters were able to successfully register through the state's website.
Residents aged 65 and over are encouraged to visit vaccines.nh.gov to register and schedule their COVID-19 vaccination. According to the state, after you register, you can expect a confirmation email within 3-5 days that will include a link to schedule your appointment. If you do not have access to a computer or an internet connection, you can call 2-1-1 for assistance. If you are younger than 65 but believe that your underlying health conditions meet the criteria for Phase 1B, contact your primary health provider.
 
As always, the CDC and the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services are the best resources to turn to during the COVID-19 public health emergency. If you are sick, stay home and call your health care provider. If you live in NH and have questions about coronavirus, dial 2-1-1 or visit CDC.gov for more information.

Sincerely,

President Biden inaugurated

President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were sworn into office Wednesday in a ceremony at the U.S. Capitol, where, just two weeks before, a mob of domestic terrorists had tried to prevent Congress from certifying the presidential election. Biden focused his heartfelt inaugural address on the need for Americans to work together on the multiple crises facing our nation: COVID and the economic calamity the disease has caused, racial disparities, and the global climate. In a sense, the election of Kamala Harris as the first Asian American and first woman elected to national office, showed Americans are willing to be inclusive and want to heal the wounds of disparity. Also, widely praised at the event was the poetry of twenty-two-year-old Amanda Gorman, who urged us all to “leave behind a country better than one we were left…” and “raise this wounded world into a wondrous one.” An inspiring way to begin the next four years. 
￼
￼

Looking ahead to the 117th Congress. On Monday, I shared a video message for you, my constituents, to reflect on the recent events at the Capitol and reaffirm my oath to work for you. With all of you, together, I have faith we can accomplish even more this next Congress, all in the name of goodness, justice, and love for our people, for our islands, and for our nation. 
￼

Add Marianas to SNAP

Three committee chairs are among thirteen original cosponsors of legislation adding the Marianas to the national food assistance program (SNAP). I reintroduced the AYUDA Act on Thursday. First put forward in 2011, the bill is better positioned to advance in this Congress. I have a new seat on the Agriculture Committee, which has jurisdiction over the bill, and incoming chair David Scott was a cosponsor in 2011. Even though the Ayuda Act did not move forward, then, I was able to get a study of the feasibility of adding the Marianas to SNAP and an extra $30.5 million for the existing food stamp program, some of which was still available for use in this fiscal year. But my ultimate goal remains SNAP, so people in the Marianas have the same food safety protections as other Americans. Even though I got an extra $25 million for the Marianas in 2019 and another $14 million extra last year, the current block grant approach to food aid continues to fall short. Witness: Governor Torres’ removal of households from eligibility and 25 percent benefits slash last October because of funding uncertainties. I have urged the Governor to restore these households and reverse the benefit cuts, now that more funds are available. 
￼

Medicaid cap repeal gains support

The Insular Area Medicaid Parity Act now has 43 cosponsors and gained the support of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials this week. ASTHO wrote: 
“U.S. Territories should not have to rely on supplemental, temporary funding to provide quality healthcare to their residents. Prioritizing this legislation in the 117th session of Congress supports our vision of advancing health equity and optimal health for all.”
ASTHO joins a growing coalition of organizations calling for a repeal of the Territorial Medicaid cap. These organizations include: Equally American, Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations, National Council of Asian Pacific Americans, Catholic Health Association of the United States, National Association of Community Health Centers, Families USA, Hispanic Federation, and Bipartisan Policy Center Action. Thank you for your support of my legislation.

$14m for Northern Marianas College

Northern Marianas College is receiving $13,978,909.74 in federal funding to repair and replace buildings damaged by Super Typhoon Yutu in 2018, the Federal Emergency Management Agency announced on Thursday. Yutu brought catastrophic damages to 13 campus buildings. Four will be repaired to pre-disaster condition by replacement of ceilings, roofs, doors, exterior walls, flooring, interior walls, lighting, fire alarm, and security systems, the local area network and computer system components, HVAC Systems, air conditioning units, and all exterior components. Because the other nine buildings suffered more than 50 percent of their market value in damage, they are eligible for complete replacement. Eleven of the College buildings will be specially reinforced to withstand future typhoon events. Congratulations, NMC.

Reviewing the legislative agenda. Representatives of the Society for Human Resource Management met with me on Thursday to discuss current legislation in Congress relevant to SHRM. Creating a better workplace, where employers and employees thrive together, is a goal we all share.

1/22/21 18:04,Senator Bennet’s Weekly Update,"A message from Senator Michael Bennet 
￼
Hello everyone,  
Wednesday was a great day to be an American. Days after a mob stormed the U.S. Capitol, both parties and all three branches of government gathered on its steps to celebrate the transfer of power to the Biden Administration. I brought my daughter Halina so she could witness the first woman in U.S. history to be sworn in as Vice President. It was a poignant moment and a powerful affirmation of our democracy. I deeply appreciated President Biden’s words in the inaugural address, and in the days ahead I hope we all take seriously his call for unity in this difficult moment.
￼ 
Not since FDR has an administration faced such formidable challenges – a public health crisis, an economic crisis, a climate crisis, and the most bitter partisan divisions in living memory. The Biden Administration now has a historic opportunity to earn the American people’s confidence by leading with integrity, governing with competence, and pursuing an agenda that will make a real difference in their lives.  
In his first days in office, President Biden signed dozens of executive orders to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, end the “Muslim ban”, freeze construction of the border wall, require masks on federal property, and more.  
￼ 
He’s developing a national strategy for testing and equipment, which I called for last March. He’s also proposed a plan for comprehensive immigration reform, the first serious proposal since the 2013 bill I helped write and pass in the Senate. 
At the same time, the Biden Administration has put forward several ideas to bridge us from the pandemic into a growing economy, and I look forward to working closely with the administration to pass this agenda -- especially my bills to expand the child tax credit and surge our public health response with a new Health Force. Those two items alone would make an enormous difference for families and frontline workers across the country, and I could easily add several more proposals to our agenda this year. 
￼ 
(Watch my interview with CBS4 on my plan to cut childhood poverty by 45%) 
We have so much work ahead, but I for one am energized by the challenge. 
Onward, 
￼  Michael

January 22, 2021 


Earlier this week, we took time to reflect on the vision, the mission, and the dream of the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. His birthday calls on us to reevaluate our progress in fulfilling what he called the “promissory note” of equal rights, equal justice, and equal opportunity in our nation. Dr. King often preached that “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice” – he also knew that it doesn’t bend on its own. Each of us has a responsibility to participate in our democracy, confront social and racial injustice in all its forms, and bend that arc further and faster. As we turn the page on this dark chapter in American history, our country must move forward armed with the spirit and wisdom of Dr. King’s message. 
Celebrating a New Day
Wednesday marked the beginning of a new chapter for our country. We witnessed the historic swearing-in of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as our next President and Vice President of the United States. I was moved to watch Vice President Harris take her oath of office on the bible owned by a son of Baltimore and barrier-breaking Supreme Court Justice, Thurgood Marshall. And I was inspired by President Biden’s call for unity over division, as he addressed our nation for the first time as Commander-In-Chief. 
President Biden and Vice President Harris have pledged to serve each and every American – both those who voted for them and those who didn’t. While our nation now faces some of the most difficult challenges in our history, I am committed to working with the new Administration and my colleagues in Congress to meet these problems head-on. Together, we must work to heal our country, stride boldly into the future, and pursue a more perfect, just, and equal union. 
Tackling the Challenges at Hand
Our top priority must be to beat this pandemic and bring relief to those hardest hit by the economic fallout of this crisis. Marylanders are still struggling to make ends meet and are seeking action amid the growing challenges in vaccine rollout and the climbing death toll, which has now surpassed 400,000 in the United States. I’m glad that lawmakers came together in December to pass another bipartisan stimulus bill and was pleased to join the Maryland delegation last week to announce that $400 million will go to expanding our state’s vaccine distribution, contact tracing, and testing capacity. But much work remains to be done, and we must pass more emergency relief now. 
Fighting the COVID-19 pandemic requires an all-hands-on-deck approach. I’m glad to see the Biden Administration hit the ground running with their national strategy to fully mobilize the federal government and improve coordination with state and local governments to overcome this pandemic. And I support President Biden’s comprehensive plan, which will help us tackle the coronavirus head-on by boosting our capacity to vaccinate, test for, and treat this disease. From the start, I have urged the Executive Branch to make full use of the Defense Production Act to generate the necessary supplies to fight the pandemic, and I am glad President Biden is moving quickly to do so. Biden’s strategy also includes support for our state and local governments – a priority I’ve repeatedly pressed for – by providing new funds and increasing the federal cost share for FEMA and National Guard assistance to 100 percent. Critically, this plan confronts the child care crisis, prioritizes the safe reopening of schools, and will provide our students and educators with more resources to improve learning at this challenging time. President Biden’s plan also commits to addressing the disparate impact of this pandemic on communities of color and will help tackle these challenges by improving community-based services. Last but not least, this new strategy lays the groundwork to reopen our economy and build back better. I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress to implement and build on this plan. I also support President Biden’s earlier-released American Rescue Plan, which will increase the $600 payments by an additional $1,400, bringing the total relief payment to $2,000 per eligible person, among other key provisions. It’s time to move full-steam ahead. 
The coronavirus has also shone a harsh light on the deeper, structural challenges facing our nation that we must confront at their source. We need to build back better – with an emphasis on “better.” I will fight to build a dynamic economy that works for everyone, root out systemic racism in all its forms, and address the threat of the climate crisis by investing in clean energy and making polluters pay – and I look forward to partnering with the Biden-Harris Administration to meet these pressing challenges with urgency. I’m pleased that the new Administration has already moved forward with executive actions to tackle the pandemic, promote equity, and protect our planet. Congress has a responsibility to pass legislation alongside these vital efforts, and I will work every day in the halls of the Senate to achieve that goal. 
Defying Insurrection
In order to march toward the future, we need to resolve the unfinished business of the past. Make no mistake: while serving as Commander-in-Chief, Donald Trump threatened the safety and security of our democracy, demonstrated contempt for our Constitution, and violated his oath to protect the American people and defend our republic. The Article of Impeachment passed in a bipartisan vote by the House of Representatives last week makes the case plain: Trump “engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanors by inciting violence against the Government of the United States.” His conduct left the Congress with no choice but to take action, and I stand with the House in its decision to impeach. Now, his case goes to the United States Senate, and I believe lawmakers of both parties have a moral duty to hold Trump accountable. I believe accountability and unity go hand-in-hand. As President Biden said in his inaugural address, “We must reject a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured… Each of us has a duty and responsibility, as citizens, as Americans, and especially as leaders, leaders who have pledged to honor our Constitution and protect our nation, to defend the truth and defeat the lies."" Joining forces and working across the aisle to achieve that goal will help our nation come together again. I am convinced that our brightest days are still to come.

Named Ranking Member on Environment and Climate Change Subcommittee
Being chosen to serve as Ranking Member is a great honor and recognition of our leadership and work on energy issues over the last ten years. This subcommittee will be the tip of the spear in fighting the Biden Administration and Democrat Majority’s extreme climate change policies.
Their goal of stopping the use of fossil fuels in the power sector by 2035 is not feasible and would decimate our economy. We will work to protect jobs and America’s economic competitiveness while developing alternative solutions that focus in American ingenuity and innovation.
I look forward to continue my work with Ranking Member Cathy McMorris Rodgers and our team, as well as finding areas of agreement with my colleagues across the aisle. 
The Subcommittee’s Jurisdiction includes:
	•	Clean Air Act and air emissions;
	•	Soil, air, and water contamination, including Superfund and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act;
	•	Regulation of solid, hazardous, and nuclear wastes, including mining, nuclear, oil, gas, and coal combustion waste;
	•	Regulation of drinking water (Safe Drinking Water Act), including underground injection of fluids (e.g., deep well injection or hydrofracking);
	•	Toxic substances (Toxic Substances Control Act);
I will also serve on the Subcommittees on Energy and Oversight and Investigations subcommittees.

Rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement
Climate change is a global challenge and requires a global solution. But any agreement that gives major emitters like China a pass is simply window dressing.
I introduced a resolution that the Paris Agreement shall not take effect in the U.S. until other countries like China are held to the same standards.  To read more, click here. 

Biden Setting Expectations to Low on Vaccine Deployment
President Biden wants you to believe “100M vaccines in 100 days” is ambitious.
BUT on Wednesday, the U.S. administered 1.6M doses of the vaccine. We are already on track to deliver vaccines to millions of Americans. Biden's plan needs to be far bolder.

Peaceful Transfer of Power
Congratulations to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on their historic inauguration  I look forward to working together to find bipartisan solutions that will strengthen the future of our nation.

Week in Review
 
 
  
Pledging to Find Common Ground as President Biden & Vice President Harris Take Office
 
Over the past year, this nation has endured a pandemic, a bitter election fight, and unprecedented tests to our democracy. Like so many Americans, I’m eager to move forward, together.
Since 2015, I have had the privilege of serving Central New York in Congress under both Republican and Democratic Administrations. Under Presidents from both parties, I have worked across party lines to find common ground on key issues, but have not hesitated to actively oppose proposals which run counter to the needs and values of Central New York. I pledge to continue that work in the face of the many challenges ahead of this Congress.
As I have said with every previous Administration, regardless of party, I hope this Administration is successful in strengthening and protecting our country. As President Biden and Vice President Harris take office, I’m urging greater cooperation from both parties so we can unite to build a stronger, healthier, and more prosperous nation.
 
￼

Addressing CNY Vaccine Shortage in Discussion with Dr. Fauci
 
To beat this pandemic, our number one priority has to be getting vaccines distributed. Unfortunately, across New York State, we have seen supply significantly lag behind demand, and confusion surrounding the rollout of the vaccine. That’s why, I was glad to have a productive conversation with Dr. Fauci, highlighting the severe shortages in Central New York and stressing the importance of  increasing vaccine production and improving distribution processes.  I will continue to engage with federal, state, and local officials to address the concerns of the COVID-19 vaccine rollout and remain focused on advocating for policies and practices that will help us overcome this pandemic.



Introducing Constitutional Amendment to Reform Campaign Finance Laws
 
On the 11th anniversary of the Citizens United ruling, I introduced the Democracy for All Amendment, which would make essential reforms to our nation’s campaign finance system. The Supreme Court’s disastrous ruling in Citizens United made clear that a constitutional amendment would be required to address the outsized role of money in politics. In Congress, I’ve been a champion of these commonsense reforms and will keep working to restore democratic power to the American people.

Update on Pandemic Relief
 
I recently supported the passage of COVID-19 relief legislation that provides a second round of direct economic impact payments to working families in Central New York. The IRS has already begun distributing payments via direct deposit, paper check, and Direct Express, and anticipates finishing their work by the end of January. To check the status of your economic impact payment, click here.  
The relief legislation also reopened the Protection Program (PPP), a program which helps small businesses remain open and keep their workers on the payroll. Loans are available for first-time borrowers and certain second-time borrowers. Click here to visit my small business and non-profit resource guide for more information on the second round of PPP.

January 22, 2021
Dear friend,
This week, we carried out a democratic tradition that has defined our country for over 200 years: the peaceful transition of power. The inauguration ceremony looked different this year due to COVID-19 concerns and the threat of political violence, but the extraordinary measures taken to ensure a safe and organized event allowed the ceremony to run smoothly.
I was honored to attend and represent the 52nd district at this event and thank everyone involved who organized this ceremony, as well as the law enforcement officers who kept us safe. Click here for my statement on this historic inauguration. 
President Biden and Vice President Harris have been in office for two days and already hit the ground running for the American people. The administration signed a series of executive orders to rejoin the Paris Agreement, require non-citizens to be included in the Census, reverse restrictions on entry for passport holders from seven Muslim-majority countries, and fortify the DACA program. To address COVID-19, President Biden signed additional orders to expand testing capacity, enhance the nation's collection, production, sharing, and analysis of COVID-19 data, and direct FEMA to create federally-supported community vaccination centers, among many others.
I applaud the administration's swift action on these pressing issues, but we know that our work is far from over. Below is another update on some of the work my staff and I have done this week to serve you.
￼
Click here for more pictures of my experience at the inauguration.

Co-sponsorship of resolution to remove deadline for ratification of the ERA 
This week, a resolution I co-sponsored with Rep. Jackie Speier (CA-14) was reintroduced to facilitate the expeditious ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). By removing the arbitrary deadline for ratification, the resolution clears up legal ambiguities and reaffirms Congress’ support for the ERA and women’s equality.

March for Our Lives town hall
￼
Before leaving for Washington, D.C., I joined Rep. Sara Jacobs (CA-53) for a town hall hosted by March for Our Lives San Diego. We discussed the January 6th attack on the United States Capitol, the second impeachment of former President Trump, and actions to combat gun violence in our schools and our nation. Giving the next generation a seat at the table is critical for building a better future.

Volunteers for Vaccination Super Station
UC San Diego Health and the County of San Diego are currently welcoming the support of volunteers at the Vaccination Super Station near Petco Park. They are asking for volunteers, including licensed medical professionals who can perform vaccinations, administrative professionals, and non-medical professionals. Shift times will vary, but generally last 8 hours per shift. The minimum age to volunteer is 18.

Back the Blue
￼
￼
￼
￼
Members and staff in the U.S. Capitol showed their respect and support to the Capitol Police last week by leaving notes of appreciation in the Cannon tunnel, thanking them for protecting and serving us around the clock. 

As events unfolded at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, no lawmaker could be found calling to defund the police. We must continue to #backtheblue and support the men and women who answered the call of duty whether it be the U.S. Capitol Police or other law enforcement officials. They give of themselves each day to keep communities across our nation safe.

48 Years After Roe v. Wade

This upcoming Monday, January 25th, marks the 48th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade. On that day — in a historic moment of judicial overreach and without legislative action — nine justices struck down pro-life laws in our country. Since then, there has been decades of scientific advancements that have revealed much about the development and vitality of an unborn child. 

Every life has value. It is essential that we protect the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I continue to pray for God’s mercy on this nation as we work together to end this injustice.

Update on the Protection Program and Economic Impact Payments

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), in consultation with the U.S. Treasury Department, re-opened the Paycheck Protection Program loan portal last week. SBA is currently offering:

	•	First Draw PPP Loans for first time program participants 
	•	Second Draw PPP Loans for businesses who have previously received a PPP loan 

Additionally, over 100 million Economic Impact Payments (EIP) have been direct deposited into eligible recipients' accounts. Some may have had their payment directed to the temporary bank account established when their 2019 tax return was filed. The IRS and tax industry partners are taking immediate steps to redirect stimulus payments to the correct account for those affected. The IRS anticipates many additional taxpayers will receive payments following this effort.

You can check the status of your payment at Get My Payment. If you received a response indicating a direct deposit was to be sent to an account you do not recognize, the IRS advises continued monitoring of your bank accounts for deposits. 

Friday was the last day for EIP to be issued (via mail or electronically). You can visit www.IRS.gov and use the “Get My Payment” tool to check the status of your stimulus check. If you qualify but have not received it, you will now have to claim it on your 2020 Tax Return (Line 30 – Recovery Rebate Credit).  

The start date for filing taxes is February 12. The IRS has also announced that the IRS Free File program is now available. This program will accept completed tax returns and hold them until they can be filed electronically once the IRS begins processing returns. 

If you have questions or need assistance with the PPP or your economic impact payment, please contact my offices. Contact information is at the end of this email.

Dear Friend,

I’m writing to you today at the start of a new year, and as our nation has experienced a challenging couple of weeks. I am blessed and honored to serve as your Representative in Congress, and promise to be a champion for our community. There are many challenges in front of us, but I am confident that we can address them together. America is the greatest country on earth. I look forward to getting to work in The People’s House on behalf of California’s 48th district to serve you and your family. 

I’ll be using this newsletter as a way to keep you up to date on my work on behalf of our Orange County community, so make sure you sign up for regular updates. You can also connect with my official Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages, where I’ll be posting the latest news and updates.

Your Voice in DC 


On Wednesday, Joe Biden was inaugurated as the 46th President of the United States here in Washington, DC. I thank President Trump for his four years of service to our nation. Our new President will have enormous challenges ahead of him. These challenges can only be addressed with the support of a united Congress. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find solutions for the American people.

Following the violence at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, more than 26,000 National Guard troops were deployed to Washington, D.C. ahead of President Joe Biden’s inauguration. This week it was reported that these men and women were told to evacuate the congressional buildings and use the garages and outdoor spaces for their rest breaks, instead of inside the congressional buildings. Hours after this news broke, the troops were able to go back inside, but questions remain about why and how this decision was made. Today I sent a letter to Speaker Pelosi, the acting House Sergeant at Arms, and the Capitol Police Chief requesting answers on how this happened. Read the letter here.

1/22/21 17:02,Moving Democracy Forward | Tragic Loss Of Heroes,"￼

January 22, 2021
Dear Lindsey,
 
The inauguration of a new president is the hallmark of American democracy and I was proud to witness our nation's transition of power this week. President Biden wasted no time getting to work and neither did we—read about this past week below!
 
 A New Day 
  
￼
  
Wednesday's inaugration marked the dawn of a new day in America. I have no doubts that President Biden and Vice President Harris will be the leaders America needs to guide us through the challenges ahead, unite our country, and demonstrate all we can achieve when we work together.
 
A great deal of work lies ahead, but President Biden and Vice President Harris have shown time and time again that they do not shy away from a challenge. I look forward to working alongside them to provide relief for our struggling families, support our local communities, and strengthen our economy in the wake of COVID-19.
 
Our path out will not be an easy one, but I know that brighter days await.
 
 Creating Jobs 
 
COVID-19 has fundamentally changed our economy as we know it, leaving millions of Americans out of work and uncertain about the future. As we look to rebuild and recover, we need bold new initiatives—and that means a national mobilization that will not only create jobs when they’re needed most, but also help strengthen contact tracing efforts that are essential to the safety of our communities. 
 
I’m proud to partner with my friend Rep. Mark Takano to re-introduce our Jobs To Fight COVID-19 Act and I look forward to working alongside the new Biden Administration to make it a reality.
 
Read about our Bill here
 
 Protecting Pensions 
 
Americans should never have to live in fear that their hard-earned retirement benefits could slip away. Especially in the midst of an unprecedented economic crisis, we must take action to safeguard the essential benefits workers and their families deserve.
 
That's why I was proud to join my colleagues, Rep. Bobby Scott, Rep. Haley Stevens, and Rep. Donald Norcross, in re-introducing the Emergency Pension Plan Relief Act. This critical legislation would protect workers' pensions from the devastating effects brought on by COVID-19 and ensure their stability into the future.
 
Read about the Bill here
 
 Tragic Loss of Heroes 
 
 
I am heartbroken by this week's tragic helicopter crash that took the lives of three brave National Guardsmen and members of our community.
 
My thoughts and prayers are with the families of these heroes who dedicated their lives to serving and protecting the people of New York. Their courage and sacrifice will never be forgotten.
 

 
As we begin the 117th Congress, remember that my office is here for you. If you ever have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out. 
 
Warmest regards,
 
Joe Morelle
New York's 25th Congressional District

1/22/21 16:50,A Historic Week for Our Country,"￼ 
  

Dear Neighbors,
I had the great privilege of attending the Inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris this week. It was a historic day as the country watched the first woman and first person of Black or Indian heritage to assume the Vice Presidency. I know we are ready to come together to face the many challenges ahead of us. President Biden has already taken action to help end the coronavirus pandemic, fight climate change, and reestablish the United States as a global leader. 
Ending the COVID-19 Pandemic
As our nation mourns the loss of more than 400,000 Americans, President Biden took immediate and decisive action to correct the course of our nation’s strategy to contain and ultimately bring an end to the COVID-19 pandemic. He rejoined the World Health Organization, encouraged widespread use of masks to prevent the spread of the virus, and created a new White House COVID-19 response team. 
President Biden’s executive actions will improve equitable vaccine distribution, expand access to testing, and effectively utilize the Defense Production Act to ensure continued access to sufficient medical supplies and personal protective equipment necessary for testing and vaccination. President Biden also directed the establishment of a task force to address racial inequities, acted to protect frontline workers, bolstered assistance to states and Tribes, and created a framework to safely reopen our schools and businesses.
I applaud President Biden’s bold efforts to meet this moment and put in place a strong federal strategy for COVID-19. As Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I look forward to working together with the new Administration to provide the resources and support needed to bring an end to this terrible crisis so that the American people can finally begin to return to normal patterns of life.
Combating the Climate Crisis
President Biden also signed an Executive Order that rejoins the United States to the Paris Climate Agreement, setting us on a path to protect our country’s future and strengthen our nation’s economy. The rest of the world has already begun its transition to clean energy – we can either join in that transition or watch as our economy and workers get left behind. 
Rejoining the Paris Agreement is a loud proclamation that we refuse to let that happen on our watch, and an acknowledgement of the global cooperation it will take to fend off the worst of this rising crisis and protect our communities from catastrophe. I am relieved to again have a president who is willing to fight for Americans’ health and future, and proud that President Biden is hitting the ground running with this Executive Action. I know it marks just the beginning of what we will accomplish on climate action together.

1/22/21 16:48,Senator Murphy COVID-19 Weekly Update: January 22nd,"￼
Friend – 
Below please find the Murphy office update on COVID-19. 
As always, if you need assistance, please don’t hesitate to contact our Hartford or Washington, D.C. offices. 
Here’s what you need to know this week: 
	•	On Tuesday, Joe Biden was sworn in as the 46th president of the United States. Throughout the week, the president signed dozens of executive actions to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Senator Murphy released the following statement applauding the president’s actions.
	•	On Thursday, President Biden issued an Executive Order invoking the Defense Production Act to federalize the medical supply chain and ramp up production of the COVID-19 vaccine and PPE. Murphy has been calling on the president to federalize the medical supply chain since the beginning of the pandemic. He introduced legislation to force the president to fully invoke the Defense Production Act in March of 2020
	•	Today, Senator Murphy held a Facebook live with constituents to talk about his legislative priorities in the 117th Murphy provided a rundown of where things stand with Biden’s Cabinet nominees, COVID-relief, and impeachment.
	•	Senator Murphy joined Republican Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina to announce the introduction of their bipartisan FEED Act, legislation supported by Chef José Andrés and World Central Kitchen. The FEMA Empowering Essential Deliveries (FEED) Act allows the Federal government to pay 100 percent of the cost to states and localities so that they can partner with restaurants and nonprofits to prepare nutritious meals for vulnerable populations, such as seniors and low-income children. These partnerships will support businesses and small farmers as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.
	•	This week, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced state guidance for implementation of a requirement that state Medicaid programs suspend rather than terminate benefits for eligible incarcerated youth. Senator Murphy sponsored the original legislation requiring this change that was passed through the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act to help formerly incarcerated individuals access primary care and behavioral health services.
	•	This week, Governor Ned Lamont directed the Connecticut Department of Public Health to continue vaccinations for the 1.4 million individuals included in Phase 1b of Connecticut’s COVID-19 vaccine rollout using a tiered approach based on risk of adverse health outcomes from the virus. The State anticipates receiving about 45,000 doses of vaccine per week from the federal government.
	•	Connecticut Department of Social Services announced this week that food benefits will increase by 15% for all Connecticut households enrolled in SNAP. Approximately 110,000 enrollees will receive monthly COVID-19 emergency benefits starting on Saturday.

﻿
Standing up for Conservative Values Under the Biden Administration

On Wednesday, I sat in the crowd at the 59th Presidential Inauguration. It was an absolute honor to represent the people of the 11th District of Texas among the leaders of our Republic as we exercised the central tenant of our form of government: the peaceful transition of power. 

I also had the opportunity to meet with some of the brave National Guard service members, including many Texans, who have been working tirelessly to ensuring safety and security at our Capitol over the last two weeks.

￼

￼
￼

In his inaugural address, President Biden spoke a message of unity and working across party lines, yet his day one actions signal the exact opposite. 

Already, his administration has launched an all-out assault on American energy—the very source that heats our homes, powers our industries, and makes our military the strongest in the world. 

With the stroke of a pen, the President signed 17 executive actions instantly killing up to 14,000 Keystone XL pipeline jobs, re-shackling our country in the Paris Climate Accord, and halting the construction of the U.S.-Mexico border wall. These actions do not help American citizens—they help foreign citizens.

Notably, he also followed through on banning new leases for oil, gas, and coal production on federal lands and waters - threatening over 10% of our nation's energy production. This is gross executive overreach and exactly why I introduced the Saving America’s Energy Future Act during my first week in Congress. Our nation is struggling. We need energy and jobs, not pandering and politics. President Biden must immediately halt this unscientific and illogical assault on American energy. 

I will not be railroaded by destructive policies coming out of this administration—I will stand up for conservative values and for the people of District 11 through my voice, my vote, and legislation. In the meantime, I am calling on my Democrat counterparts to live up to their calls for unity and step away from the extreme rhetoric we have seen over the last four years to censor conservative voices and silence the 74 million people who dissent to liberalism.

Read on to see some of the work I have been doing in Congress on your behalf:

Working to Block President Biden from Rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement

Yesterday, I supported two bills and a resolution to prevent President Biden from forcing the United States to rejoin the ruinous Paris Climate Agreement. President Trump was right to remove the United States from this quasi-treaty that shackles our country with job-killing regulations that cost American taxpayers trillions of dollars and imperil our national security.

With no mechanism to hold China and India—the two largest global polluters—accountable, the Paris Climate Agreement does nothing to save or clean up the planet. 

Thanks to fracking and natural gas, the United States is already outperforming other major nations in reducing carbon emissions. Since President Trump withdrew our country from the accord in 2017, America has reached energy independence for the first time in decades while simultaneously bringing CO2 emissions to an all-time low—proving that we must let innovation and common-sense lead, not wrongheaded ideologies. 

Read more about the legislation I helped introduce to block funding for the implementation of President Biden’s executive order and prevent any further action here. 
￼

Sent a Letter Urging President Biden to Reconsider Canceling Keystone XL Pipeline

On President Biden’s first day in office, I sent him a letter urging reconsideration of his decision to halt the Keystone XL Pipeline. Coming off an unprecedented health and economic crisis, I believe canceling the Keystone XL Pipeline will have a negative effect on American families, our environment, and our relationship with Canada—our oldest and strongest ally. 

Now more than ever, we need jobs and low-cost energy; the Keystone XL Pipeline was set up to provide both. The project was estimated to bring 14,000 well-paying jobs to Americans and keep the transport of energy at a low-cost, the same energy that powers our homes, cars, schools, churches, and businesses. 

This project has undergone numerous studies and is deemed environmentally safe by experts. The U.S. has the highest environmental regulations in the world. I fear pulling the plug will open the door to hostile nations who do not operate under the same scrutinized standards as we do. This project is a partnership with Canada that has been years in the making and provides many benefits to both nations. 

Read my letter to the President below. The text of the letter is also linked here.

￼

Other Important Legislation 

I supported numerous other bills this week furthering the best interests of the 11th District and our Nation:

No Taxpayer Funding for Paris Climate Agreement Act
Sponsored by Rep. Chip Roy (TX)
This bill ensures no taxpayer funds may be used for the purpose of reentering the Paris Climate Accords.

Paris Agreement Constitutional Treaty Act
Sponsored by Rep. Lauren Boebert (CO)
This legislation requires the advice and consent of the U.S. Senate before spending any taxpayer dollars to carry out the goals and ratification of the Paris Agreement.

House Resolution Preventing the Paris Accord from Taking Effect in the United States until it is Renegotiated and Ratified by the Senate
Sponsored by Rep. David McKinley (WV)
This resolution requires that the U.S. Senate renegotiate and ratify the Paris Agreement before it takes effect in the United States. In its current state, the agreement fails to hold two of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases, 
China and India, to the same standard as the United States. This resolution specifically calls for the Senate to ensure that China and India reduce their emission standard at pace equivalent to the U.S., European Union, and other advanced nations.

House Resolution Honoring Capitol Police
Sponsored by Rep. French Hill (AK) and Ed Perlmutter (CO)
This resolution honors the bravery and sacrifice by officers of the United States Capitol Police and other law enforcement following the January 6 breach of the Capitol. The resolution salutes the devotion to duty displayed by U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian D. Sicknick, who tragically died from injuries sustained during the attack, and U.S. Capitol Police Officer Howard Liebengood who died while off-duty after the attack.

Commemorating National Sanctity of Life Day

President Trump declared January 22, the 48th Anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision, National Sanctity of Human Life Day. As a dad to three wonderful daughters, it is with great sadness that I reflect on the lives our country has lost since that fateful decision. Every unborn child should have the right to life, and I pledge to be a voice for the voiceless as I stand for life in Congress.

Read about the pro-life bills I have supported so far here.

Foxx Report
 
Leadership, in both spoken words and actions, will lead America forward. However, what Joe Biden and his new Administration are doing now is the antithesis of the leadership that defines America itself. During his inauguration speech on Wednesday, he claimed that, “We will press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility.” While he did profess to want unity and progress, the actions he took that night ran contrary to the message he shared with the American people. 
The Keystone XL Pipeline was one of the first items on the chopping block. President Biden made a pledge to bring its production to a screeching halt – immediately throwing American innovation and countless jobs under the bus. Even Prime Minister Trudeau of Canada said he was “deeply disappointed” in Biden’s decision to do so because it threatens Canada’s economy and job sectors. For someone who preached bipartisan collaboration and unity for months, this is a stark contrast. Sadly, this was not the only consequential decision Biden made that day.
Let’s pivot to America’s strong commitment to border security and immigration. On Wednesday night, it too suffered a tremendous blow. Early Wednesday, Biden signed an executive order to stop the construction of the border wall and redivert money used to build miles of wall. He even imposed a 100 day “pause” on deportations of illegal immigrants so that immigration enforcement policies would be “reviewed”. At a time when the United States faces a serious influx of illegal immigrants, why would there be a mandate to pump the brakes? Securing America requires diligence and hard work by border officials every day, and a 100 day “pause” threatens their ability to protect us. 
Look at what other Executive Orders were signed that day. Simply put, his actions have already shifted America further and further away from progress, and I refuse to be silent while America is steered to the far left. I join my Republican colleagues in opposing these radical policies, and I’ll never stop fighting against endeavors that will bring America to its knees. 
Honoring Law Enforcement
This week, I joined a bipartisan group of colleagues in signing on as cosponsors to H.Res.39, a resolution honoring the bravery and sacrifice of the U.S. Capitol Police and other law enforcement agencies. Every day, these brave men and women put their lives on the line to protect this great institution, members of Congress, and the countless staff who work in the Capitol. Their bravery and valiance are remarkable, and they truly serve as the gatekeepers to this great institution. 
However, this recognition is not solely reserved for the law enforcement officers in Washington, it’s also a recognition of countless officers in our communities, cities, and towns. They serve out of an abiding gratitude for the rule of law and protecting the people who live and work around them. I’m grateful for all members of law enforcement, and I’ll always work to defend them – not defund them.
New Scam Alert
A new scam in North Carolina is underway, and I want to make sure you have all the details. The Internal Revenue Service’s Criminal Investigation Division (IRS-CI) issued a warning to North Carolinians about scammers working to line their own pockets with Economic Impact Payments that have been recently issued. With tax filing season approaching, this threat only increases. However, with these simple tips, you can keep your personal and financial information safe:
	•	Do not respond to text messages asking you to disclose bank account information to receive an Economic Impact Payment.
	•	Make sure to avoid opening emails and clicking on links from senders you do not recognize.
	•	The IRS does not send unsolicited texts or emails nor will they call you with threats of jail, lawsuits, or other actions.
	•	The IRS will not send “representatives” to your home to ask for personal or financial information in exchange for an Economic Impact Payment.
Remember, to stay safe, you must always remain vigilant.

1/22/21 16:27,Newsletter: A New President," 
￼ 
Message from the Representative

Dear Community Members of NY-14,

It’s difficult to put into words all that we have endured over the last few weeks and, really, the last fews years. So, I will borrow from Amanda Gorman’s beautiful poem on the Capitol steps: 

“Somehow we weathered and witnessed
A nation that isn't broken
but simply unfinished
There is always light
if only we're brave enough to see it
if only we're brave enough to be it.”

On Wednesday, we finally welcomed President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to the White House.   Now, we must begin creating justice, healing our planet, and improving the material conditions for all people. The work is on all of us to organize and build a better future.

That work began on Wednesday with several executive orders from President Biden.  These orders ended the Muslim ban, revoked the Keystone XL pipeline permit, stopped border wall construction, restored protections for Dreamers, reversed the order excluding undocumented people from the Census, and more. The President will also send Congress a bill that would overhaul the path to citizenship for undocumented people in the United States - making it far more accessible.   

Additionally, the President has made clear that COVID-19 relief is a top priority, and recently released a legislative package that would provide $1,400 stimulus checks, among other measures. I believe that Democrats have a mandate to do as much as we can, for as many people as we can, as quickly as we can - and I plan to push to ensure the next COVID relief package does just that. This country elected Democrats to lead the House, the Senate and the White House. Voters endorsed our campaign promises of paid sick leave, $2k stimulus checks and retroactive unemployment. And, we have a narrow window of time in which to deliver on those promises. People are on the brink of eviction now and it would be a mistake to waste time watering down a COVID relief bill in a futile attempt to assuage Republicans when this country elected Democrats.

The other top priority on Congress’ agenda is impeachment. Last week, the House voted to impeach President Trump for the second time on the charge of “incitement of insurrection.”  The matter now goes to the Senate, which will host a trial to determine whether or not to convict the former president. Seventeen Republican Senators would need to join Senate Democrats to convict him. Only a simple majority would then be required to ban President Trump for running for future office. 

It has been a tumultuous few weeks, to say the least, and, on a personal note, I want to say how touched I was by the kind words and well wishes I’ve received from people in the district and across the country in the wake of the Capitol attacks. The January 6 insurrection is not a moment from which we can or should easily ‘move on,’ but it is a moment that can make our nation stronger if we choose to act with urgency and accountability.  There can be no unity without real accountability both for President Trump and his enablers in the House, Senate and elsewhere. In last Friday’s town hall, I talked more about what this accountability could look like. You can see below for a recap.  

As always, please do not hesitate to contact our office if we can be of any assistance. You can reach us by sending a message HERE or by calling 718-662-5970. We are also regularly sharing resources and information at our @RepAOC Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts.  

In service,
￼

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez



FAQs from January’s Town Hall
 On Friday, January 15, we held an emergency town hall meeting to discuss Congress’ response to the attack on the Capitol. You can see the full town hall, in English and in Spanish, on our YouTube page. We’ve also included some frequently asked questions and answers below.  

What is being done to hold responsible Members of the House and Senate who supported explicitly or implicitly the riot at the Capitol? 
Speaker Pelosi said that “if in fact it is found that members of Congress were accomplices to this insurrection, if they aided and abetted the crime, there may have to be actions taken beyond the Congress in terms of prosecutions.”  I fully support using the 14th Amendment to prosecute and expel Members of the House or Senate who invited insurrection against the United States, and I have co-signed Rep. Cori Bush’s resolution to do just that.

What is being done to investigate the weak response from law enforcement to the Capitol attacks? 
Both the Capitol Police Chief and the Sergeant at Arms have resigned in the wake of the attack. There is talk among leadership of both parties about forming a 9/11-style commission to investigate the failings of the Capitol Police and other law enforcement. I am also co-sponsoring Rep. Jamaal Bowman’s COUP Act to investigate ties between white supremacists and Capitol Police, and I’ve joined Rep. Rashida Tlaib’s letter calling for an inquiry into National Guard response. 

How can we communicate with the many people who believe in conspiracy theories but who weren't a part of the attack? What do we do about the persistent issue of white supremacy groups and organizations? 
It is possible to deradicalize white supremacists. One successful model is Life After Hate.  They testified to their work before Congress last year. You can see a clip of their testimony here.  Congress must fund more programs like this. 

Where can I make an appointment for the COVID-19 vaccine and access the most up to date information? 
You can visit the City’s website for the latest information on the COVID-19 vaccine. Once eligible, you will be able to make a vaccine appointment at many locations throughout the city using the NYC Vaccine Finder or by calling 1-877-VAX-4NYC. We are aware that this week many appointments had to be rescheduled due to a shortage of the vaccine. This shortfall is due to President Trump’s abhorrent mismanagement of this crisis. President Biden had pledged to dramatically increase production of the vaccine in his first 100 days in office.

WEEK IN REVIEW 
BERGMAN IN THE NEWS 
LEGISLATIVE CORNER 
DISTRICT NEWS 
COMMITTEE UPDATE 
Week in Review 
Thank you for reading this week's Bergman Brief - there are a lot of issues to cover, including updated information about the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) in the ""Legislative Corner"" and important news from around the District, so I hope you take the time to get caught up. 

After attending the Presidential Inauguration this week and voting in D.C., I'm excited to get back to the District. Since long before the election, I promised I would work with anyone, regardless of politics or party, to help ensure the people of the First District succeed - I intend to keep that promise and continue doing my part to move our Nation forward. 
I'm as energized now as I've ever been to keep fighting for our small businesses, Veterans, Great Lakes, Second Amendment rights, broadband infrastructure, and targeted COVID relief. As we continue the fight against COVID, on January 11th, the state of Michigan expanded eligibility for COVID-19 vaccines to priority group 1B – which includes those 65 and older and certain essential workers like teachers and law enforcement officers.
However, concerns continue to be raised regarding extremely limited vaccine availability, providers receiving fewer doses than promised by the state, and shipments becoming unusable due to failed temperature controls. My staff and I have been in close communication with local health departments and providers to identify and rectify these inefficiencies and bureaucratic delays in the distribution process. As the state continues its vaccine rollout, I will continue working with every level of government to remove any obstructions and ensure vaccines are distributed as effectively and efficiently as possible.
For more information on how to receive a vaccination through your local health department, visit this website.  Thanks again for taking the time to read this week's Bergman Brief. If you ever need anything, please do not hesitate to reach out to our office.   Respectfully,  Jack Bergman

(UP North Live) Rep. Jack Bergman Announces Service Academy Nominations
Rep. Jack Bergman has announced the United States Military Service Academy nominations for students in Michigan’s First Congressional District.
Each year, Members of Congress select qualified students from their respective districts to attend one of America’s prestigious Military Academies.
""I'm proud of the young men and women across Michigan's First District who I've had the privilege to nominate to our Nation's Service Academies,” Bergman said. “These young leaders have demonstrated their commitment to service, country, and education. The First District has sent distinguished nominees to the Service Academies for decades - I have full confidence that these students will carry on that tradition.""

Earlier this week, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released its FY21 work plan to reflect the appropriations provided in H.R. 133. The work plan includes an additional $46.543 million for continuing construction of a new lock at the Soo, bringing the total FY21 funding up to $169.763 million.
Rep. Bergman stated, “The FY21 Army Corps work plan is a great next step in our effort to build a new Soo Lock, rebuild critical waterway infrastructure, and protect our Great Lakes from invasive species. Just a few short years ago, many of these projects were considered pipe dreams – but through our collaborative effort, a new Soo Lock is being built, and early stages of the planning for the Brandon Road project are beginning.”
On Jan. 8, Rep. Bergman signed a bipartisan letter urging the Army Corps to prioritize Great Lakes projects.

(Mining Gazette) Bergman Shares New Update On PPP Reopening And Guidance
This past Monday, Jan. 11, the PPP reopened for small businesses and other newly eligible entities that did not receive a PPP loan during the first round of the program this summer.
Over the last week, federal agencies have published and released helpful information as it pertains to PPP.
On Monday, Rep. Bergman provided an update to small businesses that the SBA and Treasury were Re-Opening the PPP.
Read more here
Legislative Corner 
The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) is now fully open. 

All eligible small businesses and eligible entities can pursue either a first draw PPP loan or second draw PPP loan. All lenders, no matter the size, can make PPP loans to eligible applicants. 

According to the Small Business Administration (SBA), this second round of PPP lending has already produced positive results for Main Street. From Monday, January 11, 2021 to Sunday, January 17, 2021, almost 3,000 lenders made approximately 60,000 PPP loans for a total of $5 billion. 

The SBA and the Department of the Treasury also released new guidance on PPP loan forgiveness and the new simplified PPP loan forgiveness application for loans of $150,000 or less.

In addition to the PPP loan forgiveness guidance and simplified forgiveness application, the SBA and the Department of the Treasury continue to publish important information detailing how the PPP will function moving forward. 

• Guidance related to calculating maximum loan amount for first draw PPP loans. This guidance covers information for those who are self-employed with employees, self-employed without employees, partnerships, nonprofits, farmers and ranchers, etc.

• Guidance related to calculating maximum loan amount for second draw PPP loans. This guidance includes a discussion on the revenue reduction requirements and outlines loan amount calculations for eligible small businesses and eligible entities.

• Procedural Notice detailing the reapplication process for increases in PPP first draw loan amounts for certain eligible applicants under the law.

• Procedural Notice outlining the PPP loan errors process for when good faith errors were made that resulted in an incorrect PPP loan amount. • Form for covered individuals to disclose controlling interests.

• Form for covered individuals to disclose controlling interests. 

More guidance related to the other small business programs included in the December COVID Relief bill are expected in the near future.

Bergman Signs On as an Original Cosponsor of Bills Protecting Second Amendment Rights
Rep. Bergman recently joined as an original cosponsor of two different pieces of legislation to protect our Constitutionally-guaranteed right to bear arms. H.R. 38, the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, would allow law-abiding citizens that have a state-issued concealed carry permit to travel with their firearm across state lines without navigating through a patchwork of conflicting state laws. The second bill – H.R. 95, the Hearing Protection Act – would remove suppressors from restrictive regulations under the National Firearms Act and instead regulate them like traditional firearms. These bills will help protect our rights guaranteed under the Second Amendment while helping facilitate hunting, sport shooting, and personal security.
ICYMI: Rep. Bergman and Colleagues Successfully Oppose Unjust ATF Regulation
In December, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) announced a proposed guidance related to the classification of weapons with stabilizing braces. This sweeping regulation would have given the ATF broad discretion to misclassify a number of firearms and turn law-abiding gun owners into criminals without any input from Congress or the American people. In response, Congressman Bergman joined with his colleagues in sending a letter to Attorney General Barr and ATF Acting Director Lombardo opposing the proposed guidance. Shortly after this pushback, the ATF announced they would immediately withdraw the proposal.

Coronavirus Update

On Thursday, Michigan reported 2,165 new cases of COVID-19 and 148 new deaths, bringing the state’s total cases to 544,311 and deaths to 14,053. Michigan’s COVID-19 case and death rates are improving, so now is the time to double-down on following CDC guidelines as we get Americans vaccinated against the deadly virus.
Vaccines are continuing to be delivered to states and administered to Americans. On Thursday, Michigan reported 1,096,225 COVID vaccines have been distributed and, of that, 598,127 vaccines have been administered. Governor Whitmer has expanded vaccination eligibility to Michiganders 65 and older, frontline workers, and teachers and childcare providers.
Science and truth have returned to the White House! On his first days in office, President Biden has rolled up his sleeves and gotten to work to immediately address the United States’ failures in responding to the COVID-19 virus that has killed over 400,000 Americans. One of his first actions as President, Biden released a national strategy to crush COVID, including:
	1.	Ensure all Americans have access to regular, reliable, and free COVID testing
	2.	Fix personal protective equipment problems by using the Defense Production Act
	3.	Provide clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance for how communities should navigate the pandemic, including how to reopen schools
	4.	Plan for the effective, equitable distribution of treatments and vaccines
	5.	Protect older and other high-risk Americans
	6.	Rebuild systems to predict, prevent, and mitigate pandemics in the future
	7.	Ask Americans to mask up for 100 days
President Biden’s swift actions finally gives us a uniform approach to crushing this virus and sets a roadmap for building our economy back better. Inconsistent efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID across the U.S. is what has led us to this moment with over 24 million reported cases and over 411,000 deaths. Tackling a challenge like COVID requires a full-fledged national response.

 Legislative Update

 As the Biden-Harris Administration hits the ground running to improve our nation’s response to COVID and give struggling Americans a helping hand, Congressional committees are readying to do our job to pass more COVID relief and aid.
The Biden Administration has laid out a legislative framework, including, among other things:
	•	$2,000 in direct cash payments to Americans
	•	Increased support for vaccine distribution and testing
	•	Additional aid to small businesses
	•	Funding to safeguard state and local jobs, including for our police and firefighters on the frontlines
	•	Extending unemployment assistance and raising benefits to $400/week
Congress must get this legislation passed in both Chambers so President Biden can sign it into law, and we can speed aid to struggling Americans and small businesses. These are issues impacting all Americans, regardless of political affiliation, and it will take us working together to get this done.
Today, the U.S. Senate voted to confirm Gen. Lloyd Austin to serve as our nation’s first Black Secretary of Defense, after Congress voted to approve a waiver for Austin. I voted to support Austin’s waiver after speaking to a number of military and government personnel who spoke to Sec. Austin’s exceptional qualifications. My vote was based on the person, not precedent set by the previous administration.
Today, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced that she will deliver the House-passed article of impeachment against Donald Trump for inciting a violent insurrection that resulted in 5 deaths, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer. Though Trump may be out of office, it is vital he be held accountable for his unconstitutional actions and that he never be allowed to hold public office again. The U.S. Senate must vote to convict Trump for his deadly actions. 

COVID-19 Vaccine Information

 Michigan is currently prioritizing COVID-19 vaccines for our most vulnerable populations. Currently, health care worker, long term care staff and residents, frontline essential workers, child care and pre-K through high school staff, and congregate care facility staff (homeless shelters, juvenile justice, and child care) qualify to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

For more information on vaccine eligibility and appointments, please visit the Washtenaw County Health Department website.

MI-12 COVID Testing Sites
The State of Michigan has launched a statewide COVID testing site locator. This tool will help Michiganders search for cost-free testing sites near them. If you or someone you know may have been exposed to COVID, it is important you get tested.  
￼

Additional COVID testing sites are announced regularly and this list may not be exhaustive. 

ACCESS Community Health and Research Center (6450 Maple Street, Dearborn) offers free mobile COVID testing every Tuesday, from 1-5 p.m. Tests will be given on a first-come-first-serve basis, though you may pre-register by texting “UPG Cares” to 48355.

The 2|42 Community Church in Ann Arbor (648 S. Wagner Road, Ann Arbor) is offering contactless drive-thru only saliva testing. Testing is available at this site Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m., and on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3 to 7 p.m. Pre-registration is required for this testing site. Those needing to be tested should pre-register here: lynxdx.health/register
Be safe, Michigan! Wear your mask, keep your physical distance, and wash those hands!
Sincerely,

1/22/21 15:12,WEEK ONE: The Biden-Harris Administration,"￼

Dear Neighbor,
 
This week, I was proud to witness the transfer of power to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. As President Biden stated in his inaugural address, our country faces unprecedented challenges, from crushing the coronavirus and addressing climate change to reasserting American leadership on the global stage and restoring our democratic norms. I share his commitment to solving these challenges for our community. 
 
Just a few days into his term, President Biden has already taken important actions to deliver on that promise. I want to take a moment to highlight a few of them:
  
President Biden's First Week in Action


Executive actions to change the course of the pandemic and protect public health, including a “100 Days Masking Challenge,” requiring masks and physical distancing in all federal buildings, on all federal lands, and by federal employees and contractors, and re-engaging the World Health Organization. 

Actions to extend eviction and foreclosure moratoriums and the pause on student loan payments to provide economic relief and support to working families who are struggling during these crises through no fault of their own.

Actions to tackle climate change, create good union jobs, and advance environmental justice by rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement and rolling back President Trump’s environmental action in order to protect public health and the environment, and restore science.

Actions to advance racial equity and support under-served communities. The president launched a whole-of-government initiative to advance racial equity, beginning the work of embedding equity across federal policymaking and rooting out systemic racism and other barriers to opportunity from federal programs and institutions.

Actions to preserve and strengthen protections for Dreamers, reverse the Muslim Ban, and stop border wall construction. The president also revoked the Trump Administration’s orders setting out an unlawful plan to exclude noncitizens from the census and apportionment of Congressional representatives.

Actions to address the growing hunger crisis facing 29 million Americans -- and as many as 12 million children – by asking the U.S. Department of Agriculture to consider expanding and extending federal nutrition assistance programs. 

Actions to ensure equitable and effective delivery of direct payments -- by asking the U.S. Department of the Treasury to consider changing its delivery structure and focus on getting relief to the 8 million Americans who still have not received the financial assistance to which they are entitled. 

Actions to help approximately 2 million veterans maintain their financial footing by asking the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs to consider pausing federal collections on overpayments and debts. 

Actions to ensure that unemployed Americans no longer have to choose between paying their bills and keeping themselves and their families safe from COVID-19 by asking the U.S. Department of Labor to consider clarifying that workers who refuse unsafe working conditions can still receive unemployment insurance. 
 
  
 
President Biden also released his National Strategy for the COVID-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness. You can read the full plan here, but I'll quickly highlight its priorities:
  
National Strategy for the COVID-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness

 
Ensure all Americans have access to regular, reliable, and free testing.
	•	Double the number of drive-through testing sites.
	•	Invest in next-generation testing, including at home tests and instant tests, so we can scale up our testing capacity by orders of magnitude.
	•	Stand up a Pandemic Testing Board like Roosevelt’s War Production Board. It’s how we produced tanks, planes, uniforms, and supplies in record time, and it’s how we will produce and distribute tens of millions of tests.
	•	Establish a U.S. Public Health Jobs Corps to mobilize at least 100,000 Americans across the country with support from trusted local organizations in communities most at risk to perform culturally competent approaches to contact tracing and protecting at-risk populations.
Fix personal protective equipment (PPE) problems for good.
	•	Fully use the Defense Production Act to ramp up production of masks, face shields, and other PPE so that the national supply exceeds demand and our stores and stockpiles — especially in hard-hit areas that serve disproportionately vulnerable populations — are fully replenished.
	•	Build immediately toward a future PPE supply chain that is flexible, American-sourced, and American-made to ensure we are not dependent on other countries in a crisis.
Provide clear, consistent, evidence-based guidance for how communities should navigate the pandemic – and the resources for schools, small businesses, and families to make it through.
	•	Social distancing is not a light switch. It is a dial. President Biden will direct the CDC to provide specific evidence-based guidance for how to turn the dial up or down relative to the level of risk and degree of viral spread in a community, including when to open or close certain businesses, bars, restaurants, and other spaces; when to open or close schools, and what steps they need to take to make classrooms and facilities safe; appropriate restrictions on size of gatherings; and when to issue stay-at-home restrictions.
	•	Establish a renewable fund for state and local governments to help prevent budget shortfalls, which may cause states to face steep cuts to teachers and first responders.
	•	Call on Congress to pass an emergency package to ensure schools have the additional resources they need to adapt effectively to COVID-19.
	•	Provide a “restart package” that helps small businesses cover the costs of operating safely, including things like plexiglass and PPE.
Plan for the effective, equitable distribution of treatments and vaccines — because development isn’t enough if they aren’t effectively distributed.
	•	Invest $25 billion in a vaccine manufacturing and distribution plan that will guarantee it gets to every American, cost-free.
	•	Ensure that politics plays no role in determining the safety and efficacy of any vaccine. The following 3 principles will guide the Biden-Harris administration: Put scientists in charge of all decisions on safety and efficacy; publicly release clinical data for any vaccine the FDA approves; and authorize career staff to write a report for public review and permit them to appear before Congress and speak publicly uncensored.
	•	Ensure everyone — not just the wealthy and well-connected — in America receives the protection and care they deserve, and consumers are not price gouged as new drugs and therapies come to market.
Protect older Americans and others at high risk.
	•	Establish a COVID-19 Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force, as proposed by Vice President Harris, to provide recommendations and oversight on disparities in the public health and economic response. At the end of this health crisis, it will transition to a permanent Infectious Disease Racial Disparities Task Force.
	•	Create the Nationwide Pandemic Dashboard that Americans can check in real-time to help them gauge whether local transmission is actively occurring in their zip codes. This information is critical to helping all individuals, but especially older Americans and others at high risk, understand what level of precaution to take.
Rebuild and expand defenses to predict, prevent, and mitigate pandemic threats, including those coming from China.
	•	Immediately restore the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense, originally established by the Obama-Biden administration.
	•	Immediately restore our relationship with the World Health Organization, which — while not perfect — is essential to coordinating a global response during a pandemic.
	•	Re-launch and strengthen U.S. Agency for International Development’s pathogen-tracking program called PREDICT.
	•	Expand the number of CDC’s deployed disease detectives so we have eyes and ears on the ground, including rebuilding the office in Beijing.
Implement mask mandates nationwide by working with governors and mayors and by asking the American people to do what they do best: step up in a time of crisis. President Biden will continue to call on:
	•	Every American to wear a mask when they are around people outside their household.
	•	Every Governor to make that mandatory in their state.
	•	Local authorities to also make it mandatory to buttress their state orders.

1/22/21 15:02,Blaine's Bulletin: My Job Remains the Same,"￼ 
January 22, 2021
For Immediate Release | Contact: Georgeanna Sullivan (202) 225-2956 

BLAINE'S BULLETIN: MY JOB REMAINS THE SAME 
On Wednesday morning President Trump and his wife Melania walked out of the White House and boarded Marine One on the south lawn, marking the end of the 45th Presidency of the United States. While much of the media attention surrounding the events focused on President Trump’s final speech, the impending inauguration happening just down Pennsylvania Avenue, or the cost of the First Lady’s outfit, I took that time to reflect on the past four years. Since 2017, our nation’s economy achieved historic success; unemployment reached the lowest level in 50 years; we strengthened our military; improved care of our veterans; increased border security; improved trade policies; achieved historic peace agreements in the Middle East; and Operation Warp Speed was able to roll out a vaccine in record time for a virus that has taken the world by storm. These are just some of the accomplishments of this presidency that will continue to benefit this nation and our state for years to come. 
Particularly with today’s 15-minute news cycle, it can be difficult to remember what we did last month, let alone years ago. And with an incessant media focus on the negative, some people may forget just how impactful the last four years have been on our nation as a whole. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act – the largest tax overhaul in three decades – was signed into law in 2017 allowing hardworking Americans to keep more of their paycheck rather than giving it to the government. The passage of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has improved trade relations and policies for Missouri farmers, manufacturers and small businesses by increasing U.S. agriculture and food exports by at least $2 billion each year. Landmark legislation to help battle the nationwide opioid crisis was passed to help us stop the spread of fentanyl and fight the opioid abuse that continues to claim American lives. And when our country was hit by the COVID-19 crisis, the Trump Administration and Congress worked together to pass the largest, most comprehensive relief package in American history to get help for the unemployed, relief for small businesses, and medical funding to our hospitals and medical workers who have so bravely led the fight again the invisible enemy. When it was clear that more relief was necessary, we passed another package to get more relief to Americans struggling to pay the bills, further assist hurting businesses, and increased funding to our medical community to finish and distribute the vaccine to everyone who wants to receive it. The pandemic put life on hold for many Americans, but thanks to the Trump Administration’s efforts we are coming back fast.
Not every Presidency or President is perfect; they are all human after all. From his first day in office, President Trump’s detractors threw everything they possibly could at him to delegitimize his election or prevent him from success. And as we all do, the President made his own mistakes.  But at the end of the day – the end of a Presidency, no matter party allegiances or personal views, Donald Trump should be commended for his service to our nation and appreciated for the many accomplishments he achieved for Missourians and the American People. I certainly appreciate his willingness to take on the most difficult and consequential job in the world and congratulate him on a job well done. 
The end of Presidency marks the beginning of a new one. President Biden’s swearing in begins a new chapter in our history, and I truly hope in it we enjoy the many successes we did during the last. 
Despite our hopes for the future, I am admittedly skeptical of the new Administration’s priorities. After a year of campaign speeches about American workers, less than six hours after being sworn in President Biden killed thousands of jobs in the middle of the country with the stroke of a pen, ending construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. As he and his staff moved into the most secure building in the world, protected by multiple layers of fencing and security, the security of the country’s southern border was immediately weakened by the stopping of construction of the border wall. And right after announcing a mask mandate on all federal lands, the new President stood at the Lincoln Memorial (on federal land) without a mask. The “do as I say, not as I do” mentality that has poorly governed states on either coast appeared to be on full display in the nation’s capital. And the pandering to the far left demands of their party’s most radical members doesn’t exactly align with the unifying message spoken on the inaugural stage. 
Regardless of who occupies the White House, my job remains the same: representing the Third District of Missouri and fighting for our priorities. When our priorities and principles align with the new Administration’s, I’ll be happy to work with them to deliver results to Missouri. When they do not, I’ll be happy to debate our differences and find compromises if possible. And when big government policies threaten our economic freedom and ability to provide for and protect our families, I will do everything in my power to stop them. That is my job, and I’m honored to do it.

This week, I commemorated the destructive anniversary of Roe v Wade by introducing two pro-life bills and one resolution in the U.S. House of Representatives. Today marks the 48th year since the U.S. Supreme Court decided the case, which has led to more than 62 million abortions in the United States, according to estimates.I introduced the Abortion Is Not Health Care Act, the Pregnant Women Health and Safety Act, and a Resolution recognizing the importance of access to comprehensive, high-quality, life-affirming medical care for women of all ages.This week, we remember and honor all of the lives ended by the heinous practice of abortion. We reflect on these innocent human beings and their God-given potentials extinguished by cruel instruments or medication. We mourn with the families who have experienced great regret over their abortions. We pray for healing for all of the mothers who have chosen the path of abortion for their little ones. But we resolve to end the practice of abortion and to value all innocent life as sacred. Since the contemptable Roe v Wade decision, Americans have made great strides across the nation to protect the lives of the unborn. I am pleased to represent one of the most pro-life states in the union, Arizona, and to have had the privilege of fighting for life for decades. To this end, I have reintroduced three pieces of pro-life legislation to reaffirm our values and to ensure that mothers and their unborn children are protected. The next four years of the Biden administration will bring out the worst abortion policies and edicts that our nation has experienced since the Roe v Wade decision. However, the pro-life community will rise above these challenges to grow our movement and to bring about an end to abortion on-demand. I am fortunate to have an opportunity to fight for life in the U.S. Congress – the worthiest of causes one can be a part of in the course of public service. Here's some additional information about the three pieces of legislation I reintroduced:   Abortion Is Not Health Care Act - This bill ends the Internal Revenue Service’s treatment of out-of-pocket abortion costs as a medical expense. Cosponsors: Jeff Duncan (SC-03), Ralph Norman (SC-05), Matt Gaetz (FL-01), Alex Mooney (WV-02), Ted Budd (NC-13), Mike Kelly (PA-16), Bob Gibbs (OH-07), David Rouzer (NC-07), Rick Allen (GA-12), Chip Roy (TX-21), Lance Gooden (TX-03), Bob Good (VA-05), Brian Babin (TX-36), Madison Cawthorn (NC-11), Doug Lamborn (CO-06), Barry Moore (AL-02), Markwayne Mullin (OK-02), Bill Johnson (OH-06), Matt Rosendale (MT-AL), Jim Banks (IN-03), Fred Keller (PA-12), Greg Steube (FL-17), Ronny Jackson (TX-13) Pregnant Women Health and Safety Act - This bill requires abortion providers to have admitting privileges to a local hospital and to adhere to basic safety standards. Cosponsors: Jeff Duncan (SC-03), Ralph Norman (SC-05), Matt Gaetz (FL-01), Alex Mooney (WV-02), Ted Budd (NC-13), Bob Gibbs (OH-07), David Rouzer (NC-07), Lance Gooden (TX-03), Ashley Hinson (IA-01), Bob Good (VA-05), Madison Cawthorn (NC-11), Barry Moore (AL-02), Markwayne Mullin (OK-02), Bill Johnson (OH-06), Rick Allen (GA-12), Fred Keller (PA-12), Greg Steube (FL-17) Resolution recognizing the importance of access to comprehensive, high-quality, life-affirming medical care for women of all ages. - This resolution recognizes the high standards established by Pro Women’s Healthcare Centers consortium as standards worth implementing nationwide.Cosponsors: Jeff Duncan (SC-03), Ralph Norman (SC-05), Matt Gaetz (FL-01), Bob Gibbs (OH-07), David Rouzer (NC-07), Lance Gooden (TX-03), Bob Good (VA-05), Madison Cawthorn (NC-11), Barry Moore (AL-02), Bill Johnson (OH-06), Rick Allen (GA-12), Greg Steube (FL-17)

It’s Darkest Before the Dawn


As the old adage goes, “it’s always the darkest before the dawn” and it’s been very dark on the COVID-19 front recently. As we hope for light at the end of the tunnel, we can only pray that the light is not a train coming the other way. The federal effort lead by the Trump Administration known as ‘Operation Warp Speed’ yielded several highly effective COVID-19 vaccines in record time. Vaccines from multiple companies are being distributed to all 50 states and each state government has formulated its own plan on distributing these vaccines to their residents. 
In Missouri, Governor Parson and the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services are leading the effort to get the vaccine into people’s arms. Missouri has just concluded Phase 1A of its vaccine distribution effort, which focused on frontline healthcare workers and long-term care facility staff and residents. During this phase, over 200,000 Missourians received a COVID-19 vaccination.
Missouri is beginning Phase 1B of its vaccine rollout, which consists of three tiers. During the start of Phase 1B, the state is focusing on Tier 1, which includes individuals working in emergency services, in non-patient facing healthcare positions, and emergency management. Tier 2 includes individuals who are considered high-risk. This includes any individual over the age of 65, women who are pregnant, adults with cancer, and individuals with pre-existing conditions such as Sickle Cell Disease or Type 2 Diabetes. Tiers 1 and 2 are now active, which means individuals who fall within either tier now qualify for vaccination.
The third and final tier of Phase 1B will see individuals working in critical infrastructure receive this vaccine. This includes individuals working in education, telecommunications, government, information technology, transportation, and more.
Once Phase 1 concludes, Missouri will move on to a broader Phase 2. During Phase 2, individuals working in a wide array of industries including the financial services sector, manufacturing, agriculture, higher education, and more will be next to receive the vaccine. Phase 2 will also focus on communities that have been disproportionally impacted by COVID-19. 
The plan that Governor Parson and his team have created prioritizes those who are most at risk and critical infrastructure sectors that are essential to everyday life. I applaud the Governor and his team for creating a straightforward and transparent plan that will get the vaccine to those who need it most.
The Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services has been completely transparent about their efforts to distribute the vaccine. They encourage individuals who qualify in Phase 1A and Phase 1B -Tier 1 to work through their employers to access the vaccine. Individuals who qualify under Phase 1B - Tier 2 should contact their local pharmacies or health care providers for access to a vaccine.
There are several resources where you can learn more about COVID-19 vaccine distribution in your area. Information on the various phases and tiers of vaccine distribution as well as general information about the COVID-19 vaccines can be found at https://covidvaccine.mo.gov/. If you believe that you are eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine during the current phase, you can find a map of all vaccine providers in the state at https://covidvaccine.mo.gov/map/. 
It is critical that Missouri continues to move forward with its vaccination plan and that the federal government continue to provide states with the support they need to ensure that they have the resources to put their plans into action. I will continue to work with state officials and monitor the progress of Missouri’s vaccine distribution plan closely.

1/22/21 13:39,A New Day in Washington,"The Durbin Report: A message from Senator Richard J. Durbin 
￼


Fellow Illinoisan,   President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Doesn’t it feel good to say those words?   Their inauguration comes during a time of unprecedented challenge for our country—more than 400,000 Americans dead from the coronavirus; a struggling economy; a deeply divided nation; strained global relationships; racial inequality; and a climate in dire straits. As President Biden reminds us, the moment calls for sober reflection as well as national resolve.    But it is also a moment of hope.  I am optimistic, now more than ever, that we can come together and overcome our challenges and divisions.    In his first day in office, President Biden took several important steps to put the United States back on track.  He rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement, issued a plan for mask-wearing and social distancing on federal property, and recommitted the United States to the global fight against COVID-19 by re-engaging with the World Health Organization.  These are all important actions that are long overdue.   President Biden also quickly issued key Executive Orders to undo the Trump Administration’s harmful immigration policies.  The Muslim travel ban is gone, diverting funds for construction of the ineffective border wall has been halted, and DACA has been restored. The United States’ immigration policy will once again reflect our proud heritage as a nation of immigrants.   I am eternally grateful to President Biden for keeping his word and restoring DACA on day one. But we cannot stop there.  I first introduced the Dream Act 20 years ago. I'll keep fighting until it becomes law.   Now it is time to get to work to build the country back better and restore the soul of our nation.    Sincerely,   U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL)

Biden Backs Beatty Effort to Terminate Trump's Executive Order  Congresswoman Beatty led efforts in Congress to preserve  diversity and inclusion training
On the very first day of the Biden-Harris Administration, President Joe Biden signed an Executive Order – Advancing Racial Equity and Support for Underserved Communities Through the Federal Government, directing the “Federal Government to pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all, including people of color and others who have been historically underserved, marginalized, and adversely affected by persistent poverty and inequality.” The Executive Order also rescinds the previous administration’s Executive Order 13950, precluding diversity and inclusion training programs across the entire federal service. Biden’s action comes on the heels of a months-long fight by U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03), Chair of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion, to overturn Trump’s draconian move. Responding to the major announcement, Beatty said:
 “For four long years, Trump worked overtime to divide us as a nation—even going so far as to attempt to cement racism as the practice and policy of the federal government—but those days are now behind us. Like me, President Biden recognizes that diversity and inclusion foster mutual understanding and respect in the workforce, boost a company’s bottom line, make our economy strong, and build brighter futures for everyone. That is why I look forward to continuing to work with the Biden-Harris Administration, congressional leadership, and my Subcommittee colleagues to advance similar policies, practices, and collaborations that fully embrace the transformational powers of diversity and inclusion.”   Of note, Beatty introduced a bill (H.R. 8595) last Congress to invalidate Executive Order 13950 and preserve diversity and inclusion training programs at federal departments and agencies as well as in the private sector. Beatty also sent a letter to President Biden and lead transition team officials calling on swift action to rescind Executive Order 13950. In addition, she wrote a letter to the Trump Administration expressing her opposition. Further, during a Diversity and Inclusion Subcommittee hearing convened by Chair Beatty in early September, the Offices of Minority Women and Inclusion (OMWIs) directors testified that diversity and inclusion training programs at their respective financial regulatory agencies are a critical tool for promoting greater inclusivity, mutual respect, and acceptance of all employees in the federal workforce.

1/22/21 13:00,Idaho Senators Will Introduce Bill to Keep Keystone XL Pipeline Construction Moving Forward,"￼ 
Contacts: 
Marty Cozza (Risch) 
Melanie Lawhorn (Crapo)
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
January 22, 2021
Idaho Senators Will Introduce Bill to Keep Keystone XL Pipeline Construction Moving Forward
WASHINGTON – Following President Biden’s executive order blocking construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline, U.S. Senators Jim Risch and Mike Crapo (both R-Idaho) announced they will join Senator Steve Daines (R-Mont.) and several western senators in introducing legislation to authorize the continued construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. Other cosponsors of the legislation will include Senators John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), Roger Marshall (R-Kan.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), James Inhofe (R-Okla.), and John Hoeven (R-N.D.).
“This day one move to block the Keystone XL Pipeline is flat wrong,”  said Risch. “The Keystone project is the linchpin of America’s energy independence and job creation strategy. Shutting it down leaves us dependent on the likes of OPEC and Russia to help power the country and undermines the pact we made with our northern ally, Canada, which remains supportive of the project. This is compounded by the reality that stopping construction terminates thousands of jobs in the middle of a pandemic, no less.”
“The proposed Keystone XL is a critical jobs-providing project that would also safely supply much-needed tax revenue to the states along its route,”  said Crapo. “Moreover, the increase in the nation’s oil supply delivered by the Keystone pipeline will improve our nation’s energy security. This privately-funded project has already been delayed enough by continued partisan bickering in Washington, and I will continue to push for policies that bring energy costs down and further American energy independence.”
“It’s only day one, and with the stroke of a pen, Biden has already taken steps to kill American energy projects like the Keystone XL Pipeline which is critical to energy producing states like Montana,”  Daines said. “This project will create thousands of jobs, generate tax revenue for local communities, promote North American energy security and independence, and it is the safest and most environmentally friendly way to transport oil. We must do all that we can to ensure construction moves forward.”
Background: 
When conducting an environmental review of the Keystone XL Pipeline, the Obama administration’s State Department found “no significant impact to the environment.” The Keystone XL Pipeline project is expected to provide some 11,000 direct high-paying jobs and up to 60,000 indirect and direct jobs, generate tax revenue, increase renewable-energy demand, reduce emissions and strengthen North American energy independence.

1/22/21 12:35,"Baldwin Supports Executive Orders to Increase Supply of Vaccine, Medical and Testing Supplies","

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
Senator Baldwin supports President Biden's announcement of new Executive Orders utilizing the Defense Production Act (DPA) to rapidly increase the production and stockpiling of vaccine, medical and testing supplies, as well as personal protective equipment (PPE). The executive actions also dramatically boost public transparency; increase coordination with State and local entities, private industry and essential workers; and create a COVID-19 response coordinator to coordinate all elements of the COVID-19 response, including the production, procurement and distribution of critical medical supplies. 
“Since March of last year, I’ve been calling for the full power of the Defense Production Act to be unleashed so we can massively scale up production of Made in America medical supplies, PPE and testing equipment. The previous administration failed to do this, which has created supply chain issues that are having dangerous impacts on the nation’s response to COVID-19,” said Senator Baldwin. “I applaud President Biden for taking action to activate authorities under the DPA that will increase our national production of the supplies we need to get through this pandemic, and his efforts to provide the leadership and transparency that the American people deserve. Now we must keep working together to stop the spread of this deadly virus, get the vaccine equitably distributed and administered, and help those who are struggling to get by.” 
The country has continued to experience supply chain issues that are having dangerous impacts on the nation’s response to COVID-19, as well as the nation’s ability to scale up vaccine production and distribution. President Biden’s Executive Orders will take immediate action to fill supply shortfalls for vaccination supplies, testing supplies, and PPE, and to ensure that these critical supplies equitably reach American communities, especially communities of color and other underserved communities.  The President’s Executive Orders will direct relevant agencies to exercise all appropriate authorities, including the DPA, to accelerate manufacturing, delivery, and administration to meet shortfalls in equipment and supplies needed for the COVID-19 response, to include what is necessary to support a transparent and equitable national vaccination plan.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, Senator Baldwin has been calling for the full activation of the DPA to ramp up nationwide production of testing supplies, PPE and medical equipment. Senators Baldwin and Chris Murphy (D-CT) recently lead their colleagues in supporting President Biden’s use of executive action to utilize all authorities under the DPA that will help deploy a more functional response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Senator Baldwin also led the call for this action as part of her Medical Supply Transparency and Delivery Act, which calls for using the DPA to mobilize a federal response to the pandemic through an equitable and transparent process.

HOME  |   ABOUT  |   CONTACT  |   MEDIA  |   SERVICES  |   EVENTS 

Dear Lindsey,
 
I hope you are staying safe and healthy during these difficult times. I want to make sure you are aware of available coronavirus assistance for farmers and producers.
 
When congressional leaders negotiated the first COVID-19 relief package, I helped to include funding for producers who experienced losses during the pandemic. These funds were signed into law through the bipartisan CARES Act, and later included in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, CFAP 1 and CFAP 2. 
 
Now, the USDA has announced additional assistance, an expansion of eligibility for certain producers and commodities, and updated payments to accurately compensate some producers who already applied for the program.
 
Eligible farmers in NY-19 can apply for these funds now through February 26. Click here to learn more and to see if you qualify. Click here for frequently asked questions, and here to complete the application form. For one-on-one application support, call 877-508-8364 to speak directly with a USDA employee. Applicants may also contact their local Farm Service Agency (FSA) Office. A list of local FSAs can be found on USDA’s website.
 
Additionally, the most recent COVID-19 package signed into law on December 27, 2020, updated the maximum loan amount for farmers and ranchers through the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The loan calculation is updated for farmers and ranchers who operate as a sole proprietor, independent contractor, self-employed individual, who report income and expenses on a Schedule F, and were in business as of February 15, 2020. These entities may use their 2019 gross income as reported on a Schedule F. This change applies to PPP loans before, on, or after the date of enactment, except for loans that have already been forgiven.
 
Lenders may recalculate loans that have been previously approved to these entities if they would result in a larger loan. Farmers should contact their lenders to calculate or recalculate their PPP loan amount. For more information on the PPP program, please click here.
 
Family farming is a time-honored tradition in upstate and it is essential to our rural way of life. I will continue fighting to ensure our farmers get the help they need during this public health crisis.
 
 
Sincerely,
Antonio

Dear Lindsey,  This is a critical moment in our republic. Political violence and domestic terrorism have plagued our nation all summer and culminated two weeks ago at the U.S. Capitol. Clearly, too many people on both sides feel marginalized and unheard. We must address this. Failure to do so will only result in more of the same divisive behavior. Further discord and violence will do nothing to heal the deep wounds that exist within our nation.
 
I believe we can safeguard our nation and institutions by taking responsibility for what is broken and working to listen in good faith. In my most recent op-ed in the Deseret News, I wrote about unity and our path toward's ""a more perfect union"". Click here or below to read.

President Biden's Executive Orders 
 
  
After President Biden's call for unity and his promise to be a president for ALL Americans, he wasted no time to push his divisive partisan agenda through harmful executive orders.
 
Rejoining the Paris Accord, canceling the Keystone XL pipeline permit, stopping construction of the border wall, and granting citizenship to millions of illegal aliens, endangers our national security, kills American jobs, and makes us more dependent on our foreign adversaries.
 
Actions speak louder than words and President Biden's unilateral executive orders just shows his partisan intentions and further divides our nation.

1/22/21 10:15,Baldwin Supports President Biden’s Action to Protect Workers from COVID-19,"

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
Senator Baldwin applauds President Joe Biden and his administration for taking immediate action to protect U.S. workers from COVID-19. The Biden administration announced this week that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) will immediately release clear guidance for employers to help keep workers safe from COVID-19 exposure, and will enforce worker health and safety requirements, targeting the worst violators. The President also directed OSHA to evaluate whether it should establish an Emergency Temporary Standard.  
“It’s clear with President Biden’s executive action that protecting America’s workers is a top priority, and I urge the administration to move forward with an Emergency Temporary Standard. Millions of health care workers, food-service workers, grocery store workers and others have been on the frontlines of this pandemic since it began, and it’s about time that Washington steps up to put their health and safety first,” said Senator Baldwin. “When we protect our workers, we can stop the spread of COVID-19 and start building back better than before.” 
Senator Baldwin repeatedly called on President Trump’s OSHA and former Department of Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia to put in place enforceable health and safety standards to protect workers during this pandemic, but they refused to take action, even amid disturbing, widespread reports of unsafe workplaces leading to preventable illnesses and deaths.  Last year, Senator Baldwin introduced the COVID-19 Every Worker Protection Act to require OSHA to issue an Emergency Temporary Standard (ETS) that establishes a legal obligation for all workplaces to implement comprehensive infectious disease exposure control plans to keep workers safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. Senator Baldwin’s legislation was included in the HEROES Act that passed the House of Representatives in May, and in the COVID-19 response legislation that passed the House in October. President Biden’s American Rescue Plan also calls for enactment of Senator Baldwin’s legislation.

Matt's Weekly Memo
 
  
  
Dear Lindsey,
 
On Wednesday, I was honored to attend the Presidential Inaguration and witness one of the most central traditions of American democracy: the peaceful transfer of presidential power. 
  
￼
Cartwright and Republican Congressman Steve Stivers from Ohio.
  
I’m so proud that we will have someone in the White House we can claim as our own in Northeastern Pennsylvania. Joe Biden knows the way of life of people here as well as the struggles they go through. He will bring that perspective to governing and be a great partner in helping Northeastern Pennsylvania come back stronger than before this pandemic. 
 
He will help us achieve real relief for our families and businesses, and make long overdue infrastructure plans a reality. The President also knows our nation is deeply divided. During his speech he acknowledged that we would have disagreements, but he reminded us that we can't let disagreements lead to disunion. He wants to bridge our divides by working with both Democrats and Republicans to solve the challenges we face in this nation. I'm looking forward to helping advance these important efforts.
  
 
PA's National Guardsmen Answer the Call
 
  
Did you know that the National Guard has been activated more times over the past year than any other time since World War II? These activations are hard on them and their families. This afternoon, I stopped by to thank one of the groups of National Guard members from Pennsylvania who were deployed to Washington.
  
￼
  
Altogether, Pennsylvania National Guardsmen make up 10 percent of the troops in our Capital right now. I am so grateful to all of our servicemembers and law enforcement officers who protected us and the peaceful transfer of power this week.
  
 
Responding to COVID-19
 
  
Last Friday, I met with a group of local mayors to discuss what resources they need as we keep fighting this pandemic. And it is clear that aid is needed to keep frontline public workers – police, first responders, garbage collectors, teachers and others –on the payroll and keep our towns and cities running.
 
Area Mayors Discuss Pandemic Relief with Cartwright

Additionally, many of you have told me through the 2021 Priorities Survey I sent you recently that more COVID-19 relief is your number-one ask of me and this new Congress. As an incoming Appropriations Subcommittee chairman, I am committed to working with Democrats and Republicans alike to deliver this aid.
  
 
Info on COVID-19 Relief 
 
  
Although it was far from perfect, the year-end coronavirus compromise Congress enacted in December extends a number of relief lifelines, such as enhanced unemployment insurance, food assistance and small business aid. To learn more about the resources now available to you, your family or your business, visit my COVID-19 resource page.

PRESS RELEASE
For Immediate Release
January 22, 2021



ESPAILLAT, TORRES LEAD MEMBERS OF NEW YORK CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION REPRESENTING NORTHERN MANHATTAN, THE BRONX, NORTH-CENTRAL QUEENS, WESTCHESTER, AND HUDSON VALLEY URGING RESOLUTION BETWEEN UNITEDHEALTHCARE OF NEW YORK AND MONTEFIORE HEALTH SYSTEM 


NEW YORK, NY – In a letter to UnitedHealth Group and the Montefiore Health System, Representatives Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) and Ritchie Torres (NY-15), in collaboration with Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY-14), Jamaal Bowman (NY-16) and Mondaire Jones (NY-17), call for the urgent and immediate resolution of negotiations that have stalled since last month while potentially leaving over 60,000 without in-network access to their doctors and hospitals in their communities while continuing to combat COVID-19.

“During this COVID-19 pandemic, New Yorkers relied on UHC and Montefiore in tandem for their health care that they knew and relied upon. We are told the result of arrested negotiations leaves over 60,000 patients in the Bronx, Newburgh, and White Plains without in-network access to their doctors and hospitals. Many of us have heard from constituents concerned about this loss of healthcare access,” stated members in the joint letter.

As previously reported, contract negotiations between the Montefiore Health System and UnitedHealthcare have stalled for nearly a month as more than 60,000 patients could be burdened with higher fees for services no longer considered in-network and face increased out of pocket expenses as a result. This is a critical time especially for minorities communities that continue to be devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Members urge UnitedHealth Group to return to the negotiating table and work in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable outcome. 

Read the letter in its entirety below:

Montefiore Health System

Bronx, NY 10467

Dear Messrs. Wichmann and Ozuah:

We understand that UnitedHealth Group and its affiliate UnitedHealthcare of New York (“UHC”) and the Montefiore Health System (“Montefiore”) were unable to come to a resolution and agreement during negotiations, before the end 2020. During this COVID-19 pandemic, New Yorkers relied on UHC and Montefiore in tandem for their health care that they knew and relied upon. We are told the result of arrested negotiations leaves over 60,000 patients in the Bronx, Newburgh, and White Plains without in-network access to their doctors and hospitals. Many of us have heard from constituents concerned about this loss of healthcare access.

With over two weeks since the negotiation deadline having passed, we urge both UHC and Montefiore to return to the negotiating table and work in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable outcome. Until this matter is resolved, we will continue to urge all parties to work together and find a solution to this impasse that invariably impacts the health and safety of New Yorkers who will still require healthcare during this COVID-19 pandemic.

Respectfully,

# # #

ESPAILLAT Y TORRES ENCABEZAN MIEMBROS DE LA DELEGACIÓN DE CONGRESISTAS DE NUEVA YORK QUE REPRESENTAN EL NORTE DE MANHATTAN, EL BRONX, NORTH-CENTRAL QUEENS, WESTCHESTER Y HUDSON VALLEY, EN LA SOLICITUD DE UNA RESOLUCIÓN ENTRE UNITEDHEALTHCARE DE NUEVA YORK Y EL SISTEMA DE SALUD MONTEFIORE 


NEW YORK, NY – En una carta dirigida a UnitedHealth Group y al Sistema de Salud Montefiore, los congresistas Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) y Ritchie Torres (NY-15), en colaboración con los congresistas Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (NY-14), Jamaal Bowman (NY-16) y Mondaire Jones (NY-17), solicitaron una resolución urgente e inmediata de las negociaciones que se han estancado desde el mes pasado y que potencialmente dejan a más de 60,000 personas sin acceso dentro de la red a sus médicos y hospitales en sus comunidades mientras se continúa combatiendo el COVID-19.

“Durante esta pandemia de COVID-19, los neoyorquinos confiaron en UHC y Montefiore en conjunto para la atención médica que conocían y en la que confiaban. Nos han informado que, como resultado de la paralización de las negociaciones, más de 60,000 pacientes en El Bronx, Newburgh y White Plains han sido dejados sin acceso dentro de la red a sus médicos y hospitales. Muchos de nosotros hemos escuchado las preocupaciones de los constituyentes por esta pérdida de acceso a la atención médica”, declararon los miembros en la carta conjunta.

Como se informó previamente, las negociaciones del contrato entre el Sistema de Salud Montefiore y UnitedHealthcare se han estancado durante casi un mes, mientras más de 60,000 pacientes podrían tener que pagar tarifas más altas por servicios que ya no se consideran dentro de la red y, como resultado, enfrentar mayores gastos de su propio bolsillo. Este es un momento crítico, especialmente para las comunidades minoritarias que continúan siendo devastadas por la pandemia de COVID-19. Los miembros del Congreso instan a UnitedHealth Group a regresar a la mesa de negociaciones y trabajar de buena fe para alcanzar un resultado mutuamente aceptable.

Apreciados Señores Wichmann y Ozuah:

Nosotros entendemos que UnitedHealth Group y su afiliada UnitedHealthcare of New York (""UHC"") y el Sistema de Salud Montefiore (""Montefiore"") no pudieron llegar a una resolución ni a un acuerdo durante las negociaciones, antes de finales de 2020. Durante esta pandemia de COVID-19, los neoyorquinos confiaron en UHC y Montefiore en conjunto para la atención médica que conocían y en la que confiaban. Nos han informado que, como resultado de la paralización de las negociaciones, más de 60,000 pacientes en El Bronx, Newburgh y White Plains han sido dejados sin acceso dentro de la red a sus médicos y hospitales. Muchos de nosotros hemos escuchado las preocupaciones de los constituyentes por esta pérdida de acceso a la atención médica.

Habiendo pasado más de dos semanas desde la fecha límite de negociación, instamos a UHC y Montefiore a volver a la mesa de negociaciones y trabajar de buena fe para alcanzar un resultado mutuamente aceptable. Hasta que se resuelva este asunto, continuaremos instando a todas las partes a trabajar juntas y encontrar una solución a este estancamiento que invariablemente impacta la salud y seguridad de los neoyorquinos que aún necesitarán atención médica durante esta pandemia de COVID-19.

Respetuosamente,

1/21/21 20:16,"Of, By, and For The People","￼  
Dear Friend,   The shocking images of a violent mob desecrating our greatest temple of democracy, the U.S. Capitol, have reminded all of us in the starkest terms that government of the people, by the people, and for the people is not guaranteed. But our democracy is not only under assault from armed insurrection. The truth is, efforts have been underway for decades to lock in minority rule against the wishes of We the People, well before recent efforts to install the losing candidate and overturn the election.   That’s why I’m leading the charge to pass the For the People Act. This sweeping package of pro-democracy reforms is designed to make it easier for all eligible Americans to vote; end the dominance of big, dark money in politics; and ensure that public officials work to advance the interests of the American people -- not their personal bank accounts.    And this week, I am excited to share that the For the People Act will be S.1, meaning it will be the first bill introduced in the Senate in the new Congress -- a powerful symbol of how the restoration of our democracy will be a top priority for our entire caucus in the new Senate.    This bill is the key to all of our other priorities.  Lowering drug prices, racial justice, tackling climate chaos, raising the minimum wage, comprehensive immigration reform, gun safety legislation -- government only addresses the people’s priorities if our democracy is healthy and the people’s choices aren’t shut out by voter suppression and election manipulation.    Everyone -- regardless of their political affiliation -- who believes in our constitutional vision should support reforms that will make sure the American people are able to vote and that their government reflects their preferences and works for them. That’s why I’ll be doing everything I can to urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to join us in supporting this urgently needed legislation.   As Benjamin Franklin walked out of Independence Hall after the Constitutional Convention of 1787, he was asked if a republic or a monarchy had been formed by our nation’s founders. He replied, “A republic, if you can keep it.” I hope you will join me in working to ensure that we do.    All my best,  Jeff

Inaugural Commitment 
Dear Friends,
Despite all that separates us in these troubling times, we are still the UNITED States of America. Yesterday, in his inaugural address, President Joe Biden committed to restoring unity across the partisan divide and promised to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans, regardless of their political persuasions.
It will come as no surprise that I have serious disagreements with President Biden and many in the Democratic Party. I am deeply concerned about the rising tide of Socialism and other extremist beliefs on the Left. I remain steadfast in my commitment to defending individual liberty and conservative values. However, I have always tried to wage this battle in a civil and respectful manner, and I appreciated the tone of President Biden’s speech yesterday. I pray to God that he keeps his word.
Only time will tell if President Biden is genuinely committed to unity. However, a true sign of good faith would be to call for an end to Congressional Democrats’ impeachment attempt of Donald Trump – thereby saving the country from an unnecessarily divisive trial in the Senate. Speaker Pelosi, despite her claims that this impeachment was so urgent, has still not sent the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate. There is still time to avoid the bitter rancor of a second partisan impeachment.

Serving the 10th District 
While it has been quite the start to the new year, my staff and I have not lost sight of why we are here, and why you, the great people of Georgia’s 10th Congressional District, have elected me to represent you. Our first priority is always to serve the 10th District’s constituents! It is the greatest pleasure of my staff and I to assist you with everything from casework, involving agencies such as the IRS and VA, to having flags flown over the Capitol and even scheduling tours for our constituents in Washington, DC. There is no job we would rather be doing than serving you. 
￼
I am proud to report that my staff worked diligently in 2020 to bring nearly $8.5 million back to 10th District constituents in the form of casework, grants, and Service Academy scholarships. Should you or anyone you know ever need assistance with any of these three categories, please have them reach out to my district offices in Monroe at 770-207-1776 or Greensboro at 762-445-1776. With 1,249 cases brought into my office in 2020, my talented caseworkers are there every day ready to assist you as best we can!
Here are a few notes we received from constituents we worked with in 2020:
Dear Congressman Hice,  I am contacting you today to thank you and commend your staff of the successful resolution of an issue that I had with the U.S. Post Office. I first contacted your Office on Court St, back on the 1st of December, where Carolyn Dallas received my complaint. Ms. Dallas was kind, professional and very patient. I admit, at the time, I was already very “frustrated” and Ms. Dallas’ interpersonal skills were invaluable. She informed me that another member of your staff, Domenick Riviezzo, would follow up on my complaint. . . I want to thank and commend Mr. Riviezzo for his perseverance and attention to duty. I am convinced that the valuable and sentimental contents of the “Priority Mail” package would have never been recovered, if not for the efforts of Mr. Riviezzo. – Oglethorpe County resident  -
On December 1 my wife and I asked for Representative Hice's help in removing an Income Related Monthly Adjustment Amount (IRMAA) that the Social Security Administration had placed incorrectly on our 2021 Social Security income that would have resulted in a significant loss of income for 2021. Yesterday morning a representative of the Social Security Administration called and informed us that the IRMAA was being removed and that our full Social Security income would be restored. Thank you so much for your prompt attention to this matter, it is greatly appreciated.  Without your help it is likely that our appeal would never have been processed in time to prevent an income reduction on January 13 when the first payment is due as our every effort to get results from Social Security office in Augusta was frustrated. ­– Lincoln County resident  -
I have good news. After I tried to contact you Friday morning I checked my bank account to find that the VA had made a deposit of $20,004.  I then received a letter from the VA in the mail Friday afternoon stating that the accrue payment had been returned to my account. One of the reasons stated was because there was Congressional inquiry. I feel sure that your intervention on my behalf made the difference in their decision to return the accrued benefit. – Oconee County veteran 
To get started with casework, my team has streamlined the process to make it easier than ever to get the ball rolling. Under the Privacy Act of 1974, Members of Congress and our staff must obtain written authorization before we can collect information from federal agencies about a constituent’s case. We have launched an easy-to-use electronic Privacy Release form to provide you with a fast, digital method to complete this first step! To get help with a federal agency, please click here.
Under the new Biden Administration and the new 117th Congress, there may be changes to how federal agencies handle casework in the coming months, but please know that my team is here to make the transition as smooth as possible!

Small Business Assistance
As a result of the recent COVID-19 relief bill signed into law by President Trump, the deadline to apply for the Small Business Administration’s Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program has been extended through December 31, 2021. The SBA has granted an unprecedented 3.6 million new loans totaling $197 million dollars to help America’s small businesses stay afloat through these difficult times. More information and additional resources can be found by clicking here to redirected to the SBA website.

1/21/21 19:01,The Inauguration of President Joe Biden and Other Updates,"￼ 
  

Dear Neighbors,  
I hope this message finds you safe and well. As always, if you have questions or concerns, please contact my office by calling (847) 413-1959, emailing me at IL08.helpline@mail.house.gov, or sending a message through my website at https://krishnamoorthi.house.gov/contact/email. For more frequent updates, I’d encourage you to follow me on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.
The Inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris
I was honored to attend the inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris yesterday. Though it looked different this year than in the past due to the pandemic, the peaceful transfer of power is one of our most sacred American traditions, and Wednesday was a monumental moment in our country. Vice President Harris is making history as the country’s first female, first Black, and first South Asian-American to hold the office of Vice President. President Biden and Vice President Harris were sworn into office and dedicated themselves to protecting our Constitution for all Americans, and I believe they will uphold those values throughout their time in office.
As President Biden highlighted in his inaugural address, we must go forward in unity rather than division. I have high hopes for what the Biden Administration will be able to accomplish while bringing our country together as we defeat the pandemic and rebuild our economy. 
 
￼

Thanking The Servicemembers Who Kept Our Capitol Safe Through Inauguration
Following the storming of the Capitol on January 6th, thousands of National Guard troops from across the country were deployed to Washington, D.C. to ensure public safety in preparation for President Biden’s inauguration. On Tuesday, I was grateful for the opportunity to meet with members of the Illinois National Guard during their deployment around the Capitol and to express my gratitude for their service and sacrifice.
￼

My Letter to FBI Director On Why a Mandated Domestic Terrorism Report Was Never Completed
In the aftermath of the January 6th attack on the Capitol, we’ve begun to analyze what failures in our defense and national security systems made that tragedy possible. As a result, last week I sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray asking why his agency never completed a report on domestic terrorism that was mandated by the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).
This oversight by the FBI of this crucial, required report on domestic terrorism is especially troubling because it could have provided us with information to better shape our response to the threats that came to fruition earlier this month. The delay in its delivery is illustrative of gaps in our federal efforts to address the threat of domestic extremism. To begin the work of addressing these issues, I requested information from the FBI Director on why this domestic terrorism assessment was not provided on time and requested that he provide the report to Congress immediately.
My Office And I Are Here To Help
I want to thank you for continuing to stay vigilant and engaged during these difficult times and remind you to please contact my office if you have any questions or concerns by calling (847) 413-1959, emailing me at IL08.helpline@mail.house.gov, or sending a message through my website https://krishnamoorthi.house.gov/contact/email.                                                 Warm Regards,

WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho) met with members of the Idaho National Guard who were deployed to Washington, D.C. to guard the United States Capitol and aid in the peaceful transition of power.
“The peaceful transition of power is part of what makes America the greatest civilization in history.

A NEW ADMINISTRATION AND A NEW DAY
Dear friend,
Yesterday, we welcomed a new administration and light and hope for our future. As President Biden and Vice President Harris step into their new roles, I am reminded of the words of late President George H. W. Bush to incoming President Bill Clinton: Your success now is our country's success. 
At a time of great pain and loss, I am confident that this new administration will tackle these challenges with facts, experience, and integrity; build us back better than before; and renew the American dream that so many have been shut out of for decades.  
￼  
The Biden administration has already outlined a clear and comprehensive plan to address the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis. The American Rescue Plan sets forth a national vaccination program, delivers relief to families and our economy, and supports our local essential workers through policies I’ve been calling for throughout the pandemic: 
	•	To address the alarming rise in childhood poverty and support families, the Biden-Harris administration adopted a policy I’ve championed to provide families with up to $3,000 per child and $3,600 for children under 6 through an expansion of the Child Tax Credit. This expansion would also make the credit fully refundable so families who previously earned too little to receive the credit will now have access to the full benefit.  
	•	The Biden-Harris administration is also prioritizing resources for local, state, and tribal governments so they can continue responding to the public health crisis, ramp up vaccinations, and pay essential workers like first responders, teachers, and public health workers.
As the Chair of the New Democrat Coalition, I am ready to partner with this administration to move our country forward. It’s time to get to work.
As always, I am here to help you. If you need assistance at this difficult time, please do not hesitate to contact my Kirkland office at (425) 485-0085. For more updates on what I’m doing for WA-01, you can follow me on social media at the links above.
Stay safe and stay healthy,
Suzan

Dear ,
I invite you to join me and Congresswoman Deborah Ross (NC-02) for a COVID-19 Relief Virtual Town Hall, on Thursday, January 28 from 5:30-6:30 p.m.   We will discuss the provisions included in the most recent COVID-19 federal relief package passed in December, including support for small businesses, enhanced weekly federal unemployment insurance, $600 direct checks, new federal rental assistance funds, additional resources for vaccine distribution, and more. We also will discuss President Biden’s COVID-19 relief proposal: the American Rescue Plan. There will also be an opportunity for us to directly answer your questions and share available resources.
Sign up for the COVID-19 Relief Virtual Town Hall
After months of harmful delay by congressional Republicans, Congress passed a bipartisan COVID-19 relief package at the end of December.  Despite my strong preference for a more robust package, I voted for this agreement because the needs were simply too urgent and too immense to do nothing or to wait any longer.  Unfortunately, we are many months from returning to ‘normal’, and Congress must begin working with the Biden administration on additional relief packages to ensure a full recovery occurs as soon as possible. 
COVID-19 cases are increasing rapidly in North Carolina and around the country. We all must take serious precautions to slow the spread. While it is encouraging that two safe and effective vaccines have been approved, we still have a long recovery ahead of us. This virtual town hall will allow us to provide an overview of federal COVID-19 relief efforts and directly answer your questions.
Please confirm your attendance in advance by registering here. If you are unable to join the virtual event, you can watch the discussion live on my Facebook page.  
We look forward to seeing you on Thursday, January 28th.
Sincerely, 
￼
David Price

1/21/21 16:31,Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Introduces Articles of Impeachment Against President Joe Biden,"
￼
￼
￼

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
JANUARY 21, 2021

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Introduces Articles of Impeachment Against President Joe Biden

Washington D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene introduced articles of impeachment against President Joe Biden for his corrupt actions involving his quid pro quo in Ukraine and his abuse of power by allowing his son, Hunter Biden, to siphon off cash from America’s greatest enemies Russia and China. 

Congresswoman Greene released the following statement:

""President Joe Biden is unfit to hold the office of the Presidency. His pattern of abuse of power as President Obama's Vice President is lengthy and disturbing. President Biden has demonstrated that he will do whatever it takes to bail out his son, Hunter, and line his family's pockets with cash from corrupt foreign energy companies.

President Biden is even on tape admitting to a quid pro quo with the Ukrainian government threatening to withhold $1,000,000,000 in foreign aid if they did not do his bidding. President Biden residing in the White House is a threat to national security and he must be immediately impeached.""

The case against President Joe Biden is vast and detailed:

	•	Joe Biden abused the power of the Office of the Vice President, enabling bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors, by allowing his son to influence the domestic policy of a foreign nation and accept various benefits—including financial compensation—from foreign nationals in exchange for certain favors.

	•	The evidence of widespread knowledge, corruption, and collusion on behalf of the Biden family with foreign nationals is clear and compelling.  

	•	As Vice President, Joe Biden was the senior Obama Administration official overseeing anti-corruption efforts in Ukraine. Hence, any illegal activity involving corruption conducted by Hunter Biden within or in relation to Ukraine would fall under the purview of the Office of Vice President Biden and the Obama State Department’s anti-corruption efforts. In fact, many State Department officials within the Obama Administration repeatedly registered reservations about Hunter Biden’s role on the board of a corrupt company. Thus, any instances of corruption on behalf of Hunter Biden via his role as a board member of the Ukrainian-operated Burisma energy firm were intentionally not investigated or covered up. 

	•	In 2016, Ukraine’s top anti-corruption prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, had an active and ongoing investigation into Burisma and its owner, Mykola Zlochevsky. At the time, Hunter Biden continued to serve on Burisma’s board of directors. According to news reports, then Vice-President Biden “threatened to withhold $1 billion in United States loan guarantees if Ukraine’s leaders did not dismiss [Shokin].” After that, Ukraine’s Parliament fired Shokin.

	•	During his father’s vice presidency, Hunter Biden built many business relationships with foreign nationals and received millions of dollars from foreign sources, seemingly in exchange for access to his father. The financial transactions which Hunter engaged in illustrates serious counterintelligence and extortion concerns relating to Hunter Biden and his family.

	•	President Biden gravely endangered the security of the United States and its institutions of government. Through blatant nepotism, he enabled his son to influence foreign policy and financially benefit as a result of his role as Vice President. He supported his son engaging in collusion with Chinese Communist party-linked officials. He allowed his son to trade appointments with his father and other high-ranking administration officials in exchange for financial compensation. He permitted his son to take money from Russian oligarchs, including Elena Baturina, the wife of the former mayor of Moscow.

Soo Locks, First District Priorities Added to Army Corps FY21 Work Plan

Washington - Earlier this week, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released its FY21 work plan to reflect the appropriations provided in H.R. 133. The work plan includes an additional $46.543 million for continuing construction of a new lock at the Soo, bringing the total FY21 funding up to $169.763 million. This is in addition to the $63.815 million available for operations and maintenance on the St. Mary's River - including Soo Lock Asset Renewal. 
Rep. Bergman stated, ""The FY21 Army Corps work plan is a great next step in our effort to build a new Soo Lock, rebuild critical waterway infrastructure, and protect our Great Lakes from invasive species. Just a few short years ago, many of these projects were considered pipe dreams - but through our collaborative effort, a new Soo Lock is being built, and early stages of the planning for the Brandon Road project are beginning.""
On January 8th, Rep. Bergman signed a bipartisan letter urging the Army Corps to prioritize Great Lakes projects. 
With the enactment of key authorizations and funding provided by Congress at the end of 2020, the bipartisan group identified continued Soo Locks improvements, Asian Carp prevention, and implementation of both the Great Lakes Resiliency Study and the Great Lakes Fishery and Ecosystem Restoration program as top priorities. Read the full letter here.
You can find the entire FY21 Army Corps Work Plan, which includes many First District priorities here.

SURVEY: Is Killing Thousands of American Energy Jobs a Move in the Right Direction?
 
￼
  
Balderson visits with specialized pipeline program instructors at the Ohio Laborers Training Center where pipeline workers are trained for in-demand energy jobs.
  
Lindsey,
 
Within hours of taking the oath of office, President Joe Biden delivered a devastating blow to America's energy independence and to tens of thousands of energy workers, whose jobs now hang in the balance. Included in the President's stack of nominations and unilateral policy reversals were executive orders halting construction on the Keystone XL Pipeline and reentering the United States into the controversial Paris Climate Accord. The ramifications of these moves will undoubtedly impact energy investments here in Ohio and across the nation. 
  
  
 
Do you believe President Biden's executive order halting construction on the Keystone XL Pipeline is a move in the right direction or wrong direction?
 
  
 
Right direction
 
  
 
Wrong direction
 
  
 
None of the above
 
  
  
Submit survey to sign up for updates on my work in Congress.*
  
The Biden Administration's executive orders will do nothing to help diversify America's domestic energy portfolio or reduce carbon emissions. Furthermore, pipelines are known to be the safest way to transport oil and gas. Halting energy projects, like the Keystone XL Pipeline, only damages international partnerships, generates market uncertainty, creates unnecessary safety and environmental risks, and most troubling--eliminates thousands of good-paying jobs. 
 
As this new administration moves forward in its first 100 days, I am increasingly concerned with unnecessary and ineffective energy policies being the pillars of their climate solutions. I hope the Biden Administration follows through on their calls for civilty and engages with both sides of the aisle on issues, such as these, moving forward. 
 
I want to hear your thoughts. Please take a moment to complete my survey and let me know where you stand on this important issue.

Democracy Has Prevailed:  Attending the 59th Inaugural
Yesterday, we began writing a new, exciting chapter in our nation’s history—and although the 2021 Inauguration looked different because of the COVID-19 Pandemic, it wasn’t any less momentous.  
￼
Waiting for the future President Biden and Vice President Harris 
to take the inaugural platform. (January 20, 2021)
I strongly believe President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are the perfect team to lead us during these extremely trying times. Moreover, they recognize that we must stand united as Americans—not political foes—to defeat the virus, expand economic opportunity, and ensure justice for all. 
To that effect, I too promise to lead by example, working closely with the White House and congressional leadership to do my best to serve YOU: the constituents of Ohio’s Third Congressional District. That begins by providing greater support to hardworking Americans, their families and small businesses, helping homeowners and renters, making healthcare affordable, addressing the student debt crisis, strengthening our communities, cleaning the environment, and celebrating the transformational effect of diversity and inclusion.  The weeks and months ahead are critical, and I believe Congress has an obligation to act. Too many lives and livelihoods are at risk. Now is the time to move from agony to action. Now is the time to build back better for our people, our economy, and our country.

1/20/21 19:51,Celebrating This Historic Day,"￼  
Dear Friend,   In the midst of one of the darkest winters in American history, today is a historic day -- and a cause for celebration and resolve. Today, our nation begins the hard work of turning the page on a dark chapter marked by racism, division, and incivility, as we set out to write a new one of hope, freedom, and equality for all.   It won’t be easy. First and foremost, we must face and defeat a devastating pandemic that has already claimed 400,000 American lives and robbed millions of their livelihoods. But we must also reckon with deeper and more long-lasting forces that have shaped everything about our lives and our politics, up to and including the current pandemic.   For decades, powerful special interests have done everything in their power to rig our economy and our society in their favor. They’ve flooded Washington with dark money, and stoked fears and pitted groups of Americans against each other in order to protect themselves. Their project has done real, lasting damage to the fabric of our republic, and it’s on each of us to do our part to restore it.   I have every confidence that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris are well equipped to lead that charge with the skill, compassion, and determination it will require. And I am fully committed to doing all that I can to ensure that the Senate is a strong partner to their efforts -- from tackling the coronavirus pandemic and the climate crisis, to passing the For the People Act and reinvigorating our democracy, to addressing directly our national shame of racism and discrimination and ensuring that every hardworking American has a roof over their head and food on their table. Let’s get to work.   All my best,  Jeff

Dear Friend, 
 
Today we witnessed the beginning of a new era in America. As President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris took the oath of office, history was made and hope was renewed. While our country faces great challenges, today indicated the start of a new future for our government and our nation. 
 
A NEW DAY IN AMERICA 
  
￼
  
￼
  
I was honored to join the inaugural ceremony on the national mall this morning, alongside many of my congressional colleagues and witness the momentous occasion. 
 
I am eager to get to work alongside the Biden Administration to get Coloradans the support they need to survive the COVID-19 pandemic, recover from the 2020 wildfire season, protect our public lands, tackle the climate crisis and so much more. I wish President Biden and Vice President Harris the best of luck, and am honored to work with them to better the lives of the American people. 
 
A new day is here. 
  
  
SAVE THE DATE!
 
Join my office on February 17th for our annual State of the District Address. This year, we'll hold two events, both which can be joined virtually. One address targeted to Larimer County to address the damage and recovery process from the Cameron Peak Fire, and one to look district-wide at the state of the 2nd district, what we've accomplished this year and the work ahead. Visit neguse2021.com for more information and to register. 
 
RSVP TO THE STATE OF THE DISTRICT 
  
On February 18th, join us at 12:00pm MT for the Wildfire Summit. In 2020, Colorado saw some of the largest and most destructive wildfires in the state's history, with hundreds of thousands of acres scorched and almost 200 homes destroyed. Scientists forecast that these fires will only become worse as climate change causes the wildfire season to strengthen. The purpose of this Summit is to bring together stakeholders from around the state to discuss the problems associated with wildfires and to seek collaborative solutions. What did we learn in 2020 and where do we go from here?

 Thank You, California. 
￼ 
 The first time I came to work in the United States Senate was not as a United States Senator but as an intern.   A college sophomore, I believed the Senate was a place to turn activism into action. I went to work as a summer intern for my homestate Senator, California’s Alan Cranston, in the very same office I returned to more than 30 years later.   Serving as your Senator has been an honor.  The past four years have tested us as a nation. Even before I was sworn in we knew that foreign adversaries had interfered in the 2016 election. Soon thereafter, families were being separated at the border, and our work to combat climate change was being dismantled. Since then, three Supreme Court nominees have come before the Senate Judiciary committee on which I have sat. Wildfires have ravaged our state, racial injustice continues to plague our nation, and COVID-19 plagues the world.   This month, we witnessed something I thought I would never see in the United States: A mob breached the U.S. Capitol, trying to thwart the certification of the 2020 election results. The violence made clear that we have two systems of justice—one that failed to restrain the rioters on January 6 and another that released tear gas on non-violent demonstrators last summer.  These have not been easy times by any stretch.  I am proud that, through it all, my office has maintained its focus, working tirelessly for the people of California.   We have taken on critical issues facing Californians and all Americans: rising rent costs, devastating hunger, unjust cash bail, economic insecurity, maternal healthcare, among others. Senators Cory Booker, Tim Scott, and I passed anti-lynching legislation through the Senate. And just last December, with Senators Mark Warner and Cory Booker, we passed legislation that will provide much-needed capital to communities of color and low-income communities during the pandemic.  From helping seniors navigate the Medicare system to helping veterans get the benefits they are owed, from securing funding for families to rebuild after the wildfires to working to get small businesses what they need to stay afloat—my team heard you, we saw you, and we fought for you. Thank you, California, for that privilege. Know that Alex Padilla will carry on this work.   And this is not goodbye.  Today, as I resign from the Senate, I am preparing to take an oath that would have me preside over it.   As Senator-turned-Vice-President Walter Mondale once pointed out, the vice presidency is the only office in our government that “belongs to both the executive branch and the legislative branch.” A responsibility made greater with an equal number of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate.    Since our nation’s founding, only 268 tie-breaking votes have been cast by a Vice President. I intend to work tirelessly as your Vice President, including, if necessary, fulfilling this Constitutional duty. At the same time, it is my hope that rather than come to the point of a tie, the Senate will instead find common ground and do the work of the American people.   Just a year before I interned in the Senate, Martin Luther King Jr. Day was made a federal holiday. The legislation did not sail through Congress by any means. There was a heated debate and a fair amount of grandstanding. In the end, the Democratic-led House passed the bill, the Republican-controlled Senate did the same, and the Republican president signed it into law.   Now, we have the pastor from the very church Dr. King preached in—the eleventh Black Senator since Reconstruction, out of nearly 2,000 Senators total—about to be sworn in. And with him, the first Jewish Senator from the Deep South since the 19th century.    Change is possible. For that, I am grateful and ready to get to work.   Thus, as I leave the United States Senate, this is not goodbye. This is hello.

Inauguration Day
 
 
Today, I attended the inauguration ceremonies for the 46th President of the United States, Joseph R. Biden, and Vice President Kamala D. Harris. 
 
I am proud to have worked side-by-side with President Trump to enact historic tax reform, free and fair trade with Mexico and Canada, the repeal of the ObamaCare mandate and taxes, a ban on surprise medical bills, and the first reform of the IRS in two decades. His policy achievements have lifted working families across America. 
 
And now, I want to congratulate President Biden and Vice President Harris as they assume office. We must move forward together to focus on the tasks facing our nation; defeating COVID-19, rebuilding our economy and getting back to normal as quickly as possible.
 
￼
 To help families recover, we need to make sure Washington doesn’t rob more of their paychecks through tax increases - making permanent the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act will add 1.5 million more jobs and helps working families meet their monthly budgets. 
 
We should work together to make America medically independent from China in crucial medicines, medical supplies, ingredients and technology. 
 
We must work together to make health care and medicines more affordable through greater choice and more cures. And we should continue our bipartisan work to help workers and families save more for retirement, especially those with low incomes and who work for small business.

Dear Small Business Owner, 
 
I wanted to let you know that the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) is now re-opened with $280 billion in funding to provide much needed relief for small businesses. Businesses can apply for a first round of funding of up to $10 million. Those businesses with fewer than 300 employees and which experienced significant financial loss during the pandemic can also now apply for a second loan of up to $2 million.  Small Business Owners can apply for these funds through any participating lender.  
 
I also wanted to make you aware of some important updates to the PPP initiative based upon the feedback we received from past participants.  

	•	PPP borrowers can set their PPP loan’s covered period to be any length between 8 and 24 weeks to best meet their business needs;
	•	PPP loans are now tax deductible;
	•	 PPP loans will cover additional expenses, including operations expenditures, property damage costs, supplier costs, and worker protection expenditures;
	•	The Program’s eligibility is expanded to include 501(c)(6)s, housing cooperatives, destination marketing organizations, among other types of organizations;
	•	The PPP provides greater flexibility for seasonal employees;
	•	Certain existing PPP borrowers can request to modify their First Draw PPP Loan amount; and
	•	Certain existing PPP borrowers are now eligible to apply for a Second Draw PPP Loan. A borrower is generally eligible for a Second Draw PPP Loan if the borrower: Previously received a First Draw PPP Loan and will or has used the full amount only for authorized uses; Has no more than 300 employees; and Can demonstrate at least a 25% reduction in gross receipts between comparable quarters in 2019 and 2020.

Here are some links to guidance from the SBA which may be useful to you. 

	•	PPP Guidance from SBA Administrator Carranza on Accessing Capital for Minority, Underserved, Veteran, and Women-owned Business Concerns; 
	•	Interim Final Rule on Paycheck Protection Program as Amended by Economic Aid Act; and 
	•	Interim Final Rule on Second Draw PPP Loans
  
For more information on SBA’s assistance to small businesses, visit sba.gov/ppp or treasury.gov/cares.  Additionally, the Florida Community Loan Fund (FCLF) is pleased to provide access to Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans to Florida nonprofit organizations and small businesses. 

	•	Its PPP focus is on nonprofit organizations based in Florida.
	•	Small businesses can also access PPP through FCLF’s network.
	•	You do not need to be an existing FCLF borrower to apply. 
	•	There is no minimum loan size – FCLF wants all eligible PPP borrowers to have access.
 
FCLF staff is on hand and ready to answer questions about the program and coach applicants through the process. Click here to learn more. 
 
I know small businesses are the backbone of our economy, and will continue to support relief measures to help you during this difficult time. Feel free to reach out to my office at 727-232-2921 if you need additional assistance.

￼
￼
￼

Dear Hoosiers,
 
Today, President Joe Biden was inaugurated as our country’s 46th President. Often, presidents begin their time in office by outlining a “100-day-plan,” letting the American people know what the administration’s top priorities will be. This past Saturday, President Biden’s incoming administration released a memo outlining executive actions and other Biden-Harris administration policy objectives they plan to address during the first 10 days of his presidency. 
 
Below is a list of some, but not all, policy objectives President Biden intends to act on or instate in the first 10 days of his presidency. 
 
QUESTION OF THE WEEK: Which, if any, of President Biden’s first-10-day policy initiatives do you support? (select as many as apply)
 
	•	Ask the Department of Education to extend the existing pause on student loan payments and interest
	•	Re-join the Paris Climate Agreement
	•	Launch a “100 Day Masking Challenge” by issuing a mask mandate on federal property and inter-state travel
	•	Extend nationwide restrictions on evictions and foreclosures as a result of COVID-19
	•	Loosen immigration restrictions at the Southern Border
	•	Stop Border Wall construction
	•	Re-Engage with the World Health Organization (WHO) 
	•	None
	•	I don’t know
	•	Other

LOVE AND LIGHT
On January 6, Congress met to fulfill our Constitutional duty to open and count the 2020 Electoral College certificates Although we expected objections from some of my Republican colleagues, we were not prepared for the chaos that ensued. No doubt we will be asking questions and assigning blame for many years.   The question that I’m asked most often and for me the most important question is, “what’s next or where do we go from here?” I take this question with great seriousness. I want all of you to know that I’m asking myself the hard question of, “what was my role in all of this that led us to such a bad place, and what are my personal and electoral responsibilities to lead us out of our dark era?""   On Monday we celebrated the legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King. He spoke many famous words but for me, I can’t stop hearing these insightful words over and over in my mind.   ""Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.""   If we are truthful we must admit that today’s norm is to respond to darkness and hate with more darkness and hate. This will not stop the cycle, “only love can do that.”   That doesn’t mean we can’t have tough and rigorous debate. It doesn’t mean we can’t disagree. It doesn’t mean we won’t become angry or upset. But it does mean that we must guard our response. Every one of us that has responded with darkness or hate on social media, every one of us that has spread rumors, referred to those who disagree with us with darkness or hate must bear some of the responsibility for the lack of light that surrounds us as a nation. 
￼
This morning, my wife Sue and I attended the inauguration of President Joe Biden. I have many philosophical differences with the President and I will work as hard as I can to advance my political ideas over his. But I have tremendous respect for the office of the President and I would like my attendance to stand as a symbol that every morning I'm waking up and looking in the mirror as I ask myself if I'm an agent for hate and darkness or for love and light.

As a reminder, you can also keep up with what I'm doing in Congress by following my Twitter account, my Facebook page, my Instagram profile, or my website for more information.

1/20/21 11:55,Celebrating the Inauguration of President Biden and Vice President Harris,"
￼


Dear Neighbor,

Today, I am excited to be celebrating the inauguration of President Biden and Vice President Harris.
￼


Below is what I had to say:
 
“Hello friends, Lois Frankel here. 
 
Today is a day of great hope and celebration. It’s bittersweet. 
 
It’s bitter for so many folks who are mourning the loss of their parents, grandparents, or even children who lost their lives to COVID.
 
It’s bitter because we know that 25,000 troops are surrounding our Capitol just to keep federal officials safe. 
 
But there are so many things that make today so sweet. 
 
A decent, compassionate man, Joe Biden, becomes President. The first woman—a woman of color—Kamala Harris, makes history by becoming this first Vice President. 
 
In a matter of days, even hours, we’ll have a President whose priority is to crush COVID and bring back our economy. Who will resign the Paris Agreement, reauthorize DACA, stop building the wall, start funding Planned Parenthood, and so much more. 
 
There’s so much work to be done on all fronts and I’m excited to be on the team that will build back better. 
 
Everyone stay safe.""

Dear Friend,
 
Today, marks a historic moment for our country. As we inaugurate President-elect Joseph R. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, we begin the process of healing the soul of our nation. It's time we pull together the full weight of the federal government and move forward with efforts to defeat COVID-19 and reopen our economy safely.
 
Congress and the new administration will be ready on Day One to provide urgent relief to millions of families across our nation. With President-elect Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, we will get more people vaccinated, create more vaccination sites, increase vaccine supply and distribution, mobilize more frontline personnel, and enhance transparency to the American public. 
 
I am committed to ensuring that South Texas receives the necessary resources to combat the virus and I look forward to working with the Biden administration in addressing the needs of working families. It's time to welcome a new chapter in our democracy. It's time to get to work. 
 
As always, if you need assistance with a federal agency, please contact one of my offices.

Later that afternoon, I had the privilege of joining CBP Deputy Director Albert Flores as well as Sergeant Genaro Hinojosa on behalf of the Texas Department of Public Safety at the Laredo Motor Carriers Association's award ceremony to receive the Distinguished Leader of Our Community award. By working with LMCA, we have strengthened Laredo’s trucking industry as well as proactively expanded compliance with federal, state and local laws. As the representative of the busiest land port of entry, I will continue to be a strong advocate for Laredo’s trucking industry by strengthening international trade at the border and taking critical steps at expanding infrastructure in South Texas.

On Wednesday, January 13th, I wanted to take a moment in between votes to deliver pizza and thank the members of the National Guard who are protecting our nation’s Capitol. I am eternally grateful for these brave service men and women and their selfless service to our democracy.
 
The Capitol is usually filled with tourists and students, interested in learning our country’s history and seeing our government work. However, seeing hundreds of service members at the Capitol shows the severity of the crisis that was caused by Trump's dangerous rhetoric. These brave service men and women are the antithesis of the rioters who recently attacked this building.

1/20/21 10:23,"Reminder: My Thoughts on Impeachment, Vaccination for Seniors, and Financial Assistance","
 
 
 

January 17, 2021
 

Dear Neighbor, 

Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to call or write to me over the past few days to share their feelings on the sensitive topic of impeachment. I understand many of you feel passionately about this issue.  I released this statement to explain my thoughts on the subject. As I explained in my last newsletter, I was appalled by the violence at the Capitol, the senseless loss of life and destruction of public property that ensued. I am also concerned about reports of more planned attacks in Washington and around the country.  Violence is NEVER justified.  

I have not agreed with many things the President has done and said over the past few weeks. However, the Speaker's politically-motivated impeachment will continue to divide Americans. It further alienates millions of Americans who distrust our political processes, have concerns about the direction of our country and feel that their voices are being silenced. It will only fuel the anger and frustration that already exists.  We need to find common ground and focus on the real challenges that families across our nation are experiencing.  

Aside from this being a counterproductive measure as we try to unite our nation, this reckless action sets a very dangerous precedent for our country. The House voting to impeach the President without listening to eyewitness testimony or reviewing a single piece of evidence is a violation of due process and a significant, undemocratic deviation from past procedures.  Removing a duly elected President from office is a very serious proposition. I am genuinely concerned that this action will make it easier for future leaders to circumvent the will of the people and remove a future President without cause. In October of 2019, Speaker Pelosi herself issued a letter “establishing the procedures for impeachment hearings that were open to the American people, authorizing the disclosure of deposition transcripts, outlining the transfer of evidence to respective committees and setting forth due process rights for the President and his counsel.” Yet, as she rushed to make history in impeaching President Trump for a second time she failed to even give the pretense of creating an impartial process. 

The real work of Congress is not wrapped-up in the headline-dominating stories of the hour, but rather is the business of solving the every-day problems Americans are facing. The long-term success of our country is dependent on our willingness to work together as one team for the greater good. That is my focus as we move forward.  

Continue reading for an overview of important developments that have transpired over the past week. 

Vaccinating Seniors

As your federal representative, my role in the vaccination process has been to facilitate the development, approval and production of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. Based on the principle of federalism and in accordance with the law, each state was responsible for developing and implementing a vaccine distribution plan to meet the targeted needs of prioritized population groups. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) provided guidance to states about which groups it felt should be prioritized in tier one of plans (healthcare workers, those in long-term care facilities and seniors over the age of 65) however, each state had the discretion to develop its plan based on the individual needs of its citizenry. 

I know that vaccination roll-out in our state has been challenging for many, and I have worked closely with state and local officials to share the feedback I’ve received from my constituents. I will continue to do so. I can say that Florida’s distribution plan is a work in progress and that the state continues to improve and expand its efforts. As noted in this article, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department announced some recommended changes last week. As long as we ensure that seniors who have already received their first dose have no delays obtaining their second dose, I am cautiously optimistic about these announced changes. I do believe that pharmacies and community health centers can help expand the number of people who are able to get vaccinated, especially in Florida. I know demand is high among seniors and those with pre-existing health conditions, and I will keep working with state and local leaders to expedite and enhance the processes being used. 

As Florida developed its distribution plan, it prioritized seniors-both those in long-term care facilities and in the general population. To date, more than 350,000 seniors in Florida have been vaccinated. While this is a higher percentage of vaccines going to seniors than in other states, we must do more to ensure all seniors have access to a vaccine. I’m continuing to work with state and local leaders to achieve this goal. 
 

New Developments Last Week

Two local hospital chains began to vaccinate seniors who get their primary healthcare through their networks. AdventHealth started with patients who have a primary care physician with AdventHealth Medical Group and are 65 or older. Each of the eligible providers and patients in this group will receive an email from AdventHealth with information on how to register. Vaccines will be administered at three locations in Carrollwood, Clearwater and Zephyrhills, until supply runs out. Appointments are required. There is no out-of-pocket cost for receiving the vaccine. 

Baycare Medical Group (BMG) also began offering the vaccine to patients who receive their primary care through the Baycare Medical System. Due to the limited supply of vaccines, invitations to schedule vaccine appointments are being issued to patients 65 and older on a rolling basis. As capacity is available, BMG will notify patients who meet criteria on a randomized basis via email or text message. Recipients of the invitations will need to schedule an appointment to be seen at a designated location.   Again, I’m continuing to work with state and local leaders to expand opportunities for seniors to get vaccinated through pharmacies and community health centers. I am also advocating for local health departments to receive more doses of the vaccine as quickly as possible. 

The Pasco County Health Department has a new way to pre-register for #COVID19 vaccine. Register so you're ready when new appointment slots open. This is a much more efficient system with the capacity to improve vaccine distribution and alleviate significant frustration for those seeking an appointment.  Also, many people have asked about vaccine availability in East Pasco. The county has just announced a new drive-thru vaccination site at St. Leo University. The county will only be accepting registered patients with an appointment at all vaccine locations, and at this time slots are reserved for seniors over the age of 65.   

Pinellas County will also be using a new registration system for vaccine distribution and expects to receive more doses next week. Click here to learn more. 
 

Fighting for Our Heroes

The K2 Veteran featured in this heartbreaking story is absolutely right-we must hold up our end of the end of the bargain. While I remain hopeful that the draft Executive Order will still be signed, I will never stop fighting for these heroes until they receive the care and benefits they deserve.  
 

Additionally, the delays Veterans have faced in trying to obtain copies of their records are unacceptable. I’m glad to see the VA finally working on an expedited pathway that will allow Veterans to access the benefits they deserve.  
 

Providing Relief to Small Businesses

I know many local small businesses are in desperate need of relief. Last week the Small Business Administration re-opened the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to provide vital assistance to those small businesses who are struggling. Businesses who have never received a first loan may apply and small businesses who suffered significant financial loss during the pandemic may now begin applying for a second PPP loan today. Businesses apply for these largely forgivable loans directly through their lenders. Click here to learn more information about this valuable program. 
 
 

Offering Direct Relief to Americans Impacted by the Pandemic 

The Department of Economic Opportunity (DEO) has provided new federal unemployment benefits ($300.00 per week) for nearly 1 million claimants who had NOT previously exhausted their federal benefits before December 26, 2020. The Department is continuing to work through more claimants who fall into this category. 

However, the DEO is still working to process the new federal unemployment benefits for individuals who exhausted their eligible benefits under the CARES Act prior to December 26th. The Department says it is making the necessary program adjustments to its computer system and hopes to be able to provide these benefits to this group soon (no specific date has been given yet).  The Department advises that all claimants should check their CONNECT portal every 48 hours for updates.  Additionally, the Department of Economic Opportunity is continuing to process requests to backdate effective dates for the original benefits provided under the CARES Act. No anticipated completion date has been announced. 
 
 

The IRS has also issued the vast majority of second stimulus payments to eligible Americans. Many constituents have reached out with concerns that the IRS Get My Payment Tool shows their stimulus check being deposited into an account they don’t recognize. In many cases this has occurred because of a confusion with temporary accounts created by tax preparation companies. In these instances, stimulus checks are now being routed to appropriate accounts. Click here to learn more.  
 
 

Protecting Consumers

It is absolutely unacceptable that Amazon, Google, and others have forced Parler out of competition. This is the very definition of Monopoly power, and it is part of a larger problem. Social media giants and Big Tech should not have the arbitrary power to silence the voices of millions of Americans. I rarely find myself on the same side of an argument as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) but in this instance I couldn’t agree more; censorship by Big Tech is a dangerous precedent that threatens viewpoint equality on the Internet. The need to reform Section 230 has never been more clear. I call on my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee to address this important issue.
 
 

Raising Awareness

Did you know that January is National Bath Safety Month? Each year thousands of people of all ages visit the emergency room because of injuries suffered in the bathroom. Here are some important safety tips to help keep you and your loved ones safe.

 
 
 

Constituent Corner

I recently received this message from a constituent who my staff helped with an unemployment case. 

When the pandemic first hit and I had to file in April 2020, it took so long to get my unemployment. It didn't come through until your hard working crew reached out, got my information and reached out to DEO. Thank you again for those efforts as it helped me so much! I had two kids suddenly out of school and found myself laid off. It was nice that despite what the left thinks of Republicans, one was trying to help me get state benefits desperately needed for my family. Keep it up Gus! Your amazing!

This is just one example of the work we do each day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!

Sincerely,

1/20/21 10:07,Today’s Inauguration,"￼
Dear Friend,
 
Later today, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will officially be sworn in as our President and Vice President.
 
They will take their oaths of office on the same steps that were overrun just two weeks ago by insurrectionists seeking to prevent today’s ceremony from ever taking place.
 
Their inauguration is proof that our Democracy prevailed, and at 12pm, we’ll hear President Biden lay out his vision for building our nation back better over the next four years.
 
We have many challenges and an incredible amount of work ahead of us to crush COVID-19, get folks back to work in good-paying jobs, ensure access to quality, affordable health care, reduce prescription drugs prices, tackle the climate crisis, safely get our kids back into schools, and rebuild our crumbling roads, bridges, and transit systems.
 
But with President Biden and Vice President Harris leading the way, we’ll hit the ground running to accomplish all of this and more.
 
I look forward to keeping you updated regularly on the progress we make to improve your life and the lives of everyone who calls the Third District home.
 
Warm regards,
￼

Honoring the Legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
Yesterday, we honored the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. His legacy is especially inspiring now as we continue his mission for equality and to become a more perfect union.  ""The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.” – Martin Luther King Jr.

Inaugurating the 46th President of the United States 
Tomorrow, Wednesday, January 20, I will be in Washington, D.C. as Joseph Biden is inaugurated as the 46th President of the United States. Any threat or attempt of malicious protests, violence or destruction at the U.S. Capitol or at the statehouse in Topeka on Inauguration Day will not be tolerated and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. In America, elections are sacred – the foundation of democratic government. The orderly and peaceful transfer of power is an enduring symbol of a government of the people, by the people and for the people. 
  
Remembering USCP Officer Howard Liebengood 
Howard “Howie” Liebengood was a dedicated United States Capitol Police officer who came to work every day over the last 15 years to protect individuals working inside the United States Senate and the Capitol complex. Born in Manhattan, Kansas, Howie was a caring and courageous public servant who I would often speak with in the Russell Senate Office Building.  His family has suffered a devastating loss, and Robba and I are praying for them during this difficult time. We must never forget his sacrifice on January 6 and work to quickly bring to justice those responsible for the trauma he and other law enforcement officers experienced that has a direct consequence on their health and wellbeing. 
  
Update Regarding the Impeachment Trial 
On Wednesday, the United States House of Representatives voted to impeach President Trump, charging him with incitement that led to the violence at the United States Capitol on January 6. After the inauguration, the Senate is expected to consider the charges against President Trump. At the beginning of an impeachment trial, I take an oath to deliver impartial justice according to the Constitution and the law. I take this oath seriously, and as a constitutional conservative, I will fulfill my role in accordance with what the Constitution prescribes. 
  
Focused on Vaccinations in Kansas 
This week, I had the opportunity to see first-hand how the Menorah Medical Center in Overland Park set up its vaccination center to serve both patients and medical staff. I heard more from hospital personnel about how I can aid Kansas at the federal level in its vaccination rollout and make certain the process for vaccine dissemination to the general public continues in an effective manner. Currently, Kansas ranks 36th in population and ranks 36th in number of Pfizer vaccines received. Kansas also has approximately 0.874% of the U.S. population and has received 0.838% of the vaccines.  I was impressed with the Menorah clinic and its efficient COVID-19 vaccination plan and execution. As the center continues to administer COVID-19 vaccines, the team at Menorah shared how the vaccine has been administered to employees and physicians at the hospital and how they have worked closely with the Kansas State Department of Health and Environment as vaccination rollout begins to become more widely administered across the state. Thank you to Menorah Medical Center’s Senior Leadership team CEO Phil Buttell, Chief Nursing Officer Katie Bruels and Chief Operating Officer Cindy Bergmeier for your time. 
  
￼ 
  
Protecting Life Through the Value Them Both Amendment 
This week, I expressed my support for the Value Them Both Amendment. If passed by the Kansas Legislature and the voters of Kansas, the Value Them Both Amendment would reaffirm there is no right under the Kansas Constitution to an abortion and that the legislature is the proper body to regulate the laws surrounding the practice.  The Kansas Supreme Court’s April 2019 decision found that abortion is protected under the state. By passing the Value Them Both Amendment, Kansas will have the opportunity to correct the Kansas Supreme Court’s overreach. 
  
Discussing the Importance of Aviation at NOAA Aircraft Capital Operations Center 
I had the opportunity to visit the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) Aircraft Operations Center (AOC) this week to see its ongoing expansion to accommodate new aircrafts and a growing unmanned aerial systems program. As the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee which provides resources to NOAA, this oversight is important to evaluate its future requests for resources to meet agency goals. The Aircraft Operations Capital serves as the main base for NOAA’s fleet of specialized environmental data-gathering aircrafts, including the agency’s three “hurricane hunter” planes. Managed by NOAA’s Office of Marine and Aviation Operations (OMAO), the AOC has a staff of 110 civilians and officers of the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps that maintain and operate NOAA’s aircraft fleet.  This aircraft fleet is important for gathering airborne environmental data and my bill to help alleviate their pilot shortage was recently signed into law. Currently, OMAO is moving forward with establishing its first aviation accession training program at Kansas State University Polytechnic Campus in Salina as part of this legislation, a partnership that will continue to put Kansas at the forefront of aerospace research and aviation training programs.  Thank you to Rear Admiral Nancy Hann, Deputy Director of the NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps and Office of Marine and Aviation Operations, and Commander Christian Sloan, commanding officer of the NOAA Aircraft Operations Center, for their time.

Attending NASA’s SLS Proceeding with Green Run Hot Fire 
This week, I witnessed NASA conduct a hot fire test of the core stage of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket that will launch the Artemis I mission to the Moon. The test fired the rocket’s four RS-25 engines to replicate the action needed to send the rocket to space. The test was completed at Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi where I joined NASA Administrator Bridenstine and Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Wicker. While the engines did not fire for the full duration of expected time, it was a successful step toward readying the SLS rocket for the Artemis I mission, and I look forward to continuing to support the agency’s goals in my role as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science with jurisdiction over NASA. 
  
￼ 
  
Touring Joint Interagency Task Force South 
This week, I visited the Joint Interagency Task Force South to speak with leaders from the Departments of Defense, Justice and Homeland Security about ongoing operations to intercept drugs being trafficked from South America. The war on drugs continues to be a challenge for law enforcement officials across the United States. As the chief appropriator for the Department of Justice, I was pleased to learn this task force is leading the effort to stop the flow of drugs across our borders before they arrive. The men and women who support this mission intercept about 80 percent of illicit substances before they cross our borders, which helps our law enforcement officers focus on domestic operations. 
  
Congratulating Elise Peterson on Outstanding Music Education  This week, Olathe South High School’s Elise Peterson received the Kansas Music Educators Association (KMEA) Teacher of the Year Award, pictured below with KMEA President Gae Phillips. I would like to congratulate and thank her for her dedication to her students and music education throughout her career in Kansas schools. Teachers change the world every day—one student at a time.  Ms. Peterson has taught in multiple schools across the state throughout more than 25 years in music education, including Hays High School. She is a gifted teacher, and this award is well deserved.

Remembering Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 
This year, Dr. Martin Luther King’s life and legacy are especially poignant and inspiring. Through trial and tribulation, his words and deeds remind us of our duty to more perfectly unify, to more perfectly realize his beautiful Dream. Over the last year, Americans of all colors and creeds have struggled to reclaim control over their lives and remain part of intimate communities. Together, each of us must do our part to heal our nation’s wounds, repair trust and rebuild our institutions, and heed Dr. King’s call to serve as “custodians of hope”.  Click here to read my full statement.  
Community Hospital in Munster Administering COVID-19 Vaccines 
On Wednesday, I had the opportunity to visit the Community Hospital in Munster to tour the COVID-19 vaccine clinic and meet with the health care professionals working hard to vaccinate Hoosiers in their area. To date, they have administered more than 10,000 vaccines to eligible individuals.   Right now, health care workers, first responders, and Hoosiers over age 70 are able to register for the vaccine. I encourage all Hoosiers who are able to get the vaccine to do so. Learn more about the vaccine and how to make an appointment if you are in one of the currently eligible categories: https://www.coronavirus.in.gov/vaccine/.

Illegal PPP Loans to Planned Parenthood
Last week, I joined 29 other senators on a letter urging U.S. Small Business Administrator Jovita Carranza to prevent Planned Parenthood affiliates from receiving illegal loans under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), as they did last year. Planned Parenthood affiliates are well aware that they are ineligible to receive PPP loans. Their attempts to apply for PPP loans were naked attempts to defraud the United States government.

Connecting with the Business Community in Elkhart and Northwest Indiana 
I joined the Elkhart Chamber of Commerce and the Northwest Indiana Forum last week to discuss the recently passed coronavirus recovery package. This package has critical funding that will help many Hoosier small businesses stay afloat during this time of uncertainty. I am proud that we were finally able to get this necessary relief out to Hoosier businesses. To learn more about the Paycheck Protection Program Second Draw loans, click here.

Condemning the Houthi Designation in Yemen
Are we living up to our principles by helping to ease the suffering of the innocent in Yemen? And are we helping to advance our national security by taking steps to end, rather than exacerbate, the conflict?  Last week’s decision by the State Department to designate the entire Houthi movement in Yemen as a Foreign Terrorist Organization accomplishes neither.  I believe that this designation will further destabilize a war torn country, which is already the home of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, cut off our ability to continue negotiations toward peace, and will force the many NGOs in Yemen to stop providing lifesaving assistance in the country.  This designation comes at the worst possible time as it will prevent the critical delivery of food, medical supplies, and other items necessary to combat both COVID-19 and famine. Yemen remains the world’s worst humanitarian disaster, one that has been exacerbated by ill-advised policies by senior U.S. government officials in recent years. Creating new, additional obstacles to the delivery of food and medical aid — during a global pandemic — is not in the best interest of the United States, our regional allies and partners, or the people of Yemen.   I look forward to working with the incoming Administration to overturn this misguided decision.   Click here to read my full statement.

Hi there, 
 As I write this, I’m preparing to return to Washington DC for the inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris to bear witness to our democratic republic’s centuries-old tradition of the peaceful transition of power.  Make no mistake that despite the violent attack on the Capitol, invited by a self-interested outgoing president, and his complicit political allies, the actual transfer of power will be based upon the radically peaceful act of millions of Americans voting to end the chaos and division of the past four years, and choosing a more hopeful future.  January 6th was one of the darkest days in our nation’s history, the realization of our founders’ darkest fears, in which a sitting president invited a violent attack against our own government. There must be accountability for those who participated in any way in the attempt to block or overthrow the counting of the electoral college votes by force. While we hear the impeached president’s supporters trying to deflect attention from his misconduct, and in many cases their own, with calls for unity, we must reject their suggestion that unity requires giving a free pass to those who have caused so much division and spread so many lies about our electoral system, that Americans were persuaded to launch a violent attack against their countrymen and women.  President Trump’s role in inciting the attack on the electoral college vote count, and his failure for hours to call off his supporters or defend the Capitol and the Americans inside, even as five died, made clear that he continues to present a clear and present danger to our country.  What we need to do now is use the tools of government, including impeachment, to unify behind holding accountable both the outgoing President and those who participated in the attack that has caused the deaths of at least six, and injury to scores more.  Here are some of the ways we fought for accountability last week:  Fought against baseless challenges to our democratic elections on the House floor The violent attack on the Capital was only part of the outgoing President‘s effort to overturn the election. The invasion occurred in the midst of the ceremony to certify the electoral college votes, during which Trump’s allies made meritless objections to the electoral votes cast by Pennsylvania and other states. Once the Capitol was cleared of rioters, my colleagues and I returned to the House Chamber after midnight to defend Pennsylvania’s votes.  Listen here: https://twitter.com/repmgs/status/1347081073252065280?s=21  Led the debate on the House floor calling on Vice President Mike Pence to convene and mobilize the principal officers to activate section 4 of the 25th Amendment If a President can refuse to acknowledge the will of American voters, then incite a coup to stay in power without punishment, then our democracy is lost. That’s why I called for the 25th Amendment to be invoked.  Listen here: https://twitter.com/repmgs/status/1349148815882915843?s=21 Rachel Maddow MSNBC: https://twitter.com/maddowblog/status/1349196185727332355?s=21 Washington Post: https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/lawmakers-speak-on-house-floor-for-vote-on-use-of-25th-amendment/2021/01/12/d0beb997-214c-4ead-b461-4263912cc3ef_video.html  Called for impeachment on the House floor It does not matter if a president incites a riot against Congress on their first day or their last. These calls for unity mean nothing without accountability. This president is a clear and present danger to our country. He must be impeached and removed from office.  Listen here: https://twitter.com/repmgs/status/1349449408618835968?s=21  Voted to impeach Donald John Trump, President of the United States, for high crimes and misdemeanors, again. Our Constitution, the future of our republic, and the American people cannot wait. I urge a swift conviction from our colleagues in the Senate. Having a President who has incited and invited a riot is a national security threat every hour that he’s in office.  Appeared on MSNBC to discuss the attack on the Capitol and the ongoing threat to our country The threat that manifested in the Capitol on January 6, 2021 is ongoing. The emergency is still with us. Reports suggest that the President’s supporters are threatening additional violence in Washington, D.C., and in state capitals across the nation. We will not stop investigating the harrowing events that took place on January 6th until those responsible are held accountable.  Watch my interview here: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=w48Cgz_D_Pw  Honored the life & legacy of Dr. King through service Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day is a fervent reminder that we must honor his legacy through persistent action to build a more equitable, inclusive, and just world for this generation and the next. The Philadelphia region is home to the largest organized day of service in his honor. I was proud to support so many service projects organized in our community to bring attention to our continued need for action on environmental justice, hunger, and the fight for economic security!    I continue to meet with our local public health and community leaders each week as we work together to map our path out of this pandemic and towards recovery. Thank you for everything you’re doing to keep your friends, family, and neighbors safe. Keep social distancing. Keep wearing your mask, And wash your hands frequently. We know that these are challenging times, but we can support each other to come through stronger.  Our office is here to help as we navigate this crisis together. You can reach us by phone at 610- 626–2020 or by sending me a message through our website at scanlon.house.gov/contact.  Sincerely,  Mary Gay

1/19/21 19:19,A message from my office on the events of the last several weeks,"
￼ 
Lindsey, 
I hope you and your loved ones are staying safe and well.
After the events of the last several weeks, I wanted to take a moment and write to you with an update on Congress. We live in unprecedented times, but our Nevada values continue to guide me -- and I am grateful for the calls, emails, and letters that my office has recently received.
On Wednesday, January 6, our federal government faced a violent insurrection. Domestic terrorists -- who had been incited and encouraged by leaders at the highest levels -- breached the Capitol building for the first time since the War of 1812.
Tragically, six people died needless deaths as a result of the attack, and our country was left deeply shaken. This wasn’t just a breach of a building. It was a breach of our democracy.
On the morning before the insurrection, Donald Trump met with a crowd gathered near the White House. As Congress met to count the electoral votes from every state, Mr. Trump repeated the false claim that he won the 2020 election. He urged the crowd to march down to the Capitol and “fight like hell” against the legitimate results of the 2020 election.
There are many questions remaining from the events of January 6. But President Trump’s role in inciting the violence is not in dispute.
To get our democracy on the path to recovery, I co-sponsored and voted for the Article of Impeachment that passed the House last week. During the debate over impeachment, I had the solemn honor to speak on the House floor (video here) in support of the proceedings.
In the face of the serious challenges facing our country, my resolve has never been stronger.
Tomorrow, President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris will be sworn in, and the path to healing our country will begin. It has been my honor to serve as liaison to the incoming administration as Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus First 100 Days Task Force, and I look forward to continuing to work closely with them as the new term begins.
As the 117th Congress begins, my priorities remain the same: crush the coronavirus, get our economy back on track, and restore faith in our democratic institutions. 
I hope that you reach out to my office to share your thoughts, opinions, concerns, or questions with my staff in our District Office at (702) 963-9360 or my Washington D.C. office at (202) 225-9894. Also, stay in touch with me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
Thank you,
￼

BROADBAND 
Take a Speed Test Here. 
The sad fact is that many places in West Virginia simply do not have access to reliable broadband and the lack of access affects West Virginians every day. Back in 2015, the FCC released a coverage map that stated 99.9% of Americans had wireless coverage. I knew then what I know now: That is just plain wrong. 
HOW MAY WE HELP YOU? 
To request assistance from my case team, click here.  As your U.S. Senator, I am proud to be your voice with government agencies during your time of need. My goal is for me and my staff to provide the best possible customer service for every West Virginian who contacts me needing assistance. While I have no direct jurisdiction in legal or administrative matters of any federal, state, or local agency, I welcome the opportunity to assist you in any way possible and to assure that full consideration is given to your case. See one of our success stories below: 
  
Mr. Arnold Meadows, of Beaver, is an Air Force Veteran who served in both the Korean War and Vietnam War. He and his wife, Rosa, contacted the Senator for assistance with his pending appeal for service-connected benefits. As the result of Caseworker Kim Berry’s inquiry, Arnold’s appeal was advanced and the BVA granted his service-connected benefits as well as additional home assistance.

JANUARY 19, 2021: MANCHIN STATEMENT ON THE DEATH OF DENNIS DAVIS   Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) today released the following statement on the death of Dennis Davis, Cabinet Secretary for the West Virginia Department of Veterans Assistance.   ""Gayle and I are deeply saddened to hear of the loss of our dear friend, Dennis Davis, Cabinet Secretary for the West Virginia Department of Veterans Assistance. We extend our deepest condolences to his loving wife Margaret and their five children. As a U.S. Army Veteran and a lifelong resident of Institute, Dennis truly exemplified what it means to be a proud West Virginian and American. Dennis came from a family of Veterans and used his career as Cabinet Secretary to serve his fellow Veterans across the Mountain State. He worked closely with my team and the entire West Virginia delegation over the years, always putting service above self and our Veterans best interest above politics. He was a joy to work with and to know as a friend. I am so deeply proud of what West Virginians like Dennis have achieved and what they will continue to accomplish for the cause of freedom. Dennis is part of an incredible legacy of excellence, bravely serving our nation and paying it forward to his fellow Veterans. His service and sacrifice will never be forgotten."" 
JANUARY 17, 2021: MANCHIN STATEMENT ON CELEBRATING MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. DAY  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) released the following statement in advance of Martin Luther King Jr. Day tomorrow.  ""Today we celebrate and honor the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., one of our nation’s most inspiring and important figures in American history. Dr. King led a revolutionary movement for civil rights and changed our society for the better. His leadership provided us a vision for what America could be. This past year has been difficult for many Americans, especially our communities of color who are disproportionately affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. My grandparents taught me that if you can count your blessings you can share your blessings and Dr. King taught us that the values of love, unity and forgiveness are some of the most important values in our society. Let us all remember Dr. King’s memory by reaching out to our fellow West Virginians to create unity and share our blessings during these difficult times.”

WORKING FOR YOU
JANUARY 13, 2021: MANCHIN, CAPITO ANNOUNCE $339 MILLION FOR COVID-19 RELIEF TO WEST VIRGINIA SCHOOLS  Charleston, WV - U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $339,000,000 from the U.S. Department of Education as part of the most recent COVID-19 relief package to help West Virginia schools respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. This funding can be used for testing, to address learning loss, and to assist schools in ways like improving air quality in buildings as schools prepare for eventual reopening. This funding was made available through the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER), and builds on a previously announced award from the CARES Act at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  ""The COVID-19 pandemic hit our students, teachers, and faculty hard, forcing them to quickly adjust to new ways of learning and teaching. During the negotiations for the emergency COVID-19 relief package passed at the end of last year, I advocated for this funding to support our schools and students as they navigate these difficult times. I’m glad West Virginia has received this funding to help with testing and other priorities and will continue to fight for West Virginia priorities in any future relief legislation,"" said Senator Manchin.   
JANUARY 13, 2021: MANCHIN, CAPITO ANNOUNCE FUNDING TO EXPAND COVID-19 TESTING, VACCINE DISTRIBUTION IN WEST VIRGINIA  Charleston, WV – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $119,346,660 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) through the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act. Of the $119,346,660 appropriated for West Virginia, $103,153,083 is allocated for expanded COVID-19 testing and contact tracing, while $16,193,577 will be used for assistance in distributing the COVID-19 vaccine.   ""As cases continue to rise in West Virginia and across the nation, we must expand COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, and vaccinations so we can defeat this terrible pandemic,"" Senator Manchin said. ""This funding will help West Virginia ensure vaccines are administered to every West Virginian who wants one as they become available and will support the testing and contact tracing programs across the state that help slow the spread of the virus. We must keep working together to beat the COVID-19 virus, and I will continue to fight for West Virginia to receive funding that helps our neighbors, family and friends stay as safe as possible during these difficult times.”

￼

￼
￼
Members and staff in the U.S. Capitol showed their respect and support to the Capitol Police last week by leaving notes of appreciation in the Cannon tunnel, thanking them for protecting and serving us around the clock. 

As events unfolded at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, no lawmaker could be found calling to defund the police. We must continue to #backtheblue and support the men and women who answered the call of duty whether it be the U.S. Capitol Police or other law enforcement officials. They give of themselves each day to keep communities across our nation safe.

48 Years After Roe v. Wade

This upcoming Monday, January 25th, marks the 48th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision, Roe v. Wade. On that day — in a historic moment of judicial overreach and without legislative action — nine justices struck down pro-life laws in our country. Since then, there has been decades of scientific advancements that have revealed much about the development and vitality of an unborn child. 

Every life has value. It is essential that we protect the right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. I continue to pray for God’s mercy on this nation as we work together to end this injustice.

Update on the Protection Program and Economic Impact Payments

The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), in consultation with the U.S. Treasury Department, re-opened the Paycheck Protection Program loan portal last week. SBA is currently offering:

	•	First Draw PPP Loans for first time program participants 
	•	Second Draw PPP Loans for businesses who have previously received a PPP loan 

Additionally, over 100 million Economic Impact Payments (EIP) have been direct deposited into eligible recipients' accounts. Some may have had their payment directed to the temporary bank account established when their 2019 tax return was filed. The IRS and tax industry partners are taking immediate steps to redirect stimulus payments to the correct account for those affected. The IRS anticipates many additional taxpayers will receive payments following this effort.

You can check the status of your payment at Get My Payment. If you received a response indicating a direct deposit was to be sent to an account you do not recognize, the IRS advises continued monitoring of your bank accounts for deposits. 

Friday was the last day for EIP to be issued (via mail or electronically). You can visit www.IRS.gov and use the “Get My Payment” tool to check the status of your stimulus check. If you qualify but have not received it, you will now have to claim it on your 2020 Tax Return (Line 30 – Recovery Rebate Credit).  

The start date for filing taxes is February 12. The IRS has also announced that the IRS Free File program is now available. This program will accept completed tax returns and hold them until they can be filed electronically once the IRS begins processing returns. 

If you have questions or need assistance with the PPP or your economic impact payment, please contact my offices. Contact information is at the end of this email.

 Thought of the day: “The time is always right to do what is right.” 
– Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
Coronavirus Update

On Monday, Michigan reported 2,843 new cases and 20 new deaths from COVID-19, bringing the state’s total case count to 538,377 and deaths to 13,824. Michigan has received 1,049,575 doses of the COVID-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna and has administered 487,959 doses of the life-saving vaccine. Last week, Governor Whitmer expanded the eligibility requirements for the vaccine to include people age 65 or older. This critical step will help Michigan speed up vaccinations and inoculate more Michiganders against the deadly virus. 
We have many challenges facing us in the coming days. Jeff Zients, who will head the COVID-19 efforts for the Biden Administration, characterized the current U.S. COVID-19 plan as “uneven at best” and largely consisted of dropping everything in state officials’ laps. “We’re struck by the incompetence across the board,” he underscored. “Worse than we could have imagined.” Not a good situation to walk into.
Joe Biden is making this his number one priority when he becomes President tomorrow. And he knows what must be done. We must increase vaccine production, which he will do through the Defense Production Act. We need to get more people vaccinated, set up more vaccination locations, and hire more personnel to administer shots. We must make sure they have the syringes, freezers, and all the other tools they need to get it done. And President-elect Biden will also ask all of us to wear our masks for the first 100 days to help slow the spread of the virus as health care workers work hard to vaccinate Americans. 
COVID-19 Vaccine Information

 Michigan is currently prioritizing COVID-19 vaccines for our most vulnerable populations. Currently, health care worker, long term care staff and residents, frontline essential workers, child care and pre-K through high school staff, and congregate care facility staff (homeless shelters, juvenile justice, and child care) qualify to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.

For more information on vaccine eligibility and appointments, please visit the Washtenaw County Health Department website.
 
 59th Presidential Inauguration

￼
Tomorrow, January 20, 2021 at 12 p.m. EST, Joe Biden will be sworn-in as the 46th President of the United States and Kamala Harris will be sworn-in as the first woman and first Black Vice President. The Biden-Harris inauguration is focused on bringing together and unifying our deeply fragmented country. Our nation faces so many challenges right now and will take all of us coming together as Americans to overcome these difficulties. I’m confident Joe Biden and Kamala Harris can help our nation heal and repair from the last four years of attacks on our government and our democratic institutions.
 This year’s inauguration will look different than any other due to security concerns and the COVID-19 health crisis. Although the public will not be allowed to attend the inaugural events, including the swearing in ceremony at the U.S. Capitol, Americans will be able to participate virtually in the inauguration. See below for a list of currently scheduled inaugural events.

 2020 Year In Review

￼

Despite the added complications of distance working and numerous Zoom meetings, I'm proud of the work we were able to accomplish last year. In 2020, my office assisted over 2,100 residents of Michigan’s 12th Congressional District, including our nation’s veterans, small business owners, and many more get the assistance they need; led the introduction of 27 bills to clean up toxic PFAS chemicals, improve access to health care, invest in the green energy economy of the future, and protect the American workforce; hosted 55 town halls and public events to hear directly from you on issues that are important to our community and provide information on available resources; responded to over 75,000 constituent emails and letters; and so much more. Despite the challenges of working through COVID, we worked quickly to adapt to our new way of working and delivered for Michigan’s 12th Congressional District. 

In 2021, our work will not slow down, there is so much to be done and we are ready to hit the ground running. We must renew our commitment to expanding access to health care; we must make significant investments in the green energy economy to combat the Climate Crisis and create millions of new jobs; we must make reforms to policing to ensure equitable enforcement of laws; we must rid our drinking water, food packaging products, and other waterways of toxic PFAS chemicals; and, after four years of Donald Trump eroding our institutions and the pillars of our democracy, we must make significant reforms to strengthen our democracy and root out corruption.

1/19/21 15:00,ICYMI - Representative Adriano Espaillat Urges Biden Administration to Keep Promise to 11 Million Immigrants,"￼ 
  

PRESS RELEASE
For Immediate Release
January 19, 2021


Representative Adriano Espaillat Urges Incoming Biden Administration to Keep Its Promise Creating Pathway to Citizenship for 11 Million Immigrants

""Our separate struggles are really one – a struggle for freedom, for dignity and for humanity. You and your fellow workers have demonstrated your commitment to righting grievous wrongs forced upon exploited people. We are together with you in spirit and in determination that our dreams for a better tomorrow will be realized."" – Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in a telegram to labor leader and civil rights activist, Cesar Chavez, in 1966.


NEW YORK, NY -- Today, Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) released the following statement and list of his recent immigration legislation to urge the incoming Biden administration to keep its promise to prioritize immigration during its first 100 days and create a pathway to citizenship for the nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants currently in America. 

""This week's inauguration of the incoming Biden-Harris administration will be historic for a number of reasons. While Democrats have assumed the majority in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the United States Senate, we will yet again have a Democratic White House and can effectively put into place policy solutions for the betterment of the American people and those seeking the American dream,"" said Rep. Espaillat.

""There is a real opportunity to set back our nation on a course that helps communities build back better, but also allows us to reverse the targeted attacks we have witnessed the last four years directed at immigrant communities around the nation. Promoting new policies that will improve our immigration system and protect immigrants from further harm will be critical to our future success, and I urge the incoming Biden adminstration to keep its promise to those who are seeking the dream of becoming American citizens, a dream that I hold dear, know too well, and cherish greatly,"" he continued.

""As President-elect Biden prepares to roll out numerous executive actions and major policies to address the challenges facing our nation, I urge him and the incoming adminstration to keep its promise to create a viable pathway to citizenship for the nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants, and to include some of the proposals that my Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) colleagues and I have introduced that will improve our immigration system and protect immigrants from abusive enforcement actions. As a nation, we simply cannot afford greater delay,"" he concluded.

The following legislation has been introduced by Rep. Espaillat and will be reintroduced during the 117th Congress to encourage collaboration with the Biden administration.

Protecting Sensitive Locations Act – H.R. 1011

Rep. Espaillat led five of of his Democratic colleagues in introducing legislation to limit immigration enforcement actions at ""sensitive locations,"" and to expand these safe zones to also include community health centers, school bus stops, courthouses, child care centers, and locations where emergency services providers offer shelter or food.

The Protecting Sensitive Locations Act would prohibit immigration enforcement, including arrests, interviews, searches, and surveillance in the following ""sensitive locations"": 
• Any medical treatment or health care facility, including any hospital, doctor’s office, accredited health clinic, or emergent or urgent care facility, or community health center
• Public and private schools (including pre-schools, primary schools, secondary schools, colleges and universities, and other institutions of learning such as vocational or trade schools)
• Any scholastic or education-related activity or event, including field trips and interscholastic events
• Any school bus or school bus stop during periods when school children are present
• Locations where emergency services providers provide shelter or food
• Any organization that assists children, pregnant women, victims of crime or abuse, or individuals with significant mental or physical disabilities; or provides disaster or emergency social services and assistance, including, but not limited to, food banks and homeless shelters
• Churches, synagogues, mosques, and other places of worship
• Sites of funerals, weddings, or other public religious ceremonies
• Sites during the occurrence of a public demonstration, such as a march, rally, or parade
• Any Federal, State, or local courthouse, including the office of an individual’s legal counsel or representative, and a probation office
• Congressional district offices
• Public assistance offices, Social Security offices, and employment training centers
• Locations where removal and asylum proceedings involving minors are taking place
• Childcare centers

Reunite Every Unaccompanied Newborn Infant Toddler and Other Children Expeditiously (REUNITE) Act – H.R. 1012 

Rep. Espaillat's bill would require DHS and HHS to publish guidance describing how they will reunify families and it would direct the Attorney General, Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish an Office for Locating and Reuniting Children with Parents to expedite and facilitate the reunification of children and parents separated after entering the United States. The bill would also require the agencies to determine how to ensure sustained, no-cost contact between parents and children, access to children by legal counsel and other advocates, and unannounced inspections by child welfare organizations. 

Additionally, the bill would also require daily-updated information about the location of their children and all scheduled immigration proceedings for their children, as well as the opportunity for parents to speak with their children – free of cost – not fewer than 3 times per week, including at least once by video. It would require agencies to use other techniques commonly utilized by United States courts for determining family relationships, including official documents, representations from a witness, parent, relative, or child, and observations of interactions between the adult and the child, but it would prohibit DHS from using any of the information obtained for immigration enforcement purposes. 

Finally, the bill redirects $50 million from ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) to enforcement of this Act, including providing legal counsel to children, and ensuring that children do not appear before a judge by themselves. 

ICE and CBP Body Camera Accountability Act – H.R. 1013

The ICE and CBP Body Camera Accountability Act would ensure that agents and officers of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) wear body cameras when such officers are engaged in official operations. There have been numerous concerning reports that agents have used coercive methods to extract information from immigrants, including DACA beneficiaries, and in some cases, have fabricated the testimonies they received. 

The ICE and CBP Body Camera Accountability would require:
• ICE and CBP officers to wear body cameras as soon as they are on duty.
• The Director of ICE and the Commissioner of CBP establish policies, procedures, and best practices for the use of body cameras by agents and officers of ICE and CBP, including training relating to the use of such cameras.
• That body cameras be turned on when the ICE officer or CBP agent begins their shift.
• An agent or officer of ICE or CBP whose body camera does not record footage because of a violation be subject to furlough, reduction in pay or grade, or a suspension of up to 30 days.
• Footage be made available to each party to any administrative proceeding, civil action, or criminal prosecution to which such footage pertains.

Rep. Espaillat led a bipartisan effort to secure the funds required to finally equip all CBP border agents with body cameras, and was able to get a directive approved that would require ICE to report to Congress on the status of its body camera pilot, so we can equip their officers with cameras in short order.

Family Reunification Act – H.R. 3312

In 1994, Congress authorized a new, temporary program that allowed undocumented immigrants who were otherwise eligible for visas through family relationships or job skills to become legal permanent residents without having to return to their country of origin. The program, known as “Section 245(i)” for its location in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), provided an important path to legalization for those with ties to the United States who could pass a criminal background check. This path to legal status became even more important after Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, implementing three- and 10-year bars on return for those who were unlawfully present in the United States, by allowing eligible applicants to circumvent those onerous bars.

Section 245(i) enjoyed bipartisan support and its application deadline was extended numerous times throughout the 1990s and into the early 2000s on bipartisan votes in both chambers. However, Congress has failed to extend this program since it closed in 2002. This left millions of eligible applicants without a path to legal status that would not separate them from their families. Some estimates put the number of current potential beneficiaries of the program at approximately 4 million.

Rep. Espaillat introduced the Family Reunification Act to reopen this critical path to legal status, shielding immigrants from the overly punitive three- and 10-year bars, by eliminating the application deadline originally enacted. The Espaillat bill would also shield from removal proceedings any individual who has an immigrant-visa application pending or is waiting in a long line for a visa to be issued. This measure will finally provide certainty to countless law-abiding immigrant families.

Congresista Adriano Espaillat insta a administración entrante de Biden a mantener su promesa de crear una vía hacia la ciudadanía para 11 millones de inmigrantes

""Nuestras luchas por separado son realmente una: una lucha por la libertad, la dignidad y la humanidad. Usted y sus compañeros de trabajo han demostrado su compromiso de corregir los graves males que se han impuesto a las personas explotadas. Estamos junto a ustedes en espíritu y en la determinación de que nuestros sueños por un mejor mañana se harán realidad"". - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. en un telegrama al líder sindical y activista de los derechos civiles, César Chávez, en 1966.


NEW YORK, NY – Hoy, el congresista Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) emitió la siguiente declaración y una lista de su reciente legislación sobre inmigración para instar a la administración entrante de Biden a mantener su promesa de priorizar el tema de inmigración durante sus primeros 100 días y crear una vía hacia la ciudadanía para los casi 11 millones de inmigrantes indocumentados que viven actualmente en los Estados Unidos.

""La toma de posesión de esta semana de la administración Biden-Harris será histórica por varias razones. Si bien los demócratas han asumido la mayoría tanto en la Cámara de Representantes como en el Senado de los Estados Unidos, volveremos a tener una Casa Blanca demócrata y podemos poner en práctica soluciones políticas para el mejoramiento del pueblo estadounidense y de quienes buscan el Sueño Americano"", dijo el Rep. Espaillat.

""Existe una oportunidad real de poner a nuestra nación en un curso que ayude a las comunidades a reconstruir mejor, pero también nos permite revertir los ataques selectivos que hemos presenciado en los últimos cuatro años dirigidos a las comunidades de inmigrantes en toda la nación. Promover nuevas políticas que mejoren nuestro sistema de inmigración y protejan a los inmigrantes de mayores daños será fundamental para nuestro éxito futuro, e insto a la administración entrante de Biden a que mantenga su promesa a aquellos que buscan el sueño de convertirse en ciudadanos estadounidenses, un sueño que valoro, conozco demasiado bien, y aprecio mucho"", continuó Espaillat.

""Mientras el presidente electo Biden se prepara para implementar numerosas acciones ejecutivas y políticas importantes para abordar los desafíos que enfrenta nuestra nación, le insto a él y a la administración entrante a mantener su promesa de crear un camino viable hacia la ciudadanía para los casi 11 millones de inmigrantes indocumentados, e incluir algunas de las propuestas que mis colegas del Caucus Hispano del Congreso (CHC) y yo hemos introducido, que mejorarán nuestro sistema de inmigración y protegerán a los inmigrantes de acciones policiales abusivas. Como nación, simplemente no podemos permitirnos una mayor demora"", concluyó.

La siguiente legislación ha sido introducida por el congresista Espaillat y se volverá a introducir durante el Congreso 117º para fomentar la colaboración con la administración Biden.

Ley de Protección de Lugares Sensibles – H.R. 1011

El Rep. Espaillat encabezó a cinco de sus colegas demócratas en la introducción de la legislación para limitar las acciones de aplicación de la ley de inmigración en ""lugares sensibles"" y para expandir estas zonas seguras con el fin de incluir también centros de salud comunitarios, paradas de autobuses escolares, juzgados, centros de cuidado infantil y lugares donde los proveedores de servicios de emergencia ofrecen refugio o comida.

La Ley de Protección de Lugares Sensibles prohibiría la aplicación de la ley de inmigración, incluidos arrestos, entrevistas, registros y vigilancia en los siguientes ""lugares sensibles"":

• Cualquier centro de tratamiento médico o de atención médica, incluido cualquier hospital, consultorio médico, clínica de salud acreditada o centro de atención de emergencia o urgencia, o centro de salud comunitario.
• Escuelas públicas y privadas (incluidos preescolares, escuelas primarias, escuelas secundarias, universidades de 2 y 4 años, y otras instituciones de aprendizaje, como escuelas vocacionales o comerciales)
• Cualquier actividad o evento escolar o relacionado con la educación, incluidas excursiones y eventos interescolares
• Cualquier autobús escolar o parada de autobús escolar durante los períodos en que los niños de la escuela están presentes
• Lugares donde los proveedores de servicios de emergencia brindan refugio o comida
• Cualquier organización que asista a niños, mujeres embarazadas, víctimas de delitos o abusos, o personas con discapacidades físicas o mentales significativas; o proporciona asistencia y servicios sociales de emergencia o de desastres, incluidos, entre otros, bancos de alimentos y refugios para personas sin hogar
• Iglesias, sinagogas, mezquitas y otros lugares de culto
• Sitios de funerales, bodas u otras ceremonias religiosas públicas
• Sitios durante la realización de una manifestación pública, como una marcha, mitin o desfile
• Cualquier tribunal federal, estatal o local, incluida la oficina del asesor o representante legal de una persona y una oficina de libertad condicional
• Oficinas distritales del Congreso
• Oficinas de asistencia pública, oficinas de la Seguridad Social y centros de entrenamiento laboral
• Lugares donde se llevan a cabo procedimientos de remoción y asilo que involucran a menores
• Centros de cuidado infantil

Ley de Reunir sin Demora a cada Niño Recién Nacido que Llegue sin Acompañante y a otros Niños (REUNITE )– H.R. 1012

El proyecto de ley del Rep. Espaillat requeriría que el DHS y el HHS publiquen una guía que describa cómo reunificarán a las familias y ordenaría al Fiscal General, al secretario de Seguridad Nacional y al secretario de Salud y Servicios Humanos que establezcan una Oficina para la Ubicación y Reunión de Niños con sus Padres para acelerar y facilitar la reunificación de niños y padres separados después de ingresar a los Estados Unidos. El proyecto de ley también requeriría que las agencias determinen cómo garantizar un contacto sostenido y sin costo entre padres e hijos, acceso a los niños por parte de asesores legales y otros defensores, e inspecciones sin previo aviso por parte de organizaciones de bienestar infantil.

Además, el proyecto de ley también requeriría información actualizada diariamente sobre la ubicación de sus hijos y todos los procedimientos de inmigración programados para sus hijos, así como la oportunidad para que los padres hablen con sus hijos -sin costo- no menos de 3 veces por semana, incluida al menos una vez por video. Requeriría que las agencias utilicen otras técnicas comúnmente utilizadas por los tribunales de los Estados Unidos para determinar las relaciones familiares, incluidos documentos oficiales, declaraciones de un testigo, padre, pariente o niño, y observaciones de interacciones entre el adulto y el niño, pero prohibiría que el DHS utilice la información obtenida con fines de aplicación de la ley de inmigración.

Finalmente, el proyecto de ley redirige $50 millones del ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) a la aplicación de esta ley, incluida la prestación de asesoramiento legal a los niños y garantizar que los niños no se presenten ante un juez por sí mismos.

Ley de Rendición de Cuentas de ICE y CBP con el Porte de Cámaras Corporales– H.R. 1013

Ley de Rendición de Cuentas de ICE y CBP con el Porte de Cámaras Corporales garantizaría que los agentes y oficiales del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) y la Oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP) usen cámaras corporales cuando dichos agentes estén involucrados en operaciones oficiales. Ha habido numerosos informes preocupantes de que los agentes han utilizado métodos coercitivos para extraer información de los inmigrantes, incluidos los beneficiarios de DACA, y en algunos casos, han fabricado los testimonios que recibieron.

Ley de Rendición de Cuentas de ICE y CBP con el Porte de Cámaras Corporales requerirá que:
• Los agentes de ICE y CBP deben usar cámaras corporales tan pronto como estén de servicio.
• El director de ICE y el comisionado de CBP establecen políticas, procedimientos y mejores prácticas para el uso de cámaras corporales por parte de agentes y oficiales de ICE y CBP, incluida la capacitación relacionada con el uso de dichas cámaras.
• Que las cámaras corporales se enciendan cuando el oficial de ICE o el agente de CBP comience su turno.
• Un agente u oficial de ICE o CBP cuya cámara corporal no grabe imágenes debido a una violación de la norma estará sujeto a cesantía, reducción de salario o grado, o una suspensión de hasta 30 días.
• Las imágenes estarán disponibles para cada parte en cualquier procedimiento administrativo, acción civil o enjuiciamiento criminal al que pertenezcan dichas imágenes.

El congresista Espaillat lideró un esfuerzo bipartidista para asegurar los fondos necesarios para finalmente equipar a todos los agentes fronterizos de CBP con cámaras corporales, y pudo obtener la aprobación de una directiva que requeriría que ICE informara al Congreso sobre el estado de su plan piloto de cámaras corporales, por lo que puede equipar a sus oficiales con cámaras en poco tiempo.

Ley de Reunificación Familiar – H.R. 3312

En 1994, el Congreso autorizó un nuevo programa temporal que permitía a los inmigrantes indocumentados que de todos modos eran elegibles para visas a través de relaciones familiares o destrezas laborales convertirse en residentes permanentes legales sin tener que regresar a su país de origen. El programa, conocido como “Sección 245 (i)” por su ubicación en la Ley de Inmigración y Nacionalidad (INA), proporcionó una vía importante hacia la legalización para aquellos con vínculos con los Estados Unidos que pudieran pasar una verificación de antecedentes penales. Esta vía hacia el estatus legal se volvió aún más importante después de que el Congreso promulgó la Ley de Reforma de Inmigración Ilegal y Ley de Responsabilidad Inmigratoria, implementando prohibiciones de retorno de tres y 10 años para aquellos que estaban presentes ilegalmente en los Estados Unidos, al permitir que los solicitantes elegibles eludan esas prohibiciones onerosas.
La Sección 245 (i) disfrutó del apoyo bipartidista y su fecha límite de solicitud se extendió varias veces a lo largo de la década de 1990 y principios de la de 2000 con votaciones bipartidistas en ambas cámaras. Sin embargo, el Congreso no ha extendido este programa desde que cerró en 2002. Esto dejó a millones de solicitantes elegibles sin un camino hacia un estatus legal que no los separara de sus familias. Algunas estimaciones sitúan el número de beneficiarios potenciales actuales del programa en aproximadamente 4 millones.

El Rep. Espaillat introdujo la Ley de Reunificación Familiar para reabrir este camino crítico hacia el estatus legal, protegiendo a los inmigrantes de las prohibiciones de retorno excesivamente punitivas de tres y diez años, al eliminar la fecha límite de solicitud promulgada originalmente. El proyecto de ley de Espaillat también protegería de los procedimientos de deportación a cualquier persona que tenga una solicitud de visa de inmigrante pendiente o que esté esperando en una larga fila para que se emita una visa. Esta medida finalmente brindará certeza a innumerables familias inmigrantes respetuosas de la ley.

Dear Friends,
We’ve been through a lot as a nation in these early days of 2021. I would like to thank you for the support and kind words I have received since the insurrection on our Capitol. I am working hard to hold those who incited, enabled, and participated accountable for their actions.
Despite the challenges and awful events in Washington, we must continue to focus on the COVID relief our country desperately needs. I’ve heard many questions and concerns regarding the COVID-19 vaccine distribution in New Jersey, the next round of PPP loans, EIDL and EIP stimulus checks. You can find details on federal programs and vaccine distribution below.
I’ll continue to send updates in newsletters and on my social media pages as more information is available. 
And finally, I would like to congratulate the local elected officials who were recently sworn in throughout the district. A bright spot for me during this difficult past year has been seeing how local officials have partnered together to support our residents. I look forward to working with all of you and supporting the work you undertake on behalf of your towns and your constituents.  
Best wishes and I hope that you and your loved ones stay safe and healthy,
￼
Mikie Sherrill


 
SMALL BUSINESS: PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM

Meeting with small business owners across the district during COVID, it is clear that the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) established by the CARES Act last March has been a lifeline during this crisis. In fact, $530 million in PPP loans under $150,000 came to NJ-11 in 2020. 

But it was also extremely clear that small businesses needed more relief. I was proud to vote for the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act (Economic Aid Act) as part of the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 that passed in December. This legislation reopened the PPP through March 31, 2021, with $284.45 billion in funding.

The PPP is reopening in stages. On Friday, January 15 it opened to lenders with less than $1 billion in assets. And it opens to ALL lenders on Tuesday, January 19. Similar to the first round of the PPP, small businesses and nonprofits should apply for the loans through a private lender. Large banks, community banks, and FinTech lenders are all taking applications. 

First Draw and Second Draw loans are available for eligible small businesses and nonprofits. 
	•	You may be eligible for a First Draw loan if you did not receive a PPP loan prior to August 8, 2020.  
	•	You may be eligible for a Second Draw loan if you already received and spent your First Draw, have 300 employees or less, and can demonstrate a 25% loss in revenue between comparable quarters in 2019 and 2020. 
Other highlights of the legislation with respect to PPP include a simplified 1-page loan forgiveness certification for those who received a loan of $150,000 or less and expanded use of PPP funds to include new expenses like PPE and some operational expenses. With respect to the tax treatment of PPP Loans, this provision clarified that gross income does not include any amount that would otherwise arise from the forgiveness of a PPP loan.

Please also reach out to my office at any time for additional assistance.       
SMALL BUSINESS: ECONOMIC INJURY DISASTER LOANS 
Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) have been another key part of the small business relief throughout COVID, with an excess of $600 million in loans coming to NJ-11 in 2020. The SBA has announced that as a result of the COVID relief legislation signed at the end of December it was extending the application deadline for the EIDL program to December 31, 2021.
The Economic Aid Act also made clarifications about the treatment of EIDL Advance Amounts with respect to the deduction from loan forgiveness (including retroactively) and exclusion from gross income for tax purposes. 
The EIDL Advance program is currently closed but was provided with an additional $20 billion through this legislation targeted to certain businesses. We will keep you updated when we have more information on reopening and eligibility requirements.

	•	Click here for details from the House Committee on Small Business on the deduction and taxation clarifications for EIDL Advance Amounts in the Economic Aid Act or here for a section by section summary of the legislation. 
 
 ECONOMIC IMPACT PAYMENTS
The December COVID-19 relief package we passed also included Economic Impact Payments (EIPs) of $600 for eligible individuals and $1,200 for eligible married couples. You can determine your eligibility and payment status on the IRS website by clicking here. These payments are being distributed by the Department of the Treasury throughout the month of January.
According to a briefing my team received this week from the House Ways and Means Committee, 147 million EIPs have already been distributed or are scheduled to be distributed. The vast majority of payments have been made electronically through direct deposit payments (when the IRS has your bank account information). Payments are also being made by paper checks and debit cards called EIP Cards. 
For those of you who are EIP Card recipients, I want to make you aware that:

CORONAVIRUS VACCINES 

While the coronavirus relief funding described above is critical to our community surviving this pandemic, we all know that a successful vaccine program is the key to getting to the other side of this crisis. This vaccination effort requires incredible collaboration between all levels of government, as well as our healthcare providers as I saw firsthand as I visited three vaccination sites around NJ-11 over the past few weeks. Morristown Medical for the first day of vaccines for our frontline healthcare workers in December, at the Morris County Regional Vaccination Center in Rockaway as it opened for vaccinations of first responders, and the Essex County site in West Orange last week. 

￼
Top, L to R: Rep. Sherrill went to Morristown Medical Center on December 15 as they vaccinated some of the first frontline healthcare workers; Rep. Sherrill visited the Kmart vaccination site in West Orange on January 11, with Essex County Executive Joe DiVincenzo and Sheriff Armando B. Fontoura. 
Bottom: Rep. Sherrill visited the Rockaway mega site opening with Governor Murphy on January 8.
As you may know, New Jersey is administering vaccines to residents in phases. Currently (as of 1/16/21), only those in Phases 1A and 1B are eligible for vaccines in New Jersey. You can find more detail on who is included in these phases at the New Jersey state website here. State and County portals where you can register for the vaccine are listed below, which will notify you when you are eligible for an appointment.   This process will require patience as the number of appointments for vaccinations can be limited by factors like the number of vaccine doses received each week by the state of New Jersey and the number of frontline workers available to administer shots. My team and I have been in touch with officials at Operation Warpspeed to understand what is being done to optimize the number of doses coming to New Jersey. And I was pleased to see that President-elect Biden’s relief plan proposed last week would provide essential funding for our country’s vaccination campaign.   Registration portals and other resources from the state of New Jersey and the counties about vaccines can be found below. You should also monitor information from your healthcare provider as appropriate to determine their capacity for vaccine appointments and sign up processes.    
State of New Jersey Vaccine Resources
State registration portal: You can pre-register for the vaccine here to determine which vaccination phase you are in and to receive a notification when you are eligible for a vaccine. We suggest you pre-register as soon as possible. If you were already pre-registered and are now eligible for the vaccine, you should receive an email soon alerting you to make an appointment for your first dose at a site near you.    Vaccine locations: List of statewide vaccine locations for eligible recipients here. Please keep in mind that appointments may be limited at some of these locations, and you should only show up when you have an appointment.   Information on insurance coverage and vaccines for the uninsured: More information on the lack of cost-sharing for COVID vaccines, and the availability to all regardless of insurance status.

1/19/21 13:14,Supporting AZ employers and saving AZ jobs,"￼ 
 
 
Lindsey, 

Even as our nation grapples with recent tragic events, my team and I continue to work around-the-clock to ensure Arizonans get critical resources to control the spread of coronavirus, save lives, and rebuild our economy. 

I'm reaching out to share an update on the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) - created to support employers and save jobs impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. 

On December 21, 2020, Congress passed the most recent bipartisan coronavirus relief package, including further support for employers impacted by COVID-19. The legislation provides more than $280 billion in new funding for forgivable Paycheck Protection Program loans, helping employers keep Arizonans on payroll. 

Changes to the Paycheck Protection Program include: 
	•	Expanded access to 501(c)(6) organizations  
	•	Additional covered costs eligible for forgiveness  
	•	A reapplication request process for eligible borrowers  
	•	Improved forgiveness for borrowers with principal amounts of $150,000 or less  
Recognizing the continued impact of the coronavirus on small businesses, the legislation also sets up a Second Draw Loan Program, for eligible small businesses to receive a second PPP loan. In addition to the original requirements, these businesses must: 
	•	Have received and utilized a First Draw loan  
	•	Employ no more than 300 individuals  
	•	Provide documentation of at least a 25 percent decrease in revenues in any quarter of 2020 as compared to revenues from the same quarter in 2019  
The maximum second draw loan amount is capped at $2 million. 

Small businesses can check their eligibility and learn more about Paycheck Protection Program loans and how to apply HERE. 

The Small Business Administration announced that the Paycheck Protection Program will close on March 31, 2021. 

My staff continues to work individually with Arizona businesses that have applied for the Paycheck Protection Program. If you need assistance, email casework@sinema.senate.gov or call 602-598-7327. 

We'll keep updating our website regularly to provide Arizona businesses with more information on how they can access new support: https://www.sinema.senate.gov/corona/businesses. 

Sincerely,

￼

 Dear Friend,  
On Wednesday, January 20, our nation will come together and celebrate the 59th Presidential Inauguration, swearing in Joe Biden as President and Kamala Harris as Vice President.  
In light of recent safety concerns, and following public health guidance amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies has announced that it will significantly limit in-person attendance at the inauguration. The National Mall will also be closed. You can join the largely virtual inauguration ceremonies online or via your local television provider. The ceremonies begin at 10:00 AM.  
￼ 



Building Back Better for the American People  
The inauguration comes at an incredibly fraught and difficult moment for our country -- arguably one of the most challenging times in American history. But it also offers us hope.  
Alongside the Biden Administration, my colleagues and I in the new Democratic Congress will work to advance several critical priorities for the American people:  
	•	Ending the Pandemic, Saving Lives and Supercharging America's Economic Recovery: As a result of the Trump Administration's willful negligence, incompetence and abject failure to protect our country from COVID-19, we remain in the throes of a raging pandemic that has killed nearly 400,000 Americans and led to devastating job losses and economic displacement. In the days ahead, we will move swiftly to pass President Biden's American Rescue Plan to deliver urgently needed relief to American families, small businesses, schools, hospitals, health care providers and state and local governments. The package will also implement a national strategy to get the virus under control and improve the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine to every American. The American Rescue Plan will help our country get to the other side of this crisis, put our economy back on track and offer us the opportunity to rebuild and recover in an equitable way for every community across the nation.  
	•	Cleaning Up Washington and Restoring Trust: To confront the daunting challenges that face our nation, we must strengthen our democratic institutions and restore the public's confidence in our government. That's why Democrats have made H.R. 1, the For the People Act, our first priority. This transformational anti-corruption and clean elections bill -- which I proudly assembled as Chair of the Democracy Reform Task Force -- will protect the right to vote, ensure the integrity of our elections, hold elected officials accountable and end the era of big, secret, special-interest money in our politics. Once we revive our democracy and restore public trust in our government, we can deliver the kind of sweeping and empowering change that Americans want to see.  
	•	Delivering Racial Justice and Equality: The promise of America continues to be betrayed by police officers who do not value Black lives, by prosecutors who turn a blind eye to racial injustice and, more broadly, by systems of power and privilege that are all too comfortable with the status quo. The anger and frustration that keeps boiling over in so many communities across our country is real -- and it is warranted. We must end this corruption of justice. That's why I am committed to advancing several critical efforts in Congress, like the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, the End Racial Profiling Act, the Commission on Truth, Racial Healing and Transformation and the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act, along with many other racial justice reforms, to help make our country live up to its promises and provide equal opportunity for every American in every community.  
	•	Lowering the Cost of Health Care and Prescription Drugs: For far too long, wealthy pharmaceutical companies have called the shots in Washington and saddled Americans with out-of-control and unaffordable prescription drug prices. But Big Pharma is due for a reckoning. As a long-serving member of the House Health Subcommittee, I've helped advance many proposals to reduce the cost of prescription drugs -- including the landmark Elijah E. Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act -- and to make health care more affordable. Working closely with my colleagues in Congress and with the Biden Administration, we will advance legislation to reduce prescription drug prices, lower out-of-pocket costs for seniors, protect Americans with pre-existing conditions and increase access to high-quality and affordable care.  
	•	Acting Swiftly on Climate Change and Climate Justice, and Protecting the Chesapeake Bay: 2020 just tied 2016 as the warmest year on record. We cannot wait another moment to act on climate. As a newly minted member of the House Environment and Climate Change Subcommittee, I look forward to working with the Biden Administration as we quickly rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, reduce our carbon footprint, make robust investments in renewable energy and infrastructure, bring our electric grid into the 21st Century and put America back on the path to a clean energy future. At the same time, I will continue my role as Co-Chair of the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Task Force and build on the incredible success we've had over the last couple of years to protect the health and vitality of the Chesapeake Bay so that our children and grandchildren can enjoy this national environmental treasure for years to come.  
	•	And many other priorities: From to LGBTQ+ rights to gun safety and from paycheck fairness and better wages to veterans benefits, we will work to make life better and build a more just, equitable and successful country for all Americans.  
In closing, I want to extend warm wishes to you and your families for a safe, healthy, hopeful and prosperous year ahead.  
Please remember that my office is always available to help you and your families access important federal services and benefits, like Social Security and Medicare. If you need assistance, please send me an email or call (410) 832-8890 during normal business hours. 
Onward,  ￼ John P. Sarbanes Maryland's Third Congressional District

1/19/21 10:20,Weekly Update:  Why I voted no on impeachment,"

Weekly Update | January 16, 2021
￼

Why I Voted No On Impeachment

We are at a perilous moment in our Nation’s history. President Trump, many of his allies in Congress, and media commentators on the right deserve blame for the circumstances that led up to one of the worst days this great country has ever seen. Since November, many in my party perpetuated the lie that the election was “stolen” and gave false hope to millions that the president could somehow remain in office after January 20th. That was never going to happen. There must be accountability for leaders who deliberately misled the public, but I fear that without thoughtful and clear-eyed leadership from both sides of the aisle, we are in danger of further violence and political unrest. 

While a convenient talking point, we must be honest that our country did not arrive at this moment in the last two months, or simply the last four years. Though many prefer not to admit it, political deception is a bipartisan disease that seems only to worsen and lead to violence. Last Wednesday is the second time in my short Congressional career that I’ve needed to thank law enforcement for saving my life during an act of political violence. The former because a deranged gunman believed leaders and agitators on the left that I and my Republican colleagues were a danger to America. We as a country have got to do better.

There must be a full accounting of what happened leading up to and on the day of January 6th. Law enforcement must have all resources necessary to bring the perpetrators to justice. That investigation should be unimpeded and free from partisan influence. The investigation should be conducted in such a manner to sooth tensions and provide the public with confidence that law and order will prevail. 

Process matters. A snap impeachment conducted without a full investigation or without due process for the president accomplishes nothing. At a time when political tensions are at an all-time high, impeachment will drive people further into their corners and could lead to additional violence. Unlike what some Democratic leaders are saying, President Trump will not be removed from office under this process. The Democrats’ stated goal to punish the president and bar him from seeking federal office in the future certainly isn’t urgent. He will be removed from office under the law in less than one week. We need to lower temperatures, not enflame them. If, when a full accounting of the facts of January 6th comes in, Pelosi and the Democrats wish to punish President Trump, they can pursue that process with their party’s total control of the legislative and executive branches of the federal government. 

Our nation needs sober-minded leaders who will sooth a wounded electorate. President-elect Biden has missed an opportunity to act on his promise of unifying the country by calling for calm and pledging to listen to those who feel so ignored by our elected leaders. He is now the face of his party and will be the legitimately elected leader of our country in a matter days. I stand ready to work with President-elect Biden on solutions to the many problems our country faces. We should all wish President Biden success, for when he succeeds, our nation succeeds.

Political Violence of Any Kind is Unacceptable

The rioting and violence I saw and heard at the Capitol last week brought back painful memories of the Congressional baseball shooting in Virginia a few short years ago. Political violence of any kind is never acceptable and must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. It’s unpatriotic and un-American. Political leaders, from Congress to the White House, have an obligation to be voices of reason and calming in times of national crisis. That time is now.

The peaceful transfer of power is a bedrock principle of American democracy. Members of Congress must uphold our oaths to the Constitution, do our jobs, and resume the process of governing our great Nation. I want to thank the men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police and others in the law enforcement community who put their lives on the line every single day to keep us safe. They have an extremely difficult and dangerous job. Please pray for them and their families and pray for our great Nation.

This week I was glad to be able to visit with Mr. Kunde's Current Events students at Monticello High School. I always enjoy the opportunity to be able to answer questions from some of my youngest constituents about what's going on in Washington. There was no shortage of topics to cover. It was also nice to see the school's newly renovated auditorium which will improve the student experience there for generations to come.

Weekly Wrap-Up from Congressman Donalds
                                   January 19, 2021
 
 
As I close my second week in Congress, I have seen firsthand why Congress has such a low approval rating. Following the horrific attack on Capitol Hill, my hope was to join my fellow members in bringing forth common-sense solutions to issues facing the American people—this week was a far cry from that. Although last week was dedicated to impeaching an outgoing president, I continued to work hard for all of you back home. This week I met with several lawmakers and stakeholders in Washington and back home, continuing my efforts to push forth a conservative agenda that uplifts and empowers all Americans. 
 
It's been a historic first two weeks in Congress, and the work has only just begun. Read more for highlights from last week.
 

 
 
Celebrating Dr. Martin Luther King Jr
 
As a nation, we have seen many trials, but together we have reached many triumphs through faith and unity. During some of our nation's darkest hours, Dr. King's message provided a nation with hope and the affirmation that there were brighter days ahead. In one of his speeches, Dr. King once asked Americans, ""Life’s most persistent and urgent question is what are you doing for others?"" It is that kind of inspiration, of leading a life of service and selflessness, that is legacy of Martin Luther King.
 
May we all never stop dreaming, and working towards a better America. 
￼

 
 
Impeachment Vote of President Trump
 
 
Last week, under Nancy Pelosi's leadership, the House of Representatives once again brought forth a vote to impeach President Donald Trump. While the legislation did pass with a vote of 232-197, I did not support the resolution for many reasons. 
 
In the days following the horrific attack on the United States Capitol, our nation does not need further division by attempting to remove an outgoing president. Leaders in Washington and across our country have unequivocally denounced the violence and terror exhibited last week. President Trump has committed to ensuring a smooth and orderly transition of power to President-elect Joe Biden. At this moment, our nation is in desperate need of unity. I have rejected this ill-advised motion that will do nothing but sew tremendous anger and resentment among the country.
 
The Congress has spoken by certifying the results of the Electoral College. The Trump Administration will soon become the Biden Administration. As the world's oldest surviving democracy, we must reaffirm our commitment to a peaceful transition of power.

Legislative Updates
 
 
Last week, I signed on to a letter along with several members fo the Florida Congressional Delegation to the Secretary of the U.S. International Trade Commission. My colleagues and I wrote to Secretary Lisa Barton to voice our growing concerns over the increasing number of imported produce, which has directly resulted in significant job loss and economic capabilities to Florida's farmers and growers.  We are optimistic that the ITC will bring forth efforts to investigate this influx of imported produce, and work towards providing meaningful relief to Florida's farmers and growers. 
 
 

 
 
In The Media

1/18/21 21:02,District Update: Honoring the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.,"COVID-19 Update | January 18, 2021
View Email in Browser 
￼ 
Dear Friends, 
Last Friday, I was proud to join the Arkansas Martin Luther King, Jr. Commission to celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
His work to promote peace, nonviolence, human equality, diversity, and reconciliation inspires nations and will be celebrated for generations to come.
Dr. King once said, “Life’s most persistent and urgent question is, ‘What are you doing for others?’” He realized that service to others is the key to a purpose-filled life.
Given the events of recent weeks, especially the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, his message is imperative, as the unity we need will not be found in bitter partisan division, civil unrest, and political brinksmanship.
I pray that, as we transition into a new presidential administration and a new Congress, the values Dr. King stood for can once again echo in the halls of U.S. Congress and among families around the dinner table alike.
I offer my congratulations to the Arkansas Martin Luther King, Jr. Commission on their 28 years of important and impactful work throughout Arkansas continuing his legacy through service.

ANNOUNCING CO-CHAIRMANSHIP OF CONGRESSIONAL HBCU CAUCUS 


I am honored to announce that I have been selected to co-chair the Bipartisan Historically Black Colleges and Universities Caucus for the 117th Congress alongside Rep. Alma Adams (NC-12) and Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) and Sen. Tim Scott (R-SC).

For thousands of students in Arkansas and across the country, HBCUs like Arkansas Baptist College, Philander Smith College, Shorter College, and the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff offer the essential tools to help students pursue the American Dream. I look forward to working with Senator Coons, Senator Scott, and Representative Adams to address the unique challenges that HBCUs face and expand opportunities for Black students. Our Caucus is committed to creating a national bipartisan dialogue about issues facing HBCUs and crafting legislation to support HBCUs and increase access to career opportunities for their students.

As we start the 117th Congress, my colleagues and I seek to address the unique challenges that HBCUs face and expand opportunities for Black students.

I look forward to working with Sen. Coons, Sen. Scott, and Rep. Adams to reach across the aisle and the Capitol to start a national dialogue about how to bolster our HBCUs — be it legislation or engaging with our businesses large and small to increase career opportunities.

INTRODUCING BIPARTISAN RESOLUTION TO HONOR U.S. CAPITOL POLICE
Last week, with my colleague Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-CO), I introduced H.Res.39 to honor United States Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick and Officer Howard Liebengood, as well as the entire Capitol Police force and other federal and local law enforcement officers who courageously defended the U.S. Capitol during the attack of January 6, 2021.
I was humbled and honored to join Rep. Perlmutter in expressing our deep admiration and gratitude for the heroic actions of the men and women of the United States Capitol Police and to remember Officer Sicknick and Officer Liebengood, whom we lost in the days after the attack. My family and I pray for their families and for the continued safety of the entire United States Capitol Police force and federal, state, and local law enforcement officers across the country.
View the full text of the resolution HERE.

VOTING AGAINST THE IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT TRUMP

After the horrific, catastrophic attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6th by a mob committed to disrupting the work of democracy, our nation cries out for leadership.

In the wake of the attack, our leaders should have worked toward healing our wounds, both physical and spiritual. Instead, Speaker Pelosi held a vote to impeach the president.

President Trump was wrong to claim no responsibility for the toxic rhetoric that is directly connected to the attack on our Capitol. Likewise, President-Elect Biden should have followed up his calls for unity with concrete action and called for the Speaker to put an end to her plans for impeachment.

The leadership and unity our nation needs did not start with the Speaker's snap impeachment, which is why I voted against the article of impeachment against President Trump.

Going forward, we must honor our Constitution, preserve our Republic, and call on all Americans to advance the good of our nation.

RECEIVING YOUR ECONOMIC IMPACT PAYMENTS

Friday, January 15th was the deadline to receive an Economic Impact Payment (EIP) via direct deposit.
It may take several weeks for you to receive this payment in the form of a paper check of an EIP pre-paid debit card. The IRS is still working to issue those to Arkansans.
If you are eligible for an EIP but do not receive one, you may be able to claim a Recovery Rebate Credit in your 2020 income tax. I encourage Arkansans to file their taxes as soon as possible. As per the IRS, even if you usually don’t file taxes, it is the only way to claim your first and/or second EIP.
For more information on the Economic Impact Payments and the Recovery Rebate Credit, please visit the IRS website HERE.
If you have questions, please contact me at (501) 324-5941 or Hill.House.Gov.

MEETING WITH ARKANSAS’S HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY

On Wednesday, I met with members of the Arkansas Hospitality Association. We discussed the challenges they have faced during the pandemic and the resources in the recently passed COVID relief bill that will provide much needed aid such as an extension of the Paycheck Protection Program. 
Thank you to Edward Haddock from the SBA and the 16 hospitality leaders who joined me to discuss these important topics facing the Arkansas hospitality industry. I stand at the ready to continue our partnership and improve the economic circumstances for the important hospitality sector in Arkansas.

DISCUSSING CHINA’S COVID-19 MISHANDLING
China is continuing its cover-up of the coronavirus outbreak. Last Thursday, the Chinese Communist Party blocked World Health Organization investigators from beginning their investigation into the origins of the pandemic.
I joined Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business’s “Mornings with Maria” to discuss the U.S.-China relationship. China withheld key information about COVID-19 from the outset, allowing the pandemic to spread. As we move into a new administration, I look forward to working across the aisle to hold China accountable.

STANDING UP FOR CHRISTIANS IN EGYPT
I have made religious freedom a central point of my foreign policy agenda in Congress.  This includes not only legislation but working with legislators around through world.
On Friday, I was honored to speak at a briefing on confronting the persecution of Egypt’s Coptic Christian community hosted by In Defense of Christians.
Addressing the Coptic crisis issue has been at the top of my foreign policy agenda since 2017 when I first introduced a resolution supporting Coptic Christians in Egypt and calling for an end to the Egyptian government’s culture of impunity.
I look forward to working with my House colleagues on legislation in the 117th Congress that calls for an end to the persecution of Coptic Christians in Egypt and holds the Egyptian government accountable for its actions against those who seek the very religious freedom we enjoy here in America.
I extend my thanks to IDC’s Advocacy Director Steven Howard for inviting me to speak at this important event.

1/18/21 17:43,Representative Adriano Espaillat Urges Biden Administration to Keep Its Promise Creating Pathway to Citizenship for 11 Million Immigrants,"￼ 
  

PRESS RELEASE
For Immediate Release
January 18, 2021


Representative Adriano Espaillat Urges Incoming Biden Administration to Keep Its Promise Creating Pathway to Citizenship for 11 Million Immigrants

""Our separate struggles are really one – a struggle for freedom, for dignity and for humanity. You and your fellow workers have demonstrated your commitment to righting grievous wrongs forced upon exploited people. We are together with you in spirit and in determination that our dreams for a better tomorrow will be realized."" – Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in a telegram to labor leader and civil rights activist, Cesar Chavez, in 1966.


NEW YORK, NY -- Today, Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) released the following statement and list of his recent immigration legislation to urge the incoming Biden administration to keep its promise to prioritize immigration during its first 100 days and create a pathway to citizenship for the nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants currently in America. 

""This week's inauguration of the incoming Biden-Harris administration will be historic for a number of reasons. While Democrats have assumed the majority in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the United States Senate, we will yet again have a Democratic White House and can effectively put into place policy solutions for the betterment of the American people and those seeking the American dream,"" said Rep. Espaillat.

""There is a real opportunity to set back our nation on a course that helps communities build back better, but also allows us to reverse the targeted attacks we have witnessed the last four years directed at immigrant communities around the nation. Promoting new policies that will improve our immigration system and protect immigrants from further harm will be critical to our future success, and I urge the incoming Biden adminstration to keep its promise to those who are seeking the dream of becoming American citizens, a dream that I hold dear, know too well, and cherish greatly,"" he continued.

""As President-elect Biden prepares to roll out numerous executive actions and major policies to address the challenges facing our nation, I urge him and the incoming adminstration to keep its promise to create a viable pathway to citizenship for the nearly 11 million undocumented immigrants, and to include some of the proposals I have introduced during my time in Congress that will improve our immigration system and protect immigrants from abusive enforcement actions. As a nation, we simply cannot afford greater delay,"" he concluded.

The following legislation has been introduced by Rep. Espaillat and will be reintroduced during the 117th Congress to encourage collaboration with the Biden administration.

Protecting Sensitive Locations Act – H.R. 1011

Rep. Espaillat led five of of his Democratic colleagues in introducing legislation to limit immigration enforcement actions at ""sensitive locations,"" and to expand these safe zones to also include community health centers, school bus stops, courthouses, child care centers, and locations where emergency services providers offer shelter or food.

The Protecting Sensitive Locations Act would prohibit immigration enforcement, including arrests, interviews, searches, and surveillance in the following ""sensitive locations"": 
• Any medical treatment or health care facility, including any hospital, doctor’s office, accredited health clinic, or emergent or urgent care facility, or community health center
• Public and private schools (including pre-schools, primary schools, secondary schools, colleges and universities, and other institutions of learning such as vocational or trade schools)
• Any scholastic or education-related activity or event, including field trips and interscholastic events
• Any school bus or school bus stop during periods when school children are present
• Locations where emergency services providers provide shelter or food
• Any organization that assists children, pregnant women, victims of crime or abuse, or individuals with significant mental or physical disabilities; or provides disaster or emergency social services and assistance, including, but not limited to, food banks and homeless shelters
• Churches, synagogues, mosques, and other places of worship
• Sites of funerals, weddings, or other public religious ceremonies
• Sites during the occurrence of a public demonstration, such as a march, rally, or parade
• Any Federal, State, or local courthouse, including the office of an individual’s legal counsel or representative, and a probation office
• Congressional district offices
• Public assistance offices, Social Security offices, and employment training centers
• Locations where removal and asylum proceedings involving minors are taking place
• Childcare centers

Reunite Every Unaccompanied Newborn Infant Toddler and Other Children Expeditiously (REUNITE) Act – H.R. 1012 

Rep. Espaillat's bill would require DHS and HHS to publish guidance describing how they will reunify families and it would direct the Attorney General, Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish an Office for Locating and Reuniting Children with Parents to expedite and facilitate the reunification of children and parents separated after entering the United States. The bill would also require the agencies to determine how to ensure sustained, no-cost contact between parents and children, access to children by legal counsel and other advocates, and unannounced inspections by child welfare organizations. 

Additionally, the bill would also require daily-updated information about the location of their children and all scheduled immigration proceedings for their children, as well as the opportunity for parents to speak with their children – free of cost – not fewer than 3 times per week, including at least once by video. It would require agencies to use other techniques commonly utilized by United States courts for determining family relationships, including official documents, representations from a witness, parent, relative, or child, and observations of interactions between the adult and the child, but it would prohibit DHS from using any of the information obtained for immigration enforcement purposes. 

Finally, the bill redirects $50 million from ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) to enforcement of this Act, including providing legal counsel to children, and ensuring that children do not appear before a judge by themselves. 

ICE and CBP Body Camera Accountability Act – H.R. 1013

The ICE and CBP Body Camera Accountability Act would ensure that agents and officers of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Customs and Border Patrol (CBP) wear body cameras when such officers are engaged in official operations. There have been numerous concerning reports that agents have used coercive methods to extract information from immigrants, including DACA beneficiaries, and in some cases, have fabricated the testimonies they received. 

The ICE and CBP Body Camera Accountability would require:
• ICE and CBP officers to wear body cameras as soon as they are on duty.
• The Director of ICE and the Commissioner of CBP establish policies, procedures, and best practices for the use of body cameras by agents and officers of ICE and CBP, including training relating to the use of such cameras.
• That body cameras be turned on when the ICE officer or CBP agent begins their shift.
• An agent or officer of ICE or CBP whose body camera does not record footage because of a violation be subject to furlough, reduction in pay or grade, or a suspension of up to 30 days.
• Footage be made available to each party to any administrative proceeding, civil action, or criminal prosecution to which such footage pertains.

Rep. Espaillat led a bipartisan effort to secure the funds required to finally equip all CBP border agents with body cameras, and was able to get a directive approved that would require ICE to report to Congress on the status of its body camera pilot, so we can equip their officers with cameras in short order.

Family Reunification Act – H.R. 3312

In 1994, Congress authorized a new, temporary program that allowed undocumented immigrants who were otherwise eligible for visas through family relationships or job skills to become legal permanent residents without having to return to their country of origin. The program, known as “Section 245(i)” for its location in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), provided an important path to legalization for those with ties to the United States who could pass a criminal background check. This path to legal status became even more important after Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, implementing three- and 10-year bars on return for those who were unlawfully present in the United States, by allowing eligible applicants to circumvent those onerous bars.

Section 245(i) enjoyed bipartisan support and its application deadline was extended numerous times throughout the 1990s and into the early 2000s on bipartisan votes in both chambers. However, Congress has failed to extend this program since it closed in 2002. This left millions of eligible applicants without a path to legal status that would not separate them from their families. Some estimates put the number of current potential beneficiaries of the program at approximately 4 million.

Rep. Espaillat introduced the Family Reunification Act to reopen this critical path to legal status, shielding immigrants from the overly punitive three- and 10-year bars, by eliminating the application deadline originally enacted. The Espaillat bill would also shield from removal proceedings any individual who has an immigrant-visa application pending or is waiting in a long line for a visa to be issued. This measure will finally provide certainty to countless law-abiding immigrant families.

Congresista Adriano Espaillat insta a administración entrante de Biden a mantener su promesa de crear una vía hacia la ciudadanía para 11 millones de inmigrantes

""Nuestras luchas por separado son realmente una: una lucha por la libertad, la dignidad y la humanidad. Usted y sus compañeros de trabajo han demostrado su compromiso de corregir los graves males que se han impuesto a las personas explotadas. Estamos junto a ustedes en espíritu y en la determinación de que nuestros sueños por un mejor mañana se harán realidad"". - Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. en un telegrama al líder sindical y activista de los derechos civiles, César Chávez, en 1966.


NEW YORK, NY – Hoy, el congresista Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) emitió la siguiente declaración y una lista de su reciente legislación sobre inmigración para instar a la administración entrante de Biden a mantener su promesa de priorizar el tema de inmigración durante sus primeros 100 días y crear una vía hacia la ciudadanía para los casi 11 millones de inmigrantes indocumentados que viven actualmente en los Estados Unidos.

""La toma de posesión de esta semana de la administración Biden-Harris será histórica por varias razones. Si bien los demócratas han asumido la mayoría tanto en la Cámara de Representantes como en el Senado de los Estados Unidos, volveremos a tener una Casa Blanca demócrata y podemos poner en práctica soluciones políticas para el mejoramiento del pueblo estadounidense y de quienes buscan el Sueño Americano"", dijo el Rep. Espaillat.

""Existe una oportunidad real de poner a nuestra nación en un curso que ayude a las comunidades a reconstruir mejor, pero también nos permite revertir los ataques selectivos que hemos presenciado en los últimos cuatro años dirigidos a las comunidades de inmigrantes en toda la nación. Promover nuevas políticas que mejoren nuestro sistema de inmigración y protejan a los inmigrantes de mayores daños será fundamental para nuestro éxito futuro, e insto a la administración entrante de Biden a que mantenga su promesa a aquellos que buscan el sueño de convertirse en ciudadanos estadounidenses, un sueño que valoro, conozco demasiado bien, y aprecio mucho"", continuó Espaillat.

""Mientras el presidente electo Biden se prepara para implementar numerosas acciones ejecutivas y políticas importantes para abordar los desafíos que enfrenta nuestra nación, le insto a él y a la administración entrante a mantener su promesa de crear un camino viable hacia la ciudadanía para los casi 11 millones de inmigrantes indocumentados, e incluir algunas de las propuestas que he introducido durante mi tiempo en el Congreso que mejorarán nuestro sistema de inmigración y protegerán a los inmigrantes de acciones policiales abusivas. Como nación, simplemente no podemos permitirnos una mayor demora"", concluyó.

La siguiente legislación ha sido introducida por el congresista Espaillat y se volverá a introducir durante el Congreso 117º para fomentar la colaboración con la administración Biden.

Ley de Protección de Lugares Sensibles – H.R. 1011

El Rep. Espaillat encabezó a cinco de sus colegas demócratas en la introducción de la legislación para limitar las acciones de aplicación de la ley de inmigración en ""lugares sensibles"" y para expandir estas zonas seguras con el fin de incluir también centros de salud comunitarios, paradas de autobuses escolares, juzgados, centros de cuidado infantil y lugares donde los proveedores de servicios de emergencia ofrecen refugio o comida.

La Ley de Protección de Lugares Sensibles prohibiría la aplicación de la ley de inmigración, incluidos arrestos, entrevistas, registros y vigilancia en los siguientes ""lugares sensibles"":

• Cualquier centro de tratamiento médico o de atención médica, incluido cualquier hospital, consultorio médico, clínica de salud acreditada o centro de atención de emergencia o urgencia, o centro de salud comunitario.
• Escuelas públicas y privadas (incluidos preescolares, escuelas primarias, escuelas secundarias, universidades de 2 y 4 años, y otras instituciones de aprendizaje, como escuelas vocacionales o comerciales)
• Cualquier actividad o evento escolar o relacionado con la educación, incluidas excursiones y eventos interescolares
• Cualquier autobús escolar o parada de autobús escolar durante los períodos en que los niños de la escuela están presentes
• Lugares donde los proveedores de servicios de emergencia brindan refugio o comida
• Cualquier organización que asista a niños, mujeres embarazadas, víctimas de delitos o abusos, o personas con discapacidades físicas o mentales significativas; o proporciona asistencia y servicios sociales de emergencia o de desastres, incluidos, entre otros, bancos de alimentos y refugios para personas sin hogar
• Iglesias, sinagogas, mezquitas y otros lugares de culto
• Sitios de funerales, bodas u otras ceremonias religiosas públicas
• Sitios durante la realización de una manifestación pública, como una marcha, mitin o desfile
• Cualquier tribunal federal, estatal o local, incluida la oficina del asesor o representante legal de una persona y una oficina de libertad condicional
• Oficinas distritales del Congreso
• Oficinas de asistencia pública, oficinas de la Seguridad Social y centros de entrenamiento laboral
• Lugares donde se llevan a cabo procedimientos de remoción y asilo que involucran a menores
• Centros de cuidado infantil

Ley de Reunir sin Demora a cada Niño Recién Nacido que Llegue sin Acompañante y a otros Niños (REUNITE )– H.R. 1012

El proyecto de ley del Rep. Espaillat requeriría que el DHS y el HHS publiquen una guía que describa cómo reunificarán a las familias y ordenaría al Fiscal General, al secretario de Seguridad Nacional y al secretario de Salud y Servicios Humanos que establezcan una Oficina para la Ubicación y Reunión de Niños con sus Padres para acelerar y facilitar la reunificación de niños y padres separados después de ingresar a los Estados Unidos. El proyecto de ley también requeriría que las agencias determinen cómo garantizar un contacto sostenido y sin costo entre padres e hijos, acceso a los niños por parte de asesores legales y otros defensores, e inspecciones sin previo aviso por parte de organizaciones de bienestar infantil.

Además, el proyecto de ley también requeriría información actualizada diariamente sobre la ubicación de sus hijos y todos los procedimientos de inmigración programados para sus hijos, así como la oportunidad para que los padres hablen con sus hijos -sin costo- no menos de 3 veces por semana, incluida al menos una vez por video. Requeriría que las agencias utilicen otras técnicas comúnmente utilizadas por los tribunales de los Estados Unidos para determinar las relaciones familiares, incluidos documentos oficiales, declaraciones de un testigo, padre, pariente o niño, y observaciones de interacciones entre el adulto y el niño, pero prohibiría que el DHS utilice la información obtenida con fines de aplicación de la ley de inmigración.

Finalmente, el proyecto de ley redirige $50 millones del ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) a la aplicación de esta ley, incluida la prestación de asesoramiento legal a los niños y garantizar que los niños no se presenten ante un juez por sí mismos.

Ley de Rendición de Cuentas de ICE y CBP con el Porte de Cámaras Corporales– H.R. 1013

Ley de Rendición de Cuentas de ICE y CBP con el Porte de Cámaras Corporales garantizaría que los agentes y oficiales del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas (ICE) y la Oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza (CBP) usen cámaras corporales cuando dichos agentes estén involucrados en operaciones oficiales. Ha habido numerosos informes preocupantes de que los agentes han utilizado métodos coercitivos para extraer información de los inmigrantes, incluidos los beneficiarios de DACA, y en algunos casos, han fabricado los testimonios que recibieron.

Ley de Rendición de Cuentas de ICE y CBP con el Porte de Cámaras Corporales requerirá que:
• Los agentes de ICE y CBP deben usar cámaras corporales tan pronto como estén de servicio.
• El director de ICE y el comisionado de CBP establecen políticas, procedimientos y mejores prácticas para el uso de cámaras corporales por parte de agentes y oficiales de ICE y CBP, incluida la capacitación relacionada con el uso de dichas cámaras.
• Que las cámaras corporales se enciendan cuando el oficial de ICE o el agente de CBP comience su turno.
• Un agente u oficial de ICE o CBP cuya cámara corporal no grabe imágenes debido a una violación de la norma estará sujeto a cesantía, reducción de salario o grado, o una suspensión de hasta 30 días.
• Las imágenes estarán disponibles para cada parte en cualquier procedimiento administrativo, acción civil o enjuiciamiento criminal al que pertenezcan dichas imágenes.

El congresista Espaillat lideró un esfuerzo bipartidista para asegurar los fondos necesarios para finalmente equipar a todos los agentes fronterizos de CBP con cámaras corporales, y pudo obtener la aprobación de una directiva que requeriría que ICE informara al Congreso sobre el estado de su plan piloto de cámaras corporales, por lo que puede equipar a sus oficiales con cámaras en poco tiempo.

Ley de Reunificación Familiar – H.R. 3312

En 1994, el Congreso autorizó un nuevo programa temporal que permitía a los inmigrantes indocumentados que de todos modos eran elegibles para visas a través de relaciones familiares o destrezas laborales convertirse en residentes permanentes legales sin tener que regresar a su país de origen. El programa, conocido como “Sección 245 (i)” por su ubicación en la Ley de Inmigración y Nacionalidad (INA), proporcionó una vía importante hacia la legalización para aquellos con vínculos con los Estados Unidos que pudieran pasar una verificación de antecedentes penales. Esta vía hacia el estatus legal se volvió aún más importante después de que el Congreso promulgó la Ley de Reforma de Inmigración Ilegal y Ley de Responsabilidad Inmigratoria, implementando prohibiciones de retorno de tres y 10 años para aquellos que estaban presentes ilegalmente en los Estados Unidos, al permitir que los solicitantes elegibles eludan esas prohibiciones onerosas.
La Sección 245 (i) disfrutó del apoyo bipartidista y su fecha límite de solicitud se extendió varias veces a lo largo de la década de 1990 y principios de la de 2000 con votaciones bipartidistas en ambas cámaras. Sin embargo, el Congreso no ha extendido este programa desde que cerró en 2002. Esto dejó a millones de solicitantes elegibles sin un camino hacia un estatus legal que no los separara de sus familias. Algunas estimaciones sitúan el número de beneficiarios potenciales actuales del programa en aproximadamente 4 millones.

El Rep. Espaillat introdujo la Ley de Reunificación Familiar para reabrir este camino crítico hacia el estatus legal, protegiendo a los inmigrantes de las prohibiciones de retorno excesivamente punitivas de tres y diez años, al eliminar la fecha límite de solicitud promulgada originalmente. El proyecto de ley de Espaillat también protegería de los procedimientos de deportación a cualquier persona que tenga una solicitud de visa de inmigrante pendiente o que esté esperando en una larga fila para que se emita una visa. Esta medida finalmente brindará certeza a innumerables familias inmigrantes respetuosas de la ley.

January 18, 2021
﻿
Welcome to the 117th Congress

These last two weeks have been some of the most challenging, memorable, and rewarding days of my life. On January 3, 2021, I swore an oath before God to defend the Constitution and serve the incredible people of TX-11.

The twenty-nine counties of this remarkable district are home to the most decent, honest, hard-working men and women who feed, clothe, and power this nation. I could not be more appreciative of the trust you have placed in me, and am determined to work hard every day to be your voice and advocate in Washington.

Read on to see some of the work I have been doing in Congress on your behalf.

￼
￼

Introduced Legislation to Safeguard our Oil and Gas Industry 

On my third day in office, I became the first freshman Member of the 117th Congress to introduce a piece of legislation. The bill is called the Saving America’s Energy Future Act. It aims to protect oil and gas jobs by prohibiting the incoming Biden administration from barring fracking on federal lands. 

The Permian Basin is the largest oil producing region in the United States. It produces over 40% of our nation’s energy and is home to over 200,000 jobs directly supported by the industry. This is clean, affordable, reliable energy that powers our nation, heats our homes, and allows us to defend ourselves. Energy security is national security, and nothing could be more important. 

This is why my first action in Congress was to implement safeguards against anti-energy Democrats who create radical, destructive policies such as the Green New Deal. So far, the bill is supported by over a dozen co-sponsors.

Hosting My First Telephone Town Hall

Last week, I hosted a telephone town hall, where I called out to 60,000 constituents across the 29 counties in the 11th District. It was extremely helpful to speak with some of you directly and hear your thoughts and concerns. 

I am humbled to receive your feedback, whether positive or negative, so that I can better serve you and represent your voice. 

I look forward to hosting Town Halls in person as soon as possible. Please keep an eye on my website or Facebook page for future event details. 

Supporting Important Legislation 

Throughout my first two weeks in Congress, I supported numerous bills that further the best interests of the 11th District and our entire Nation.

Save Democracy Act 
(Sponsored by Rep. Jim Banks-IN) 
Makes targeted reforms to the federal election system, providing Americans with confidence in our elections by addressing key failures in our electoral system including voter registration, ballot casting, and ballot counting. Americans deserve to know that their legal votes will not be nullified by illegal ones.

Balanced Budget Amendment 
(Sponsored by Rep. Steve Chabot-OH) 
Proposes an Amendment to the Constitution requiring Congress to balance our budget. The U.S. is over 26 trillion dollars in debt—and counting. This is totally unsustainable and will have disastrous consequences for our economy and the future of our country. The federal government should be accountable just like every local and state organization to not spend outside its means. 

Keep the Nine Amendment 
(Sponsored by Rep. Dusty Johnson-SD) 
An Amendment to the Constitution mandating that the Supreme Court remain at nine Justices. Despite numerous highly polarized attempts to change the size of the Supreme Court, it has remained at nine justices for over 150 years. Since the confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, radical Democrats have vowed to pack the Supreme Court with liberal justices to fundamentally alter the trajectory of the Court. Now more than ever, the Supreme Court needs protection from increasing partisan attacks. 

Protecting Life in Crisis Act 
(Sponsored by Rep. Brian Babin-TX) 
Prohibits funds meant for federal COVID-19 response from going towards abortions or abortion coverage.

Title X Abortion Prohibition Act 
(Sponsored by Rep. Virginia Foxx-NC) 
Prevents the Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) from providing federal family planning grants or funds to entities that perform abortions. While federal statute currently prevents taxpayer dollars from being used ""in programs where abortion is a method of family planning,"" these programs can nevertheless share the same facility, staff, and waiting room as facilities performing abortions. As a result, in spite of performing hundreds of thousands of abortions every year, organizations like Planned Parenthood can still receive tens of millions of dollars in taxpayer money annually.

DC-Maryland Reunion Act 
(Sponsored by Rep. Dusty Johnson-SD) 
This bill provides a common-sense solution to the Democrats' push for statehood for Washington, D.C. Instead of completely thwarting the intent of the Founders by making our Nation's Capital City its own state, this bill grants the majority of the landmass in Washington, D.C. back to its original jurisdiction in the state of Maryland. Only the National Capitol Service Area, consisting solely of the Capitol, National Mall, White House, and federal buildings would remain the “District of Columbia.”

Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act 
(Sponsored by Rep Ann Wagner-MO and Rep. Steve Scalise-LA) 
This legislation requires medical professionals to provide immediate care for children who survive abortion procedures, and would allow those who do not provide care to face criminal charges. It also gives the mother of the abortion survivor a civil cause of action and protection from prosecution.

Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act 
(Sponsored by Rep. Richard Hudson-NC) 
Will allow those with concealed handgun licenses reciprocity in other states that also allow concealed carry firearms—similar to a drivers’ license that is valid across multiple state lines. 

No Taxpayer Funds for Abortions Act 
(Sponsored by Rep. Chris Smith-NJ) 
This bill makes the Hyde Amendment and other current abortion funding prohibitions permanent and ensures that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) faithfully conforms to the Hyde Amendment.

Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act 
(Sponsored by Rep. Chris Smith-NJ) 
The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act amends the US Code to prohibit any person from performing an abortion on an unborn child who is 20 weeks or older. 

Sending Letters Addressing Prominent Issues 

I have also signed on to several letters addressing election security, preventing taxpayer dollars from going towards funding abortions, and supporting the Port of Houston, which acts as a major oil and gas transference for Texas, benefiting our district by supporting our oil and gas workers and bringing prosperity to our great district. 

America is Exceptional, Impeachment Only Further Divides

The events of the past week have left many of us feeling hurt, confused and horrified. Like many of the good, hard-working, honest folks in the 11th District of Texas, I am disappointed in the outcome of the 2020 election, but sickened by the radical mob that descended on the U.S. Capitol to carry out vandalism and violence, resulting in the deaths of at least five Americans—including U.S. Capitol Police Officers.

As I have said repeatedly in the past, I unequivocally condemn all acts of violence. We need to take a deep breath and think about how we move this country forward. 

Impeachment is not the answer.

Dear Friend, 
As we celebrate MLK Day and honor the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., I cannot help but think of his Letter from a Birmingham Jail, in which Dr. King wrote: 
""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny."" 
In the wake of recent events in our nation’s capital and around our communities, Dr. King’s words ring as true as ever. 
Earlier this month, we saw the shameful desecration of the United States Capitol, the undermining of American Democracy, and the deaths of six Americans—fueled at least in part by extremist and white nationalist views. Months before that, we witnessed the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery, among so many other Black Americans who lost their lives as a result of prejudice and discrimination. And for nearly a year now, we’ve seen as the COVID-19 crisis has taken a disproportionate health and economic toll on Black Americans and Black-owned businesses alike. 
I think we can all agree that our nation is in desperate need of the kind of justice Dr. King spent his life advocating – that’s why I remain committed to addressing injustice through action. 
In the 116th Congress, I introduced the Justice in Policing Act with Sens. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris, and now that Democrats have regained control of the Senate, I’m going to keep fighting to get this legislation passed and onto the President’s desk. You can also bet that I’ll be working with the incoming administration to ensure timely and equal access to the COVID-19 vaccine. 
Lastly, I believe there need to be consequences – not just for those who infiltrated our Capitol, but for President Trump, who helped foment the insurrection with his inflammatory rhetoric and blatant lies about the election. 
Now more than ever, we must work to protect our democracy for the future and live up to the ideals that Dr. King set forth with his words and his activism. 
You can count on me to keep working to help Virginians get through this tough time, together. If you want to share your thoughts about an issue that’s important to you, you can send me an email any time using the form on my Senate website. You can also follow me on Facebook and Twitter. I look forward to hearing from you. 
Sincerely,

Congresswoman Beatty Celebrates the Life and Legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
January 18th, 2021, is Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, our nation’s annual observance reflecting on and recognizing the life and everlasting legacy of Civil Rights icon Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. To mark the occasion, U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03), Chair of the powerful Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), issued the following statement:
“'What are you doing for others?’ That is what Dr. King said was life’s most persistent and urgent question. Throughout his entire life, Dr. King answered this question by working tirelessly to make our nation more just and equitable, as well as more civil, hospitable, and kind. That is what we must remember on this Day of Service: that we cannot simply lie down and hope for change—because today is not a ‘day off’ but rather a ‘day on.’ With that in mind, I encourage my constituents and all Americans to do their part and answer Dr. King’s call to action by making a difference in their neighborhood, serving our community, and continue fighting for a world  where people are judged not by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character.”  To find out how you can be a difference maker, visit www.nationalservice.gov, and be sure to join the conversation online by using #MLKDay.

1/18/21 10:21,His lasting example,"￼
January 18, 2021
Dear Friend,
It would be all too easy to let the violent attacks and dangerous threats against our democracy dominate all of our thoughts. On this Martin Luther King Day, however, I would urge us to pause for a moment to reflect on the continuing resonance of Dr. King's sacrifice and service to our nation. We should remember that his lasting example continues to inspire countless Americans to this day.
Last year, we lost one of Dr. King's contemporaries in the Civil Rights Movement, a lifelong champion of our democracy, and my former colleague, Congressman John Lewis. When he was a young student, Lewis was inspired by Dr. King's call to put everything on the line--including his own life--to advance equality and opportunity for all Americans. He kept getting into what he called ‘Good Trouble' to advance our country until his final days.
Following Martin Luther King and John Lewis's example, over the last year, a new generation of Americans chanted loudly in the streets and then marched to the polls to demand that our elected leaders finally confront our nation's deep-seated and systemic injustices. Black Lives Matter demonstrators focused our attention on the insidious ways that racist discrimination contributes not only to deadly encounters with law enforcement but also to heartbreaking and unacceptable disparities in health, education, and economic outcomes.
There is incredible sorrow, hurt, and righteous anger in our country today. So much work remains to bring about all of the changes that we seek. But the seemingly impossible is actually possible when we engage in our democracy. This idea might best be embodied in the fact that I will soon be joined in the United States Senate by Senator-elect Raphael Warnock, the senior pastor of Dr. King's Ebenezer Baptist Church.
In his life, Dr. King demonstrated how to actively participate in the bending of the moral arc of the universe toward justice. We all have a role to play in the months and years ahead to heal our country and rebuild our communities in ways that move us closer to Dr. King's dream.
Sincerely,
￼

Wicker: Big Tech Has Crossed a Red Line 
Wave of Censorship Confirms Need to Confront Tech Monopolies 
This month, powerful tech companies took unprecedented steps to censor free speech. In the days after the deadly Capitol Hill riot, Facebook suspended President Trump’s account, saying it posed a “risk of further violence.” Twitter went a step further and permanently banned the President’s account, along with 70,000 others they described as a security risk. Snapchat also closed the President’s account while platforms like Reddit and Twitch began limiting Trump-related content. In addition, Parler, a platform popular among conservatives, was forced offline after Apple, Google, and Amazon removed the platform from their app stores and withdrew support services. 
This tidal wave of censorship crosses a serious threshold. Conservatives have long complained about censorship on social media, but these companies have never gone this far. Their actions drew sharp criticism from our European allies, the President of Mexico, and even the liberal ACLU, who recognize this could lead to further suppression of speech. I am concerned these acts of censorship will set a dangerous trend that could threaten free speech and divide our nation further. 
The Internet Is the Public Square 
In the internet’s early days, most online discussions were confined to chatrooms and blogs. These forums made up a very small part of the “public square,” which had been dominated by local newspapers, television, and our personal interactions. If censorship ever occurred online, it did not affect most of our lives. 
More than 20 years later, the situation has changed dramatically. The internet is now a major center for public discourse, and the public square now includes the vast terrain of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other platforms. Because so much of our discourse now takes place online, platforms have an obligation to promote and protect our tradition of free speech. Tech companies are increasingly failing at this, and their recent actions against the President and thousands of users represent a new low. 
Tech Monopolies Must Be Challenged 
These acts of censorship would not be so consequential if tech giants had real competition. Unfortunately, they do not. An elite handful of giant tech companies now dominates the marketplace beyond anyone’s wildest imagination. Their footprint in our society is so massive and their resources so vast that they can snuff out any small competitor, like Parler, that threatens their hold on the market. This monopolistic behavior, coupled with the worsening restrictions on free speech, calls for congressional action. 
Last year, I convened the heads of three major tech companies – Facebook, Twitter, and Google – for a hearing that addressed online bias and censorship. Senators had the opportunity to grill these CEOs and discuss potential changes to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects online platforms from being sued over content posted by users. I have drafted legislation that would modify Section 230 to give platforms strong incentives to protect free speech. I will introduce this legislation soon as the lead Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee. 
Congress should go further and take a serious look at anti-trust issues surrounding these tech firms. I am encouraged that the House and Senate Judiciary Committees have already begun doing this. Tech companies who take collective action against competitors, like Parler, need to know that they are playing with fire and positioning themselves for trust-busting. We must fight to promote competition in the technology sector so that our nation can benefit from the best ideas new innovators have to offer.

1/18/21 8:32,Dr. King’s Beloved Community,"￼
Dear Friend,
 
Today, communities across our nation will come together – albeit a little differently this year – to celebrate the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
 
But it’s impossible to commemorate today without addressing the immense amount of pain that our nation is in following the attack on the United States Capitol just twelve days ago.
 
By now, I’m sure you have seen the photo of the mask-less man flying the Confederate flag in the Capitol and that witnessing that heinous display of hate infuriated you just as much as it did me. In addition to the fact that this was the first time that traitorous flag had been flown by an insurgent inside the Capitol building – something that couldn’t even be achieved by armies of the Confederacy during the Civil War – the place he carried it is significant as well.
 
He walked the same hallway that’s home to the portrait of Shirley Chisolm, the first Black woman ever elected to Congress, around the corner from the very spot where Abraham Lincoln sat as a member of the House of Representatives, and just down the stairs from where the statues of Rosa Parks and Dr. King stand.
 
This heinous act of hate still makes me sick to my stomach, and it’s a reminder of just how much work remains to achieve what Dr. King so eloquently called the “Beloved Community,” his dream of an America where justice, equality, and love of one another are the basis on which we function as a society.
 
Now, as our community comes together to commemorate Dr. King, our children are watching and looking to us to lead the way, and to do so following his example.
 
That’s why, as we continue his mission, we must do so free from the anger that is often so easy to hold onto. And we must follow the instructions that Dr. King gave to a group of his supporters immediately after his home in Montgomery, Alabama was bombed 65 years ago with his wife and daughter still inside.
 
Just minutes after the explosion, holding his family close and with his house still in flames behind him, he said, “I want you to love our enemies. Be good to them, love them, and let them know you love them.”
 
That is hard, I know. I was tested on my flight home the day after the Capitol attack – surrounded by 100 or so proud protesters calling themselves patriots, high-fiving each other, and chanting, “Stop the steal.”
 
While we must hold those accountable who incited the insurrection at the Capitol, as well as the individuals who took part in it, we must also recognize the opportunity before us to follow Dr. King’s example – to lead with love and compassion, even when there are those who hold us in contempt.
 
I commit to each of you that I will do my best to live Dr. King’s words in this moment and in the difficult days, weeks, and months ahead as we recover from the attack. Knowing that there are so many in our community who share in that commitment gives me hope that we will be able to create Dr. King’s Beloved Community – and that we will do so together.
 
Warm regards,
￼

Dear ,
Today, Martin Luther King Jr. Day, is an opportunity to celebrate and reflect on Dr. King’s words, teachings, and lasting legacy in American history. Dr. King’s commitment to exposing and dismantling our nation’s deep-seeded racism and systemic poverty has greatly influenced generations of civil rights movements. 
His leadership helped drive a movement of grassroots action that challenged racist and discriminatory laws in cities throughout the South. It eventually led to the enactment of federal anti-discrimination legislation, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 1968 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. This work was extremely dangerous and too many, including Dr. King, lost their lives to white supremacist violence.  
North Carolina shares a history with Dr. King. He and his organization, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), held a conference at Shaw University in Raleigh in 1960 after observing the North Carolinian civil rights activists’ effectiveness in staging sit-ins to protest segregation. Following this conference, students formed the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), which organized sit-ins, Freedom Rides, voter registration drives, and other grassroots actions to advance the civil rights movement. 
As Dr. King said, “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice”. Today, this message holds particular significance as the work of the civil rights movement remains unfinished. This summer, his words were repeated nationwide as millions demonstrated to demand justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Rayshard Brooks, David McAtee, and countless other Black Americans who have been killed in acts of racist violence.
Let us use today to recognize the racism that has plagued our society since its inception and reflect on the collective work left to be done. We must always keep an eye toward this history as we reflect on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s legacy and continue his work to dismantle systemic racism. As your Member of Congress, I will continue to support legislation that uplifts Black communities in North Carolina and nationwide.
I hope you take time today to honor Dr. King and join in for the MLK Day of Service.
Sincerely, 
￼

Also, please remember to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube for regular updates on how I am serving the people of South Carolina.     Martin Luther King Jr. Day   Every year, it is important that we stop and honor the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. I grew up in a time when our country refused to acknowledge civil rights for all people. My grandfather picked cotton, and my parents were faced with the signs that read “blacks only” and “whites only.” It is in large part because of Dr. King’s efforts that my family was able to go from cotton to Congress.   Dr. King fought for justice and equality in a peaceful and non-violent way, and in return, he was met with jail sentences and violence. He never gave up, he remained hopeful in the face of all of this. Dr. King said, “Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.” While we all come from different walks of life, we can still discuss ideas and differences without tearing each other down.   Dr. King imagined a fair and civil America, an America where a person’s race, gender, and zip code did not dictate future opportunities. I realize that our work towards racial equality is far from over, but Reverend King ensured that we moved towards that equality. My own upbringing, along with Dr. King’s work to combat poverty, were some of the driving principles behind my Opportunity Agenda. My mentor taught me that work is a good thing, but creating opportunities for others is a great thing.   Today, we honor the work he started, the doors that his work opened, and the message he died for. Let us all work together to ensure that Dr. King’s message of hope lives on. 
Sincerely,

Dear Friends,  Ohio has announced plans to move into Phase 1B of its COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan. Tomorrow, individuals 80 years and older will be eligible to receive their first dose of the vaccine. Individuals 75 years and older will be eligible the following Monday. I continue urging Ohioans to learn the facts about the vaccines, talk to their trusted doctors, and protect themselves, their families, and their communities. 
 
Best,

President-elect Joe Biden will be sworn in as the 46th President of the United States after running on a promise of uniting the country. Putting the country through another impeachment process in the last week of the President’s term in office will only further divide us. Public officials across the political spectrum need to collectively lower the temperature of our nation. We would best serve our constituents and the country by ensuring an orderly and peaceful transfer of power, rather than forcing through the House a rushed and inherently political impeachment.
 
Democratic leadership has stated they may delay transmitting the article of impeachment to the Senate for up to 100 days, and the Senate has already stated they cannot take up an impeachment trial until after President-elect Biden has been sworn in. Impeachment is a grave power; it must not be exercised in haste.
 
Investigations into the tragic events of January 6th are still ongoing. The facts of the day have not been fully uncovered. However, it is already clear that many came to Washington, D.C., prepared for violence before any words were spoken at the morning rally. It would be prudent to wait for all of the facts to come to light if we are to properly evaluate the gravity of the situation. If Members of Congress want to build a serious and credible case against President Trump, they should wait until we have a complete, factual understanding of what transpired. Given these concerns and limitations, I cannot support this impeachment that is markedly short of due process.
“In the wake of these events, our nation – all of us – must take a deep breath and do some soul searching. Every individual American needs to take a long look in the mirror and examine what we say, how we say it, and the actions we take.
 
Last Wednesday’s extremely egregious events did not happen in a vacuum. Our country has seen escalating political violence in recent years, and individuals are responsible for the actions they take. Unfortunately, I am no stranger to that political violence, having survived the politically-motivated shooting by a far-left extremist inspired by Bernie Sanders on a baseball field four years ago. I chose then to not – and still do not – hold Senator Sanders responsible.
 
Ultimately, everyone is responsible for their own actions. I said that then, I said that during the riots of the past summer, and I say that again now.
 
Nobody should be encouraging or excusing violent riots of any sort, whether they gripped our cities last summer or infiltrated our Capitol last week. We cannot continue to say things like, ‘You create a crowd. And you push back on them’; ‘you have to go to the streets and be as violent as Antifa, BLM’; and, ‘People do what they do.’ Our words matter, and we cannot give encouragement or acceptance of violent behavior.
“President Trump’s actions and words during the violence last Wednesday were inappropriate. He failed to quickly and unequivocally condemn the violence wrought upon the Capitol, which was bravely defended by our selfless Capitol Police Officers. Today, the President’s legacy is already entrenched in the minds of every American, as is the legacy of all those who have called for or committed violence in America.
 
The course we are on will only cause more division rather than the unity we need. I will continue to work toward a more perfect union with peace, prosperity, liberty, and justice for all.

1/17/21 21:07,Weekly Wrap Up,"
￼ 
Dear Neighbor,
Once again, I write at the end of a historic week.  What I witnessed in the United States Capitol on January 6 and in the days since is vitally important for you to know. 
This Wednesday, I returned to the House Gallery, one week to the day that a violent mob surrounded it while I was inside for the certification of the electoral college result.  I was back in the House this week to debate the Article of Impeachment against President Trump for inciting the attack on the Capitol, your elected representatives, and our democratic system that would once have been unthinkable.  
I co-sponsored the article of impeachment against President Trump and voted in favor of this resolution.  It passed the House of Representatives with bipartisan support, 232-197.
During the debate, many members of Congress used their time to explain their reasons for supporting or opposing impeachment of the President.  Sadly, many used their time to make false claims and comparisons, to continue to dispute the outcome of the presidential election, to blame others, and to continue with the dangerous narrative that what happened on January 6 was a peaceful protest.
It was not a peaceful protest.  It was an armed attack, an insurrection of people who sought to disrupt the work of the government through force.  The Washington Post has published a compelling video timeline of the events that took place inside the Capitol.  (I was a part of the group in the House Gallery discussed from around the 9:30- to 13-minute mark in the video.) 
While some present may have been caught up in something other than what they anticipated, make no mistake that organized, armed, and coordinated groups intended to stop the certification of the election results and were prepared to do so through violence.  They stormed the Capitol with tactical gear, weapons, and Confederate battle flags, one of which was paraded through the United States Capitol.  Five people were killed.  Many more injured, most of them brave U.S. Capitol Police officers who engaged in hand-to-hand combat to protect the Congress.
As we continue to learn more about that day, there are many questions to answer.  This week, my colleagues and I have worked to address the failures in intelligence, preparation, and planning that contributed to that tragic day.  We are calling for several investigations:
	•	We are calling for an independent federal investigation by the Government Accountability Office into the security lapses at all levels that allowed the insurrectionists to breach the Capitol;
	•	We are calling on the Department of Defense to answer for the delayed response during last week’s attack; and
	•	We are calling on the Acting House Sergeant at Arms, Acting Senate Sergeant at Arms, and United States Capitol Police to investigate the access given to visitors to the Capitol Complex on Tuesday, January 5, 2021—the day before the attacks on the Capitol.
One thing we know now, however, is that this effort is not over.  You likely know from the news that those who attacked the Capitol on January 6 have vowed to return—perhaps today, perhaps inauguration day, perhaps another day.  This is domestic terrorism.
How we respond—as a Congress and as a people—matters.  And it has to start with telling the truth.  That is why I took to the House floor on Wednesday to condemn the specious and dangerous statements being made by colleagues who sought to diminish the seriousness of the attack on the Capitol or this moment in history.  You can watch my remarks here.
￼

We have enormous and complex challenges before us.  We are dealing with the health and other impacts of a deadly pandemic that has taken the lives of nearly 400,000 Americans and the livelihoods of many more.  I know it is true.  Because I hear every day from people who need help with unemployment benefits, with economic impact payments, with housing assistance.  This pandemic is real.  Its impact on the health of all of us is real.  Its impact on our economy is real.
At the same time, we have been engaged in a vital national conversation about race in this country—our past, our present, and our future.  We have an opportunity to work to heal wounds that are as old as this country itself, and we must do so.  This work, too, takes seriousness and truth.  Seeing the Confederate battle flag flown inside the United States Capitol on January 6, after witnessing alarming increases in overt racism, anti-Semitism, and bigotry across the country in recent years, reinforces the urgency and depth of the work that must be done to root out hate in our country.
How we move forward—to protect and improve the lives and livelihoods of our neighbors, to ensure justice for all, to make our union more perfect—is a great challenge.  It requires serious people to address it.  We need a diversity of ideas and perspectives, but we must start from the same set of facts.  And it must be driven by a commitment to our country and to our Constitution, to the idea of government of, by, and for the people.  That commitment has guided me throughout my time as your representative, and it always will. 
￼
As we face these challenges to our democracy, we continue to face the challenges brought by the COVID-19 pandemic.  This week, Harris County Public Health launched a new website to view COVID case data, testing and vaccine information, and demographic data more easily.  It will be updated daily at 4pm and is downloadable.
On Friday, Houstonians filled up every one of the 2,600 new vaccination appointments offered by the Houston Health Department in 16 minutes.  It will take time before everyone can receive a COVID-19 vaccine, and until then we must continue our efforts to keep ourselves and our loved ones safe.  The positivity rate in Harris County is at 20.3 percent, and we remain at a Severe Threat Level for community spread. 
As you may have seen in the news, the incoming Biden Administration has announced a plan to accelerate vaccine distribution, and has appointed trusted leaders to lead the effort.  You can read more about it here.
Each of us must our part to slow the spread of this virus.  Wearing a mask, keeping physical distance, and washing our hands are the most effective methods to slow the spread.  Getting tested can also help contain the spread.  You can visit covcheck.hctx.net to find your nearest testing site.

 I am glad to report to the small businesses in our community that the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan applications have reopened for first-time borrowers and certain businesses who have already received and used funds.
I will be hosting a webinar with SBA-Houston on Friday, January 29 at 11 AM.  We will help answer questions for this new round of PPP, provide information about the application process, and more. 
You can RSVP here or by clicking the link below to join. 
￼

With this reopening, there are some key changes and additions to the program:
	1.	I ensured that my bill, H.R. 6754, the Protecting the Paycheck Protection Program Act, was included in the passage of the most recent coronavirus package.  It permits normal tax deductions for expenses paid with forgiven PPP loans.  
	2.	This round of funding sets aside $15 billion for first-time borrowers with 10 or fewer employees and for small loans in low-income areas.  
	3.	PPP funds may now be used and forgiven for the purchase of protective equipment, adaptive investments, and software and cloud computing, among other things.   
	4.	501(c)(6) organizations representing business associations may now receive PPP loans. Also, our local newspapers and broadcasters providing us with life-saving information are now eligible for assistance.  
	5.	Loan forgiveness applications have also been simplified for loans under $150,000.  I encourage you to call your lender to determine if this is available to you.
My team is also available to assist with any questions or concerns about the PPP. Call us at (713) 353-8680.
￼
Tomorrow, we will celebrate the life and legacy of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. with a national day of service inspired by the courageous leader who saw what could be and worked to make it so, the man who reminded us: “Life’s most persistent and urgent question is ‘What are you doing for others?’”  On Wednesday, we will inaugurate our 46th President.  It is a week of that reminds us all of who we are, who we can be, and what we can do when we work together.  I look forward to working with the Biden administration and with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address the urgent challenges and opportunities before us.  Despite the events of recent days, I remain hopeful that we can make real and meaningful progress.  
I am proud to represent you, and I am here to help you.  Please do not hesitate to call me to share your thoughts and concerns or to let me know how my team and I can help.  You can email here, or call my office at (713) 353-8680 any time.


Best wishes,

INCITEMENT OF INSURRECTION

I couldn’t imagine what would prompt me to pursue another impeachment of Donald Trump. And then a violent mob attacked one of the most sacred symbols of our democracy, the U.S. Capitol, intent on destruction and harm.  

Even with only a few days left of the Trump presidency, we must always ensure our President will preserve, protect and defend the U.S. Constitution, as is required of the oath of office. President Trump has shown he will not and cannot be trusted to uphold his oath. He has damaged the Constitution and damaged America. Each and every one of us has a responsibility to reduce the continued threats of violence on fellow Americans and ensure the government transitions peacefully. Therefore, I solemnly voted once again to impeach Donald Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors, specifically “incitement of insurrection”.

To read more about my views on the events of the last week or so, I encourage you to read my piece published here in the Colorado Sun.

COVID IN COLORADO

RECENT COVID RELIEF: On December 21st, Congress passed the sixth major COVID relief package, H.R. 133, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act. Here's a rundown of a few of the items that might impact you and your family:

• Economic Impact Payments - The package provided an additional round of Economic Impact Payments of $600 for individuals making up to $75,000 per year and $1,200 for couples making up to $150,000 per year, as well as a $600 payment for each child dependent. This means a family of four could receive $2,400 in direct payments. It also expanded these direct payments to mixed-status households, which is retroactive to the CARES Act. Click here for frequently asked questions and more information.

• Unemployment Assistance - This bill provided an additional $300 per week for all workers receiving unemployment benefits, through March 14, 2021. This bill also extends the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program, with expanded coverage to the self-employed, gig workers, and others in non-traditional employment, and the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) program, which provides additional weeks of federally-funded unemployment benefits to individuals who exhaust their regular state benefits. However, the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE) will need to receive guidance from the U.S. Department of Labor before issuing the newly enacted benefits and it could take several weeks before claimants receive benefits.

• Rental and Mortgage Assistance - The CDC's national eviction moratorium has been extended until January 31, 2021.

• Paycheck Protection Program / EIDL - On January 11th, the SBA began a staggered reopening of the Paycheck Protection Program. Only small community financial institutions are able to submit PPP loan applications to the SBA, followed by all authorized lenders. Second-draw loans will be available to small businesses and non-profits with 300 or fewer employees and can demonstrate a 25% reduction in gross receipts between comparable quarters in 2019 and 2020. For more information about the Paycheck Protection Program, visit SBA.gov.

VACCINE DISTRIBUTION IN COLORADO: The supply of the COVID-19 in Colorado remains limited, and vaccinations will be prioritized for high-risk health care workers and Coloradans most at risk for severe cases of COVID-19. The general public should not expect to receive the vaccine until summer 2021. To get the facts on the COVID-19 vaccine and to see when and where you can expect to receive a vaccine, please visit CDPHE’s website at covid19.colorado.gov/vaccine or call the CO-HELP hotline at 303-389-1687.

LEVEL ORANGE: Jefferson County and Adams County are currently in Level Orange, according to Colorado's COVID-19 dial.

If you have questions or need help accessing COVID-related benefits, please call my office at (303) 274-7944.


GOOD NEWS REPORT: SPECIALIST CHO

In Washington D.C. this week, while I was purchasing coffee for a group of National Guard members from New Jersey, I got to talking with a few National Guard members from Delaware and learned about Specialist Cho who had to miss his citizenship ceremony because he had been deployed to the U.S. Capitol.

I immediately went to work to get him sworn in as a U.S. citizen as soon as possible and I'm proud he was able to do so today. I’m glad I could play a small role in helping one of our men in uniform become a citizen of the country he’s currently helping to defend and protect. I never thought I’d see this type of deployment to the U.S. Capitol but I greatly appreciate the service of the men and women who have come to Washington D.C. to ensure a peaceful transition of government, including Specialist Cho.

￼

And a big thank you to Senator Coons of Delaware, Delaware Governor Carney, and Rep. Lofgren of California who helped make this happen so quickly.


ARTEMIS ASTRONAUT AND COLORADO NATIVE DISCUSSES MISSION TO MOON

This week, I hosted a discussion with NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine and Artemis Astronaut Matthew Dominick as students of the 7th Congressional District asked them questions about the Artemis mission, NASA priorities and much more. 

On the virtual town hall, Dominick, a native of Wheat Ridge, Colorado, shared his journey of graduating from high school in Golden, Colorado to becoming an astronaut and what he is looking forward to most about the Artemis missions. Administrator Bridenstine weighed in with what NASA has accomplished during his time leading the agency and the missions ahead for NASA.

DC Briefing: Week of January 11
 
Dear friends,
 
There has been much debate in recent days about where Republican loyalties lie – to a President, a President-elect, or to our political aspirations.  We must place our loyalty with our country and the Constitution. The United States is not and should not be defined by any one person in the Oval Office or any political party agendas.  We are Americans based on the ideals of freedom and equality under the law, that is embodied in our Constitution and Bill of Rights.  Our freedoms and our humanity are what unite us as a nation and defending our Constitution ultimately preserves our freedoms and protects our humanity.  
 
I have had to make several important votes these past few weeks: certification of electoral college votes; a resolution urging Vice-President Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment; and an impeachment. For all three, I relied on our Constitution, God’s guidance, and the truth as God enabled me to see:
 
	•	I voted to certify the electoral college vote because I do not believe that Congress has the constitutional authority to overturn a state’s certified electoral college vote unless under narrowly prescribed circumstances.  No evidence of fraud was submitted for review during House proceedings that would have indicated they should not be certified. Our duties under the 12th Amendment are clearly defined.
	•	I opposed the Speakers effort to invoke the 25th Amendment. The intent of section 4 of the 25th Amendment is for the Vice President and the Cabinet to have a legal avenue to remove the President if he is unable to fulfill his duties; not for Congress to direct the removal of the President.
	•	I opposed impeachment.  Section 4 of Article II of the Constitution specifically references removal from office as a consequence of an impeachment conviction, it therefore follows that one must actually be in office to be tried and convicted on impeachable offenses.  There was not enough time to conduct a trial before January 20, which is when the President-elect will be sworn in and a peaceful transfer of power will occur.  Moreover, while impeachment is often cited as a political process, that does not mean we should abandon the traditions of due process.  In this case, due process was thrown out the window to fulfill a political agenda and to rush the impeachment process. No hearings were held; no evidence or witnesses were presented for review, and the President was not given the chance to defend himself. 
 
Following the mob attack on January 6 at our nation’s Capitol, the President committed to an orderly transition of power. It should have been much earlier. But now, we have an opportunity to come together and move our country forward as we begin a new session and welcome a new Administration into the White House. We should seek to heal and reconciliation, not further exacerbate our partisan divisions. 
 
What happened at the Capitol was reprehensible, and I send my deepest condolences to those who lost their lives. I condemn the rioters who broke into the Capitol, assaulted police, vandalized the House and Senate, and led an attempt to stop one of our most sacred constitutional processes. They do not represent the Republican party nor the values of our great Republic. We demand those involved be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
 
We must always protect peaceful protest, and thousands and thousands choose to do so on a regular basis. But violence against fellow citizens cannot be justified.
 
--Don Bacon

Congressman McHenry Weekly Update 


Voting Against Democrats' Article of Impeachment


On Wednesday, I voted against House Democrats’ Article of Impeachment against President Trump. While I wish that President Trump would have more forcefully condemned the violent actions of the mob that invaded the Capitol on January 6th, there are a variety of reasons—both practical and otherwise—why I voted against impeachment. Practically, doing this less than a week before President-elect Biden takes the oath is simply absurd. Furthermore, if the removal of President Trump is so urgent—as my Democrat colleagues claim—why did the House wait a full week after the events to have this vote? 

While this transfer of power has not been peaceful, it is still moving forward. I believe we must focus on ensuring that happens, as our Constitution and our laws demand. Click here or on the image below to read my full statement on Wednesday's vote.

Supporting Small Businesses



This week, the Small Business Administration reopened the Paycheck Protection Program, an essential lifeline for small businesses that have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. The PPP will help provide additional support to the backbone of our economy, small businesses like those in the Tenth District, so they can stay open and support workers, families, and our communities. Click here or on the image below to learn more about how to apply for support from the Paycheck Protection Program.

Stay Up to Date



It is the start of a new Congress and a new year and I am looking forward to serving you: the people of North Carolina's Tenth District. If you'd like to stay up to date on what is happening here in the Tenth District and in Washington, D.C. or learn more about the organizations, businesses, and people I have the honor of serving as your Representative, please follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

What I Have Been Reading



U.S. bans imports of all cotton, tomato products from China's Xinjiang region

Reuters 

On Wednesday, the Trump Administration banned all cotton imports from the Xinjiang region of China. I applaud this move as a strong stand against the Chinese Communist Party and the horrific forced labor practices in Xinjiang. We must continue to combat the malign actions of the Chinese government and their predatory practices that hurt American businesses—like North Carolina’s textile industry—and American workers.

Friends,   As I write this, it’s hard to believe that the world reached a grim milestone this week in the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic: more than two million people have now died from this virus. Here in the U.S., the heartbreak continues as cases rise, and families mourn.   A year ago, none of us imagined anything like this was possible. Too many across New Jersey have lost a loved one. Families are struggling to pay bills. Small businesses have been forced to shutter permanently.   And on top of that, our country is now reeling from the violent attack on our U.S. Capitol last week.    While things may seem bleak, thankfully, help is on the way with the Biden-Harris Administration.   Keep reading to find out what’s been happening this week. 
 

￼
ONE: We’re closer than ever to building the new Portal North Bridge
After many doubted we could succeed, this week, we secured $823 million in federal funding to help build a new Portal North Bridge. With this funding, we can ensure safe and reliable service on Amtrak’s Northeast Corridor, and some day soon, NJ Transit commuters will no longer have to waste countless hours waiting on a century-old bridge to close. Plus, this investment in our infrastructure will create good paying jobs.
 
￼ 
TWO: Honoring Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick
Officer Brian Sicknick represented the best of New Jersey and America. When a mob invaded the Capitol, he gave his life to protect our democracy and the lives of hundreds of members of Congress, countless Capitol staff and the Vice President. On Tuesday, I joined Officer Sicknick’s friends and family in South River to lower the flag in honor of Brian’s sacrifice for our nation, and it was my sincere honor to present his wonderful family with an American flag that had flown over the Capitol. 
 
￼
THREE: Biden-Harris Inauguration
Despite the seditious attack on the Capitol nearly two weeks ago, American democracy prevailed. Next week we will celebrate the swearing-in of a new administration. In the coming months, I look forward to working with President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to deliver real results and provide additional COVID-19 relief to families in New Jersey and all across America. 
 
Make sure to follow me on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook to stay up to date on what’s happening in New Jersey and in the Capitol.   Sincerely,   ￼  Senator Bob Menendez

Dear Friend,

A little over a week ago, the entire nation watched in horror as our United States Capitol Building came under attack. The same day that a mob entered the Capitol to disrupt our Constitutional obligation, Members of Congress resumed our work. Both Republicans and Democrats quickly came forward to denounce the violence, but that unity was short-lived.

We need to ensure a riot like what occurred never happens again, and I’ve called on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to create a bipartisan commission to investigate these attacks. Only through a careful review of the facts can we ensure the seat of our nation’s democracy is safe and secure...KEEP READING HERE

WHAT'S GREAT IN THE 8TH 

￼

Exciting things are in store for Southern Missouri this new year. For example, the all-inclusive playground that I have closely followed and strongly supported is planned to be installed in Farmington in the coming months. Thanks to the fundraising efforts of Play It Forward in the Parkland, children with and without disabilities will have a fun and safe place to play.

￼

Tiffany Armes, a psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner, made it her mission to raise money to buy robotic pets to provide, comfort, and companionship to help nursing home residents combat loneliness and isolation. Inspired by her mother and determined to give back- Tiffany brought joy to residents at Stockhoff Memorial Nursing Home in Fredericktown.

￼

An 8-month effort in Charleston to combat food insecurity resulted in the delivery of over 300 tons of food to over 3,000 residents through the USDA’s Farmers to Families Food Box program. The program quickly formed into one the largest community partnerships in Mississippi County. Thank you to all who participated for such a successful fight against hunger.

￼

Jackson High School senior Elijah Jones has been selected as one of the top 300 student scientists by Society for Science in the Regeneron Science Talent Search 2021. He is working on a low-cost method to synthesize two unique drug components. If successful, vital drugs for cancer to HIV, that are cost-prohibitive, would be able to be mass produced. Congratulations Elijah! Talent like yours is part of what makes Southern Missouri great.

￼

Congratulations to Trey Riley from the St. James FFA chapter for being named the winner of the 2021 Missouri Cattle Industry FFA Public Speaking Contest! I remember my days as an FFA member fondly and appreciate the lessons of responsibility, leadership, and the value in hard work that it teaches the young adults of Southern Missouri.




 IN CASE YOU MISSED IT

I joined Newsmax TV's ""The Chris Salcedo Show"" to discuss the troubling censorship of conservative voices by Big Tech. It's time for Democrats to realize that without a bipartisan stand for the protection of our rights- we will all soon be silenced.

Peak Democratic Hypocrisy: Call for Unity, Then Impeach
I stood by our Constitution and voted NO on Wednesday's article of impeachment.

Discussing the Democrats' Renewed Impeachment Push
 The Left has a short memory when it's convenient, but America doesn't.

We remember the violence inflicted by BLM and radical anarchists in 2020 just like we remember how Democrats and the liberal media labeled the acts as “mostly peaceful” and REFUSED to condemn them.

The hypocrisy never ends.

Reacting to the Second House Impeachment Vote

Congress must act immediately and do what it should have done long ago – reform Section 230.

Democrats jump to condemn violence now because it fits into their agenda.

What about the looted/burned businesses, cities destroyed, and innocent people beaten/killed by far-left extremists in 2020?

Facts Matter
Well color me surprised: not everyone who rioted in the Capitol was a Trump supporter.

How about we wait for the facts before saying things like “pro-Trump mob” and blindly blaming Republicans?

FACTS MATTER – even if Democrats and the liberal media pretend they don’t.

This Week's Impeachment Was Purely Political
This impeachment is purely about political posturing and a catchy CNN headline – it’s a disgrace.

Our 240-plus years of proud history and those who died to ensure America was victorious through its many trials deserve better than the mockery that unfolded before us this week in Congress.
￼
Democrats Are Now Silent on Breaking Up Big Tech
Democrats used to be supportive of breaking up Big Tech but now, are silent. Why? Could it be because the censorship benefits them?

No matter your political party – this authoritarian-style rule ends well for no one. We must reject it.

The Left Continues to Defend the Violence Committed by BLM, Anarchists, and Antifa
Not a single Republican in Congress condones the vile acts we witnessed in the Capitol last week. 

Democrats, however, CONTINUE to defend the violent riots committed by BLM/anarchists/Antifa in 2020 that injured/killed Americans and wreaked havoc on our cities.

CONGRESSWOMAN MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR'S UPDATE

Hello and welcome to my weekly newsletter. Although I started a few days later than my colleagues due to my COVID diagnosis, I immediately hit the ground running. I was sworn in, I took my first votes, and I introduced my very first ball all within less than 24 hours! 

It truly is the honor of a lifetime to serve YOU in Congress!

I WAS SWORN-IN 
AS A MEMBER OF THE 117TH CONGRESS
￼

As a little girl, I never would have thought I'd come to represent the very same community that welcomed my parents with open arms, 60 years ago, when they fled Communist Cuba.

I was sworn-in by Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) alongside my beautiful daughters, Nicoletta and Martina. It's definitely a moment I will cherish forever.

My commitment, is with you, the residents of beautiful South Florida and I am committed to fighting tirelessly to deliver the best results for our community. 
￼

On the evening of January 12th I was sworn-in on the House Floor by the Speaker of the House alongside my colleague Congressman David Valadao (R-CA) after recovering from COVID-19.

WE INTRODUCED 
THE FORCE ACT WITHIN 24 HOURS OF BEING SWORN-IN
￼

I was honored to introduce hmu very 1st bill, the FORCE Act, within 24 hours of being sworn-in.

The State Department recently placed the Castro regime on the List of State Sponsors of Terrorism for harboring fugitives of the American justice system, refusing to extradite ELN terrorists to Colombia, and engaging in terrorist activities in Venezuela and Nicaragua.

I'm incredibly humbled by the outpouring of support by my colleagues Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart(R-FL), Congressman Carlos A. Gimenez(R-FL), Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY), Congressman Alex Mooney (R-WV), Congressman Neal Dunn, M.D.(R-FL), Representative Michael Waltz (R-FL), Congresswoman Stephanie Bice (R-OK), Congresswoman Kat Cammack (R-FL), Congressman Scott Franklin (R-FL), and Congresswoman Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon (R-PR) who have co-sponsored the FORCE Act that holds the brutal Castro regime accountable & forces the regime to comply with existing U.S. Law ahead of any attempt to remove them from the List of State Sponsors of Terrorism.

1/17/21 10:15,"My Thoughts on Impeachment, Vaccination for Seniors, and Financial Assistance","
 
 
 

January 17, 2021
 

Dear Neighbor, 

Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to call or write to me over the past few days to share their feelings on the sensitive topic of impeachment. I understand many of you feel passionately about this issue.  I released this statement to explain my thoughts on the subject. As I explained in my last newsletter, I was appalled by the violence at the Capitol, the senseless loss of life and destruction of public property that ensued. I am also concerned about reports of more planned attacks in Washington and around the country.  Violence is NEVER justified.  

I have not agreed with many things the President has done and said over the past few weeks. However, the Speaker's politically-motivated impeachment will continue to divide Americans. It further alienates millions of Americans who distrust our political processes, have concerns about the direction of our country and feel that their voices are being silenced. It will only fuel the anger and frustration that already exists.  We need to find common ground and focus on the real challenges that families across our nation are experiencing.  

Aside from this being a counterproductive measure as we try to unite our nation, this reckless action sets a very dangerous precedent for our country. The House voting to impeach the President without listening to eyewitness testimony or reviewing a single piece of evidence is a violation of due process and a significant, undemocratic deviation from past procedures.  Removing a duly elected President from office is a very serious proposition. I am genuinely concerned that this action will make it easier for future leaders to circumvent the will of the people and remove a future President without cause. In October of 2019, Speaker Pelosi herself issued a letter “establishing the procedures for impeachment hearings that were open to the American people, authorizing the disclosure of deposition transcripts, outlining the transfer of evidence to respective committees and setting forth due process rights for the President and his counsel.” Yet, as she rushed to make history in impeaching President Trump for a second time she failed to even give the pretense of creating an impartial process. 

The real work of Congress is not wrapped-up in the headline-dominating stories of the hour, but rather is the business of solving the every-day problems Americans are facing. The long-term success of our country is dependent on our willingness to work together as one team for the greater good. That is my focus as we move forward.  

Continue reading for an overview of important developments that have transpired over the past week. 

Vaccinating Seniors

As your federal representative, my role in the vaccination process has been to facilitate the development, approval and production of a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. Based on the principle of federalism and in accordance with the law, each state was responsible for developing and implementing a vaccine distribution plan to meet the targeted needs of prioritized population groups. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) provided guidance to states about which groups it felt should be prioritized in tier one of plans (healthcare workers, those in long-term care facilities and seniors over the age of 65) however, each state had the discretion to develop its plan based on the individual needs of its citizenry. 

I know that vaccination roll-out in our state has been challenging for many, and I have worked closely with state and local officials to share the feedback I’ve received from my constituents. I will continue to do so. I can say that Florida’s distribution plan is a work in progress and that the state continues to improve and expand its efforts. As noted in this article, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department announced some recommended changes last week. As long as we ensure that seniors who have already received their first dose have no delays obtaining their second dose, I am cautiously optimistic about these announced changes. I do believe that pharmacies and community health centers can help expand the number of people who are able to get vaccinated, especially in Florida. I know demand is high among seniors and those with pre-existing health conditions, and I will keep working with state and local leaders to expedite and enhance the processes being used. 

As Florida developed its distribution plan, it prioritized seniors-both those in long-term care facilities and in the general population. To date, more than 350,000 seniors in Florida have been vaccinated. While this is a higher percentage of vaccines going to seniors than in other states, we must do more to ensure all seniors have access to a vaccine. I’m continuing to work with state and local leaders to achieve this goal. 
 

New Developments Last Week

Two local hospital chains began to vaccinate seniors who get their primary healthcare through their networks. AdventHealth started with patients who have a primary care physician with AdventHealth Medical Group and are 65 or older. Each of the eligible providers and patients in this group will receive an email from AdventHealth with information on how to register. Vaccines will be administered at three locations in Carrollwood, Clearwater and Zephyrhills, until supply runs out. Appointments are required. There is no out-of-pocket cost for receiving the vaccine. 

Baycare Medical Group (BMG) also began offering the vaccine to patients who receive their primary care through the Baycare Medical System. Due to the limited supply of vaccines, invitations to schedule vaccine appointments are being issued to patients 65 and older on a rolling basis. As capacity is available, BMG will notify patients who meet criteria on a randomized basis via email or text message. Recipients of the invitations will need to schedule an appointment to be seen at a designated location.   Again, I’m continuing to work with state and local leaders to expand opportunities for seniors to get vaccinated through pharmacies and community health centers. I am also advocating for local health departments to receive more doses of the vaccine as quickly as possible. 

The Pasco County Health Department has a new way to pre-register for #COVID19 vaccine. Register so you're ready when new appointment slots open. This is a much more efficient system with the capacity to improve vaccine distribution and alleviate significant frustration for those seeking an appointment.  Also, many people have asked about vaccine availability in East Pasco. The county has just announced a new drive-thru vaccination site at St. Leo University. The county will only be accepting registered patients with an appointment at all vaccine locations, and at this time slots are reserved for seniors over the age of 65.   

Pinellas County will also be using a new registration system for vaccine distribution and expects to receive more doses next week. Click here to learn more. 
 

Fighting for Our Heroes

The K2 Veteran featured in this heartbreaking story is absolutely right-we must hold up our end of the end of the bargain. While I remain hopeful that the draft Executive Order will still be signed, I will never stop fighting for these heroes until they receive the care and benefits they deserve.  
 

Additionally, the delays Veterans have faced in trying to obtain copies of their records are unacceptable. I’m glad to see the VA finally working on an expedited pathway that will allow Veterans to access the benefits they deserve.  
 

Providing Relief to Small Businesses

I know many local small businesses are in desperate need of relief. Last week the Small Business Administration re-opened the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to provide vital assistance to those small businesses who are struggling. Businesses who have never received a first loan may apply and small businesses who suffered significant financial loss during the pandemic may now begin applying for a second PPP loan today. Businesses apply for these largely forgivable loans directly through their lenders. Click here to learn more information about this valuable program. 
 
 

Offering Direct Relief to Americans Impacted by the Pandemic 

The Department of Economic Opportunity (DEO) has provided new federal unemployment benefits ($300.00 per week) for nearly 1 million claimants who had NOT previously exhausted their federal benefits before December 26, 2020. The Department is continuing to work through more claimants who fall into this category. 

However, the DEO is still working to process the new federal unemployment benefits for individuals who exhausted their eligible benefits under the CARES Act prior to December 26th. The Department says it is making the necessary program adjustments to its computer system and hopes to be able to provide these benefits to this group soon (no specific date has been given yet).  The Department advises that all claimants should check their CONNECT portal every 48 hours for updates.  Additionally, the Department of Economic Opportunity is continuing to process requests to backdate effective dates for the original benefits provided under the CARES Act. No anticipated completion date has been announced. 
 
 

The IRS has also issued the vast majority of second stimulus payments to eligible Americans. Many constituents have reached out with concerns that the IRS Get My Payment Tool shows their stimulus check being deposited into an account they don’t recognize. In many cases this has occurred because of a confusion with temporary accounts created by tax preparation companies. In these instances, stimulus checks are now being routed to appropriate accounts. Click here to learn more.  
 
 

Protecting Consumers

It is absolutely unacceptable that Amazon, Google, and others have forced Parler out of competition. This is the very definition of Monopoly power, and it is part of a larger problem. Social media giants and Big Tech should not have the arbitrary power to silence the voices of millions of Americans. I rarely find myself on the same side of an argument as the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) but in this instance I couldn’t agree more; censorship by Big Tech is a dangerous precedent that threatens viewpoint equality on the Internet. The need to reform Section 230 has never been more clear. I call on my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee to address this important issue.
 
 

Raising Awareness

Did you know that January is National Bath Safety Month? Each year thousands of people of all ages visit the emergency room because of injuries suffered in the bathroom. Here are some important safety tips to help keep you and your loved ones safe.

 
 
 

Constituent Corner

I recently received this message from a constituent who my staff helped with an unemployment case. 

When the pandemic first hit and I had to file in April 2020, it took so long to get my unemployment. It didn't come through until your hard working crew reached out, got my information and reached out to DEO. Thank you again for those efforts as it helped me so much! I had two kids suddenly out of school and found myself laid off. It was nice that despite what the left thinks of Republicans, one was trying to help me get state benefits desperately needed for my family. Keep it up Gus! Your amazing!

This is just one example of the work we do each day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!

Sincerely,
 

Gus Bilirakis
Member of Congress

IMPEACHMENT

Since President Trump was elected, Democrats have been pushing their divisive impeachment narrative and it is no surprise they held impeachment proceedings this week. If Washington Democrats were truly interested in reconciliation after the terrible events we witnessed last week, they would focus on it. Instead, they are focused on impeachment in the closing days of President Trump’s presidency. 

In this episode of Buddy's Briefing, we discuss impeachment, honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and more.

Next, I meet with a local hotel owner to discuss potential legislation to address trivial lawsuits in the industry.  After a phone interview with the Press Sentinel in Jesup to discuss the pending impeachment of President Donald J. Trump, I have a virtual meeting with Goldman Sachs to learn more about their 10,000 Small Businesses Voices, a program to help entrepreneurs create jobs and economic opportunity by providing access to education, capital and business support services.  My final meeting of the day is a GOP conference virtual meeting where we discuss the schedule and agenda for this week.

Tuesday, January 12, 2021:  It’s always a pleasure to join my good friends Butch Hubbard and Bob Morgan on the world famous Butch and Bob show on WIFO in Jesup and this morning I share with them my experiences from last week and the pending impeachment vote in Congress.  Next, I participate in a U.S. International Trade Commission (USITC) hearing on the Section 201 investigation regarding fresh, frozen or chilled blueberries.  The hearing is being held in order for the Commission to determine whether blueberries are being imported from foreign countries in such increased quantities that they are potentially a substantial cause of serious injury or threat of serious injury to the U.S. blueberry industry.  Later in the day, I have a phone interview with the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) to discuss the work of the Select Committee on the Climate that I serve on and afterwards I head to the airport for my trip to Washington.  Once in my office, I have a GOP member conference call where we hear from Committee on House Administration ranking member Rodney Davis (R-IL), the Acting Chief of Capitol Police and leaders from the Sergeant at Arms office who provide us with a security update for the Capitol.  Next, I head to the House Chamber where we have our first vote series around 7:30 and I return around 11:00 for our second vote series. 

Wednesday, January 13, 2021:  After our daily all-staff conference call, I head to the House Chamber where I have the opportunity to speak on the article of impeachment that we will be voting on today.  A link to my speech can be found here. 
￼

Afterwards, I remain in the House Chamber as we have our first vote of the day.  Once back in my office, I have on-camera interviews with Cox/CMG and Nexstar to discuss the pending impeachment vote. Later, I join in on a bipartisan member briefing on security for the Inaugural ceremony led by the National Security Special Event lead agencies including the U.S. Secret Service and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).  Next, I have a virtual interview with Gray TV to discuss the impeachment vote, followed by a virtual interview with WJCL TV in Savannah to discuss legislation I have passed dealing with scams and finally with WXIA TV in Atlanta to discuss the impeachment vote.  A link to my interviews can be found here, here and here.  Afterwards, I head to the House Chamber where we have our second vote on the article of impeachment that the Democrats have put forth and for the second time and with less than a week left in his term, the Democratic party has passed articles of impeachment on President Donald J. Trump.  

Thursday, January 14, 2021:  After a late night flight back home last night, I’m up early and on Skidaway Island in Savannah as I am honored to be the guest speaker at the Skidaway Island Kiwanis Club meeting and bring them up to date on the last few weeks in Washington.  Afterwards, I head to our Savannah office where I meet with a veteran from Richmond Hill in Bryan County who has recently retired from the Army after many years of service. 
￼
Rep. Carter speaks at the Skidaway Island Kiwanis Club meeting
Next, I have a virtual call with a soldier currently stationed in Korea to discuss an issue that our office has been assisting him with.  After our daily all-staff conference call, I meet with a veteran from Savannah to discuss an issue our office has been assisting him with before meeting with a constituent from Skidaway Island to hear about the good work a group she has recently started has been doing.  Next, I head to the Second African Church in downtown Savannah where I film this week’s edition of Buddy’s Briefings before joining in on a telebriefing with representatives from Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),  to bring members up to date on Operation Warp Speed (OWS).  Afterwards, I have a virtual interview with Fox 28 in Savannah to discuss local news coverage. 

Friday, January 15, 2021:  I have the opportunity today to participate in a taped interview along with my colleague Rep. Al Lawson (D-FL), on “This Week in Jacksonville” on WJXT in Jacksonville, where we discuss this week’s impeachment vote in Washington and the events leading up to it.  The program is set to air this Sunday morning at 9:00 a.m.

Weekly Newsletter: January 13, 2021

Politicizing Impeachment

Last week’s violent attack on the U.S. Capitol was abhorrent, and I condemn every unlawful action that occurred. Every single person who participated deserves to be prosecuted. The intimidating acts against Capitol Police, other law enforcement, and congressional Members and staff, including bomb threats, have no place in a free and functioning Republic. I grieve for our nation and the Capitol Police and others who lost their lives and are still recovering as a result of the riot.
 
Information regarding last week’s attack is still forthcoming. Investigations are only beginning and there is much we do not yet know. Capitol Police leadership and other law enforcement agencies owe Congress and the American people answers. However, we do know the FBI office in Virginia has made clear that they had communicated potential premeditated threats to D.C. and the Capitol ahead of the January 6th rally. 
 
It is fair to say that the expectations for what could be accomplished in terms of certifying the election on January 6th were inflated beyond what was reasonable — especially concerning the constitutional authorities of the Vice President in counting the electoral college vote. But the President was clear that day in saying ""I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.""
 
One year ago, over my objection, Congress took what was considered a once-in-a-generation vote to impeach a president. That vote followed a hyper-politicized effort that had begun before he was even elected. Sadly, under current Democratic leadership, impeachment has become a politicized tool — part of the cancel culture movement of the left to silence dissent. With only one week until Inauguration Day, it is not in the best interest of the nation to move forward in this way. And with only one week since the tragic events of January 6th, it is not being done with the rigorous examination, debate, and due process such an extraordinary measure mandates. 
 
During this time I have thought a lot about Ronald Reagan’s remarks that ""freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.""
 
As a nation, we are in need of healing and restoration. We need a return to honest dialogue and debate over political issues. Trading 280 character barbs will not lead to better policy for the American people nor the understanding that leads to healthy communities and families. I am firmly committed to standing strong for the conservative constitutional principles that have guided this great American experiment in self-governance — and opposing the doctrines that would seek to undermine free people. How we go about those debates is important and says a lot about who we are as a people. And while we work toward that more perfect union, it will do us well to remember Benjamin Franklin’s admonishment from Scripture to us that ""unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain."" May God bless you and have mercy on our nation.

Calling Out the Hypocrisy of Big Tech
￼
￼
￼
￼
Our country is in a dangerous place when the social media companies that colluded to suppress news about the election are now limiting free speech. The deceptive algorithms and censoring is unacceptable. I question the motives of companies that permit the Chinese Communist Party to freely post but limit Americans. I believe it is hypocritical and inconsistent, which is why Congress needs to focus on this bipartisan issue in the 117th Congress. I spoke with Crossroads about this topic. You can watch the full interview HERE. As a result of Big Tech's censorship, I recently joined Gab and Parler. Follow me @RepCloudTX.

Reintroducing the Improving Confidence in Veterans' Care Act
￼
￼
￼
￼
You may remember that I first introduced a bill to improve the quality of healthcare that veterans receive from the Veterans Healthcare Administration in June 2019. I just reintroduced it into the 117th Congress and will press for it to be signed into law. The Improving Confidence in Veterans’ Care Act will help foster veterans’ confidence specifically in VA physicians.  

A report found that some Veterans Health Administration facilities had hired unqualified doctors who had lost their medical licenses, some for reasons like patient neglect or other serious offenses. The main reason unlicensed doctors were permitted to practice was because VHA employees were not properly trained on the resources available to check the status of these licenses. I reintroduced my bill to correct this oversight and help improve veterans’ confidence in VA physicians. Unqualified doctors should not be providing care for our veterans, and my bill would make sure that any doctor whose license has been taken away or suspended would not be allowed to practice medicine for the VA.

Our nation owes it to our veterans to deliver on the promises we made to them - because exceptional Americans like our veterans deserve exceptional healthcare.

Moving Our Nation Forward

Friends,
 
The last two weeks have been a trying time in our country. It’s time to get down to business and do the job you sent me here to do: keeping Parris Island open, protecting taxpayers, guarding our Lowcountry’s natural beauty by caring for our environment, and empowering families to freely live their lives.
 
In the first 10 days of my time in Congress, I faced tough votes and a tougher reality: our discourse has driven division and violence that has cost lives. I’ve been outspoken about the inciteful rhetoric we’ve seen from elected officials and how we got here.
 
You sent me to Congress to be your independent voice and I intend to be. I will always be hard-charging toward solutions that deliver for the Lowcountry. 
 
The only way to stop the cycle of hatred is if we take a thorough look at how we got here using facts and reason, not threats and vengeance. Our leaders must understand they can’t use toxic rhetoric, which raises the stakes of every political disagreement to apocalyptic levels without consequences.  
 
We must focus squarely on the people’s business. 
 
To the people of the Lowcountry, that means I will work to ensure you keep your hard-earned money, veterans get the support they deserve, I will work to ensure Parris Island continues to train great Marines, and that you, not the government, are empowered to pursue your happiness.  
 
There’s a lot to be done here in South Carolina and in Washington. I’m going to be part of the solution to our problems, and I’m going to try my best to help break the cycle of partisan animosity in Washington. That’s who I am, that’s who you elected, that’s who I will be. 
 
Sadly, this week, Democrats forced a rushed impeachment through the House in response to the events of January 6th. The violence we witnessed was absolutely horrific and everyone whose actions incited that violence must be held accountable. In seeking to stop the division inherent in our current politics, we must stand up to hopeless political maneuvers that offer no remedy to the problems facing our Republic. A tree is known by its fruit, and this effort will bear nothing but further conflict and division. 

Being your voice in Congress is the honor of my lifetime. When I dropped out of high school all those years ago, I never thought I'd be here in Washington speaking for the Lowcountry and all the people who call it home. I appreciate the trust you've all put in me, and I will do everything in my power to reward that trust with real results that will preserve our freedoms and make our lives better.
 
Sincerely, 
 
Congresswoman Nancy Mace

1/16/21 14:53,The Blackburn Report: Honoring Martin Luther King Jr.’s Legacy,"￼
THE BLACKBURN REPORT  January 16, 2021 
  
PREPARING FOR INAUGURATION 
Our nation is currently preparing for the peaceful transition of power that will occur on January 20 during the Inauguration of the new President and Vice President of the United States. The swearing-in ceremony is an essential tradition in American democracy and its historical significance cannot be overstated. To read more about the 59th Inaugural ceremony and its history, click here. 
 HONORING MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.'S LEGACY 
This upcoming week, we will honor the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. The Reverend was a fearless leader in the civil rights movement, and his work still inspires new generations of leaders. During this time, I encourage all of us to read his powerful “I Have a Dream” address that captivated the nation nearly sixty years ago. A portion of the historic address is included below: 
I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.   I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.”   I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.   I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice.   I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today.   I have a dream that one day down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of “interposition” and “nullification”, one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today.   I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together. 
  
SUPPORTING SMALL BUSINESSES

Impeachment
 
This week, I voted against an intemperate attempt to impeach President Donald Trump. Once again, House Democrats, many of whom are my friends, took to the House floor to claim that the riots in Washington, DC last week were explicitly caused by President Trump. Some of the rhetoric they point to was typical political hyperbole and nothing that I have ever seen cause a riot.
 
One thing that amazed me was the degree to which House Democrats do not realize why President Trump is so popular. Only he stepped up and dealt with the crisis at the border when so many other politicians did nothing. Only he stepped up and fought to bring our manufacturing jobs back from China after others watched them leave. And he has been a leading voice against ‘cancel culture,’ where billionaire technology company CEOs feel they have the right to say who is protected by the first amendment.
 
I was particularly disappointed that several people on the Democratic side of the aisle attributed racism to the Trump phenomenon. I know many people in my district who support and contribute to President Trump and know none of them to be racists.
 
Hopefully, Congress can now get on to dealing with the important issues of the day, including fighting ‘cancel culture,’ ending the COVID-19 outbreak, improving our broken health care system and securing our borders.
  
 
Cancel Culture
 
As you have probably seen on the news, hundreds and perhaps thousands of Americans have been silenced for saying things that don’t conform to the worldview of a handful of big technology company CEOs. This censorship is deeply concerning, as these technology companies are, in essence, deciding who is protected by the first amendment.
 
Of particular concern is the censorship of President Trump and former Congressman Ron Paul. These leaders, and everyone who has been wrongfully silenced, should have their voice restored by these companies immediately.
 
I expected Democrats to overreach on their authority when the party aligned themselves with Black Lives Matter, an organization founded by self-proclaimed Marxists that has also praised the work of Communists. I never dreamed, however, that it would be this quick and this extreme.
 
As a practical matter, the decision to ban someone from social media platforms is to deny them the ability to share their ideas. I hope freedom-loving people from all parts of the political spectrum rise-up and demand a restoration of free speech.
 
I commend Chancellor Angela Merkel, President Andrés Manuel Lopez Obrador, Alexei Navalny and the French officials who have spoken out against this censorship, for their courage to denounce this outright effort to undermine Americans’ right to the freedom of expression and the horrible precedent it will set to have companies deny individuals of their constitutionally protected rights.
  
 
Economic Impact Payments
 
Recently, President Trump signed an additional COVID-19 relief bill into law that included $600 Economic Impact Payments (EIP). Millions of Americans have already received payment through direct deposit into their bank account. If you have not received this payment through direct deposit, please watch you mailbox carefully, as you may be receiving payment through the mail by way of either a check or a prepaid debit card. 
 
The prepaid debit card, called the Economic Impact Payment card, is sponsored by the Bureau of the Fiscal Service and is issued by Treasury’s financial agent, MetaBank®, N.A. More information about these cards is available at EIPcard.com.
 
EIP Cards are being sent in a white envelope that prominently displays the U.S. Department of the Treasury seal. The EIP Card has the Visa name on the front of the Card and the issuing bank name, MetaBank®, N.A. on the back of the card. Each mailing will include instructions on how to securely activate and use the EIP Card.

Dear Lindsey,

﻿I voted to impeach President Donald Trump for inciting a violent and deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. I took this solemn action in accordance with the oath I swore to support and defend our Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.

Watch my floor speech here. 
￼

President Trump has shown himself to be a clear and present danger to our Republic, our Constitution, and the rule of law. By inciting a violent insurrection and failing to use his influence to put a stop to his supporters’ seditious efforts, he has violated his oath to the Constitution. Congress has a responsibility to hold him accountable for his unlawful actions and for his repeated attempts to subvert the will of the people and impede the peaceful transition of power. 

I urge the Senate to take immediate action, begin a trial, and vote to convict President Trump. He should not hold the most powerful office in the world for one more minute, and he should be barred from public office forever. He is toxic to our democracy, and only we, the Congress, can prevent him from doing future damage. It would be irresponsible for those of us who can do something, to do nothing.

Feel free to stay in touch on these, and any other issues you care about or if you have further concerns. If you would like to receive periodic updates on issues affecting the Inland Empire please follow me on Twitter, Medium, “like” my Facebook page, and sign up for my newsletter.

PPP 2.0
￼
 The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) 2.0 is up and running! This program is a lifeline for small businesses who have been impacted by the pandemic, including more than 66,000 Oklahoma small businesses. Last year, the original PPP saved more than 50 million jobs across the country.
 
Loans will be available until March 31, 2021 or until the money runs out, whichever is sooner. You can apply through any existing SBA 7(a) lender or through any federally insured depository institution, federally insured credit union, and Farm Credit System institution that is participating. Other regulated lenders will be available to make these loans once they are approved and enrolled in the program. You should consult with your local lender as to whether it is participating in the program.

 Last week’s attack on the U.S. Capitol was a horrific, dark day for our country. While we saw the worst in some, we also saw the best in others.

Weekly Update | January 16, 2021

Why I Voted No On Impeachment

We are at a perilous moment in our Nation’s history. President Trump, many of his allies in Congress, and media commentators on the right deserve blame for the circumstances that led up to one of the worst days this great country has ever seen. Since November, many in my party perpetuated the lie that the election was “stolen” and gave false hope to millions that the president could somehow remain in office after January 20th. That was never going to happen. There must be accountability for leaders who deliberately misled the public, but I fear that without thoughtful and clear-eyed leadership from both sides of the aisle, we are in danger of further violence and political unrest. 

While a convenient talking point, we must be honest that our country did not arrive at this moment in the last two months, or simply the last four years. Though many prefer not to admit it, political deception is a bipartisan disease that seems only to worsen and lead to violence. Last Wednesday is the second time in my short Congressional career that I’ve needed to thank law enforcement for saving my life during an act of political violence. The former because a deranged gunman believed leaders and agitators on the left that I and my Republican colleagues were a danger to America. We as a country have got to do better.

There must be a full accounting of what happened leading up to and on the day of January 6th. Law enforcement must have all resources necessary to bring the perpetrators to justice. That investigation should be unimpeded and free from partisan influence. The investigation should be conducted in such a manner to sooth tensions and provide the public with confidence that law and order will prevail. 

Process matters. A snap impeachment conducted without a full investigation or without due process for the president accomplishes nothing. At a time when political tensions are at an all-time high, impeachment will drive people further into their corners and could lead to additional violence. Unlike what some Democratic leaders are saying, President Trump will not be removed from office under this process. The Democrats’ stated goal to punish the president and bar him from seeking federal office in the future certainly isn’t urgent. He will be removed from office under the law in less than one week. We need to lower temperatures, not enflame them. If, when a full accounting of the facts of January 6th comes in, Pelosi and the Democrats wish to punish President Trump, they can pursue that process with their party’s total control of the legislative and executive branches of the federal government. 

Our nation needs sober-minded leaders who will sooth a wounded electorate. President-elect Biden has missed an opportunity to act on his promise of unifying the country by calling for calm and pledging to listen to those who feel so ignored by our elected leaders. He is now the face of his party and will be the legitimately elected leader of our country in a matter days. I stand ready to work with President-elect Biden on solutions to the many problems our country faces. We should all wish President Biden success, for when he succeeds, our nation succeeds.

Political Violence of Any Kind is Unacceptable

The rioting and violence I saw and heard at the Capitol last week brought back painful memories of the Congressional baseball shooting in Virginia a few short years ago. Political violence of any kind is never acceptable and must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. It’s unpatriotic and un-American. Political leaders, from Congress to the White House, have an obligation to be voices of reason and calming in times of national crisis. That time is now.

The peaceful transfer of power is a bedrock principle of American democracy. Members of Congress must uphold our oaths to the Constitution, do our jobs, and resume the process of governing our great Nation. I want to thank the men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police and others in the law enforcement community who put their lives on the line every single day to keep us safe. They have an extremely difficult and dangerous job. Please pray for them and their families and pray for our great Nation.

Constituent Service Update

This week I was glad to be able to visit with Mr. Kunde's Current Events students at Monticello High School. I always enjoy the opportunity to be able to answer questions from some of my youngest constituents about what's going on in Washington. There was no shortage of topics to cover. It was also nice to see the school's newly renovated auditorium which will improve the student experience there for generations to come.

""The road to space goes through South Mississippi!"" 
-Congressman Steven Palazzo
 
￼
  
Stennis Space Center located in Hancock County is the world's largest rocket engine test stand
 
If you're in or around Hancock county today, you might hear and feel the shake, rattle, and roar of Aerojet Rocketdyne's RS-25 rocket engines being tested at Stennis Space Center. At approximately 4 p.m. CST today, South Mississippians will be certifying the vehicle that will launch the first woman and next man to the moon in 2024.
 
After months and series of tests, the hardworking men and women at Stennis will not only ensure safety when firing off the world's largest rocket engines for eight minutes; they will also be checking the propellant tanks, computer systems, flight safety, as well as power and data. 
 
Space travel is the future. It’s no longer just a technological advancement, but it is a strategic national security move. We know our adversaries are competing with us to be the top competitor in space, and I have every intention of winning this race just as we’ve done in years past. This test is a critical step in NASA's mission to return Americans to the moon by 2024 and further American dominance in the space domain.
 
As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, which authorizes funds for the federal government, including NASA initiatives, I believe it is important for NASA to have a healthy and robust budget to maintain operations. We should continue looking at ways to modernize rockets and invest in more efficient research tools and equipment. I also think the United States has been extremely successful in public-private partnerships. With greater funding, we can continue to harness the power of these partnerships and cement our leadership in space exploration.
 
I’ve always enjoyed learning about space and deep space exploration. Knowing that our friends and neighbors in South Mississippi are contributing to these national efforts makes me immensely proud. 
 
￼
  
The four RS-25 rocket engines being tested today
 
Since the Apollo missions, we’ve been called on to test these powerful engines over and over again. I think the trust and relationship we’ve been able to establish through the years between South Mississippi and those defining our space missions is a testament to our people's reliability. You will find some of America’s hardest-working people right here in South Mississippians at Stennis Space Center.  
 
How To Watch Click here to watch the entire hot fire test on NASA.gov beginning at 3:30 p.m. CST today.
 
I look forward to the long-term results and research produced through future space travel and take satisfaction in knowing how south Mississippi made these ideas a reality.
 
In your service,

Congressman Smith's E-news: January 16, 2021  

Choosing to Come Together

The events of last Wednesday were nothing short of horrific. I am appalled at what I saw and fully support the prosecution of every participant and planner of the uprising. Snap impeachment, however, without a complete investigation sets a dangerous precedent. The impeachment vote may feel politically expedient to Democrats, but this is not the correct way to address the violence nor will it bring our country together. Instead we should be moving forward to work on the key challenges our country faces. I remain committed to building on our accomplishments from the past four years, which had given us one of the strongest economies in American history prior to COVID-19, as we safely reopen and rebuild.

Over the last four years, we have made unprecedented progress on trade. We updated our trade relationships and trade agreements at an historic pace – securing updated comprehensive agreements with Canada, Mexico, and South Korea; entering into Phase One agreements with China and Japan; and removing trade barriers in several other countries. We need to do more to open even greater opportunities to sell abroad as we rebuild our economy. Now is not the time to retrench or view trade agreements as leverage for unrelated and divisive issues. I will use my position on the Ways and Means Committee to keep our momentum going by addressing China and completing trade agreements with United Kingdom and Kenya.

In 2017, we enacted historic tax reform, but we still need to make permanent the tax relief for families and small businesses from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The original version of tax reform we moved out of the Ways and Means Committee included permanence, but Democrats were unwilling to provide the needed support to get that done in the final version. I will continue to encourage my colleagues on Ways and Means to provide this certainty for the American people.

The Ways and Means Committee also has an important role to play as we continue improving rural access to health care. The pandemic has shown how valuable telehealth can be in safely connecting patients and their providers while eliminating the need to travel long distances. I hope we can continue reducing barriers to those services. At the end of last year, language from my bill – the Rural Health Clinic Modernization Act – was signed into law. This language improves Rural Health Clinic payments and represents the first payment update for RHCs since 1988, which will help the 4,100 RHCs nationwide continue to provide essential primary care and preventative services in rural and underserved areas, either independently or affiliated with a hospital with fewer than 50 beds. There are still technical corrections from this bill which would need to be addressed and I will continue my work to improve rural health care.

America is the greatest country on earth. Although we find our country divided, I have the utmost confidence we will find a way to heal. As President Lincoln once said, “a house divided against itself cannot stand.” Let’s choose to come together, debate the issues, and move our country forward. 

Homestead National Historical Park

I was pleased this week when President Trump signed my bill into law to rename the Homestead National Monument  in Gage County, Nebraska, as Homestead National Historical Park. Places like the Homestead National Historical Park bring American history alive and allow us a look into our past. Renaming this facility to more accurately reflect this location gives a clearer picture of the opportunities and hands-on learning experience available. 
 
Our state has a rich history and learning about it has never been easier thanks to innovative projects such as this one. I thank everyone involved in this effort, particularly Friends of Homestead, Congressman Fortenberry for drafting the first version of this bill when Homestead was located in the First District, and Senator Sasse for his efforts to move this through the Senate. Nebraskans are rightfully proud of our role in settling the great plains, and I look forward to seeing the future success of this National Historical Park.

 Impeachment Vote
       The past few weeks have been some of the most difficult weeks in American history as we struggle through great division and the devastating violence against our democracy. I understand emotions are high, and we all desperately want to see those responsible for the events on January 6 held accountable and punished to the fullest extent of the law. However, my colleagues’ decision to impeach President Trump a second time not only stirs up more vitriolic rhetoric across the nation but it also short circuits the process of a serious criminal investigation by the House of Representatives, setting a dangerous precedent that could lead to widespread abuse by both parties. Impeachment is one of the most powerful tools the House has at its disposal, and it should never be used without a thorough investigation into the charges at hand. For this reason, I did not vote to support the Articles of Impeachment brought to the House floor this week.
       There has also been much discussion on the use of the 25th Amendment, and Tuesday, the House voted to call on Vice President Pence to convene with the Cabinet and invoke the 25th Amendment to remove President Trump from office. I also voted against this resolution. Section 4 of the 25th Amendment permits the Vice President with the support of the majority of the principal of the executive departments to make a written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office, making the Vice President the immediate Acting President. Much like Impeachment, invoking the 25th Amendment is a deeply significant tool that should be used at the discretion of the Vice President and the Cabinet. For the sake of preserving the separation of powers in our government, the Legislature should not determine whether this is the appropriate action of the Executive to take. 
        In order to hold the individuals accountable who were responsible for the violent riot at the Capitol, I strongly support immediately appointing a bipartisan commission to investigate all of the events of that day. It is only through a rigorous investigation that we can seek full justice for those who attacked our democracy and threatened the lives of Members, their staffs, U.S. Capitol Police officers, and the employees of the Capitol. We must hold these criminals accountable, but we must do so in a way that protects and preserves our Constitution. 
Update on the Economic Impact Payments
If you are eligible for the $1,200 Economic Impact Payment under the CARES Act of 2020 but never received the payment, you will be able to claim this payment on your 2020 tax return. The second round of Economic Impact Payments worth $600 were distributed January 1st – January 15th, 2021. If you are eligible for this payment and did not receive it during that window, you will also be able to claim this payment on your 2020 tax return. If you have any further questions regarding your eligibility for the Payments or how to claim them on your 2020 tax return, you can find more information at IRS.gov.

CNN's Jake Tapper blasted for questioning disabled veteran GOP rep's patriotism for opposing impeachment

Tapper, who has prided himself on his support of the troops and veterans, was met with fierce condemnation on social media and critics urging him to apologize.
""Representative Mast, along with myself and many others in Congress and across the country, served in the military so Americans can have freedom of speech, regardless of how repulsive or disgusting it may be,"" reacted Rep. Rick Crawford, R-Ark., who is also a veteran.  Talk Business & Politics President Trump historically impeached a second time; Arkansas delegation opposes move  Trump was previously impeached in December 2019 for his efforts to influence the Presidential election but was acquitted in the U.S. Senate. The two articles of impeachment at that time accused Trump of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress for his behavior in the controversy surrounding military aid to Ukraine and relations with the new Ukranian President, Volodymyr Zelensky.  Arkansas Democrat-Gazette State's delegates vote against impeaching Trump  In a written statement, U.S. Rep. Rick Crawford, R-Arkansas, also criticized the swiftness of the impeachment, saying that ""rushing and short-circuiting the process of a serious criminal investigation by the House of Representatives would be a risky precedent that could lead to widespread abuse by both parties.""

1/16/21 8:56,"Living up to the Legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr.","￼ 

January 16, 2021 
Dear Marylanders, 
Each year on Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, we celebrate the life and legacy of the civil rights icon who changed our nation. The fight he led for justice and social equality for Black Americans made our nation a more equal place for all and his legacy laid the blueprint for generations to continue organizing for social change. While it’s important to use this day to say, “look at how far we’ve come,” we must reckon with the ways our society is still fractured with the same wounds Dr. King marched to heal.  
Dr. King’s movement did not end with his death, and neither did the hate or division that he fought against. The reason his words and his message carry such a weight today is because we’re still working to right our nation’s wrongs and to undo the threads of systemic racism. Today’s world carries vestiges of Dr. King’s activism and the forces he marched, organized, and led a movement against, and we can’t ignore them.  
We have watched for years as Donald Trump tapped into a well of hate, bigotry and racism flowing underground and drew them to the surface. In doing so, he has created a safe place for individuals to spew hate without retribution. He said there were “very fine people, on both sides” in Charlottesville, where white supremacists countered peaceful protesters with anti-Semitic and racist aggression. There is a clear thread between this event and the insurrection at the Capitol just 10 days ago, where the rioters kicked down the doors of our Capitol wearing racist and anti-Semitic symbols and waving confederate and Trump flags. 
The contrast in law enforcement’s response to this attack versus the Black Lives Matter protests last summer are a clear reminder of the divisions in our society -  the two worlds that exist and the double standards by which they are policed. Last year we witnessed live on television as the National Guard forced back peaceful protesters to make way for Trump’s photo op, while insurgents invaded the Capitol without apparent consequence.  
Dr. King ushered in change during one of the country’s most tumultuous and violent periods of our nation’s history - and peaceful, non-violent protests were crucial to that mission. He said himself, ""Nonviolence is a powerful and just weapon, which cuts without wounding and ennobles the man who wields it. It is a sword that heals.” In the year 2020, those using his tools met the same language and actions of violence that his movement met decades earlier. 
Honoring Dr. King’s legacy means taking a close look at where we are in the present. It is our duty to continue his work and use the wisdom and the tools he left us to solidify a lasting change. We must always continue to bend the moral arc toward justice.  
In the protests for racial justice, the mobilization of record-numbers of voters, and the work of community leaders and medical workers nationwide to combat COVID-19, we saw the people come together in the face of inequities in our criminal justice, economic, and healthcare systems. We saw the people come together to serve their communities and challenge systemic racism in our nation - this is a part of his legacy as well. 
We now have an opportunity to take meaningful action in government to match these goals with legislation. In just a few days, we will swear in new leadership, President Joe Biden, and our nation’s first Black woman Vice President, Kamala Harris. They bring with them a diverse cabinet selected for their expertise and their dedication to restoring the integrity of our democracy and righting the wrongs of the Trump administration. This historic win will not fix society overnight, but it gives hope that we can keep moving our country progressively forward.  We are entering a time of collective empowerment in which we can work at all levels to achieve all of Dr. King’s goals - to bring social, economic, and legal equality to all Americans, and to cast out the shadows of hate that have stretched across our nation with light and love.  
Martin Luther King, Jr. Day should be a day of action and reflection. We must recommit ourselves and our country to progress and healing. We must carry on the torch for Dr. King’s ideals and ensure that equality, justice and respect for all people are fixtures in our society that will stand firm as long as we all hold them up together. 
Thank you. Please stay safe.

WEEKLY RECAP
The latest news and updates from Congresswoman Beth Van Duyne

January 16, 2021

Dear Friend,

My first two weeks in office have been anything but predictable. I never thought within my first ten days as a Congresswoman I would experience both an attack on the U.S. Capitol and the impeachment of a sitting president. Despite the unexpected, I could not be more grateful for the opportunity to serve as your voice in Washington. 

Over the last week, Americans across the nation have been shocked and horrified after the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol. To be clear: Every American has a First Amendment right to peacefully protest, but violence and anarchy of any kind will never be tolerated. I condemned the violence that occurred across the country over the summer and I condemn it again now. Violence is never the answer. 

I hoped that the events of last Wednesday would result in leaders on both sides of the aisle coming together to mend back the very fabric of our nation. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Instead, members of Congress were rushed back to Washington last week to vote on impeaching a President who will no longer be in office in just a few days. Instead of creating – or even saving – American jobs or negotiating additional COVID relief, the House wasted two days debating and voting on an impeachment that had been preceded by no inquiry, no meaningful debate, and no due process. 

Right now, the American people need us to be better than this. They need us to rise above the heat of the moment to help lift them up, focus on their challenges, and deliver real solutions for them, their children, and our country. Impeaching the President of the United States did not bring us any closer to that goal. On Wednesday, I joined Fox and Friends on Fox News Channel to discuss this and more.

Honoring Capitol Police

Last week, our nation mourned the loss of two U.S. Capitol Police Officers as a result of the attack on our nation’s capital. My heart breaks for the families and loved ones of Officer Howard Liebengood and Officer Brian Sicknick, and for the entire Capitol Police community. We will never forget their service or their sacrifice. 

In the wake of the devastating violence and the death of two Capitol Police Officers, we are installing a wall of support outside of my Washington, DC office to express our appreciation for our brave law enforcement officers. North Texans who would like to join me in offering our condolences to the officers’ families and expressing our support may email their messages to PoliceAppreciationTX24@gmail.com. Out of respect for these heroes and their families, please keep all messages positive and apolitical.

Fighting for Election Integrity

While there are several uncertainties surrounding the 2020 election, one thing is for certain: irregularities and unconstitutional power grabs have led millions of Americans – including many Texans – to question both the integrity and the outcome of the election. That’s why, last week, I led a number of colleagues in sending a letter to the Texas Attorney General applauding his office’s efforts in prosecuting voter fraud and emphasizing the importance of state enforcement efforts to safeguard our elections. Our democratic system was crafted by our Founding Fathers to ensure each and every law-abiding citizen has a constitutional right to vote, a right that Texans take great pride in exercising at the ballot box. Texans should have full confidence that their legal vote counts, and as the newest members of Texas’s congressional delegation, we want to offer our full assistance in helping regain voter trust. To read the full letter, click here.

My First Speech on the House Floor

I came to Congress expecting to engage in vigorous debate with my colleagues to ensure legislation was passed in its best form, and I am ready to legislate with members on both sides of the aisle. But with last week’s new House Rules package, House Democrats made clear they were not interested in bipartisan legislating. On my third day in office, I became the first member of the freshman class to speak on the House Floor when I challenged the new rules package, which forgoes critical pay-as-you-go requirements, paving the way for the Green New Deal and other costly socialist policies, and banned terms like “mother” and “father”, “daughter” and “son”. I believe that, now more than ever, Congress needs to focus on policies that have a meaningful impact on the people, and this rules package will not accomplish that goal.

Paycheck Protection Program Update

The coronavirus pandemic has forced a number of small businesses to close their doors and make tough decisions to protect their workers, their communities, and their very own families. In response to these challenges, Congress has worked side-by-side with the Administration to provide immediate relief to American workers and small businesses. Last spring, Congress created the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which provided hundreds of billions of dollars in emergency relief for small businesses. Since then, more than 28,000 small businesses in North Texas have been able to keep their doors open with the help of PPP loans. 
 
This week, the Small Business Administration (SBA) and the U.S. Treasury Department reopened the PPP loan portal to provide yet another round of assistance to those who need it most. For more information about the PPP, please visit the Small Business Administration’s website by clicking here. The last day to apply for a loan is March 31, 2021. Please do not hesitate to contact my District office if we can be of assistance. We are eager to serve as a resource for you as we all navigate these unprecedented times.

WEEK IN REVIEW 
Dear Friend –    Hearing directly from Iowans in every corner of our state, from our most populated counties to our most rural, is critical to my job. It’s the way I understand their needs and concerns so I can continue to bring Iowans’ voices to Washington and fight on their behalf.

This week, I was excited to kick off my 99 County Tour for 2021 with stops in Warren, Clarke, and Dallas Counties, marking the seventh year in a row I’ve continued my pledge to visit every single one of Iowa’s 99 counties. I’m looking forward to engaging with thousands of Iowans along the way.    Here are some of the other highlights from this week: 

Making ‘Em Squeal  
Hardworking Iowans sent me to Congress to crack down on the federal government’s out of control spending. As part of my efforts to root out Washington’s wasteful spending, I was proud to usher two key government transparency measures into law as part of the annual defense bill.    Both of the bipartisan bills will give taxpayers a clearer picture on where and how their dollars are being spent:  
	•	The Taxpayer Right to Know Act will require a public report card listing every federal program, along with regular updates on the costs and performance outcomes of each.
	•	Aspects of my COST Act were also included in the annual defense bill and requires research and development projects supported by the Department of Defense (DOD) to include a price tag that is easily available for taxpayers.

Promoting Iowa-Grown Biofuel 
I’ve long been calling for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to take action to expand access to higher blends of biofuel, like E15, and to provide more choice at the pump.    A new proposed rule by EPA would help remove barriers to increase sales of E15 by addressing issues with the label at the pump and underground storage tanks. On behalf of Iowa’s biofuel community, I’m glad to see EPA take this step; and, as the saying goes, “better late than never.”

I also joined my colleagues in urging EPA to hold off on issuing numerous pending small refinery exemptions (SREs) – the harmful “gap year” waivers that threaten to undercut the Renewable Fuel Standard.    As a relentless advocate for Iowa farmers and biofuel producers, I’ll never stop fighting tooth and nail to defend their way of life. 

ICYMI: Important Measures for Servicemembers and Veterans Signed Into Law 
As a combat veteran, advocating for our servicemembers and veterans across Iowa and America continues to be one of my top priorities. In the Senate, I’ve been working across the aisle to ensure they have the support and care they deserve, and I’m proud that two bipartisan measures I helped pass were signed into law last week:   
	•	The Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative Act of 2020 permanently establishes the Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative within the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice to protect the rights and legal interests of our servicemembers, veterans, and military families. 
	•	The Department of Energy Veterans’ Health Initiative Act will increase collaboration between the Department of Veterans’ Affairs and Department of Energy to apply innovative, data-driven, approaches to improving health outcomes for our veterans.

What happened at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021 is not the America that I know, that I love, and that I fought for. We are and forever will be the United States of America, and no difference or disagreement is too big for us to overcome.

Representative government is a two-way street, and it requires continued dialogue between elected officials and the people they represent. This week, I kicked off my 41st annual 99 county meetings with ten Q&As with Iowans. 
After nearly two years of fact finding, Ranking Member Ron Wyden and I released the results of our bipartisan investigation into the skyrocketing price of insulin. 
Something is clearly broken when a product like insulin that’s been on the market longer than most people have been alive skyrockets in price. Our investigation worked to get to the bottom of this.

Let's Pass the Biden-Harris COVID Rescue ASAP!
 
 January 16, 2021  
Dear Friends,
While we continue to grapple with the consequence and continued fallout of the January 6 attack on the Capitol, our work to confront the devastating effects of this COVID crisis remains incomplete. On Tuesday, we set another unfathomable record of 4,327 deaths in one day due to COVID, the highest single day record yet. Even more dishearteningly, that was the second time in a week that national COVID deaths exceeded 4,000. Each new day threatens to be among the deadliest in American history, and the numbers are still going in the wrong direction. January is on track to become the deadliest month yet of this pandemic. 
Our nation is also grappling with staggering economic hardships. In the final month of 2020, the economy lost 140,000 jobs in December, the first month with a net loss since April. Last week 1.15 million workers filed for unemployment.
We need action now and a national response that gets vaccines into arms faster and money into the hands of struggling small business owners and everyday Americans. And despite the grim news of the week including grave signs of a worsening pandemic, we also got a promising look at the new rescue plan proposed by President-Elect Joe Biden and his team. 
Here’s what’s included in his $1.9 trillion proposed plan:
	•	$400 billion to strengthen our federal pandemic response including launching a national vaccination program with states and localities that increases investments in testing, tracing and treatment, supports healthcare workers and deliver schools vital resources they need to reopen safely.  
	•	$440 billion to help the hardest-hit small businesses and to protect jobs for essential workers by funding state and local governments, making it possible for them to keep teachers, police officers, firefighters, emergency responders, transit workers and other essential service providers on payroll.  
	•	$1 trillion for immediate direct relief including an additional $1,400 in support for millions of struggling Americans. Unemployed workers will also be eligible to receive up to $400 per week in expanded unemployment insurance payments. And further support will address housing and hunger, expand access to safe reliable childcare and healthcare, increase the minimum wage and more.
We need a lifeline strong enough to pull us out of this dark winter. The Biden-Harris COVID plan gets the job done by facing this pandemic head-on with a bold and comprehensive blueprint for vaccination, resilience and recovery. We cannot afford to drag our feet or fall short in this decisive moment. Congress must get these provisions advanced into law without delay.
There is no denying that we have a long and difficult road ahead. I stand ready to carry forward with this work and make sure we deliver for our families, communities and nation.  
And, as always, thank you for reading.
 
Your friend, ￼

1/15/21 20:59,The Second Impeachment Vote,"
 
￼

 Dear Friend,  
This week, I joined my colleagues in a bipartisan vote to impeach President Trump for inciting a deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol, attempting to disrupt the counting of validly certified electoral results from the 2020 election and endangering the health, safety and security of the American people.  
After the President refused to resign and after Vice President Pence failed to invoke the 25th Amendment, Congress had no choice but to proceed with an article of impeachment to remove Donald Trump from office. 
The U.S. Capitol is a symbol of freedom and democracy -- not just for Americans, but for people around the world. Impeaching President Trump is a declaration to the world that when there is an attack on our democracy -- whether it comes from without or, tragically in this instance, when it comes from within -- we will respond to the threat and we will do what is necessary to defend and strengthen our democracy.  
￼ 


(See here for my remarks on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in support of impeachment.)  
Every moment that Donald Trump remains in office, he presents a grave danger to our country. The Senate must move swiftly to convict the President and protect America.   
Sincerely,  ￼ John P. Sarbanes Maryland's Third Congressional District

1/15/21 20:09,Senator Bennet’s Weekly Update,"A message from Senator Michael Bennet 
￼
Hello everyone,  
It has been a difficult few weeks for our democracy. The president’s incitement of a riot against the U.S. Capitol last week was an egregious abuse of power. As I said on the Senate floor, we are a nation of laws, and not of men. If we don’t reassert that principle in a moment like this, history reminds us how political violence can tear democracies apart. It would be a mistake to think we’re somehow immune.
We must confront this type of political violence to prevent further lawlessness and to preserve our democracy. Congress has already begun to act. Last week, the Senate came together to overwhelmingly reject the anti-democratic efforts to overturn the election. This week, the House voted in a bipartisan way to impeach President Trump. These were important steps toward defending our Constitution and reaffirming the rule of law. 
Now the Senate will have to conduct the impeachment trial even as we transition to a new Biden Administration. I do not think we have to choose between making progress on the Biden Administration’s priorities and holding Donald Trump accountable. In other words, we have to walk and chew gum at the same time, and I’m fully prepared to work around the clock to do that.
If you want to learn more about what else our team has been doing since our last update, I’ve included a few highlights below. 
Stay safe, 
￼  Michael 

FIGHTING FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES 
Last night President-elect Biden introduced a major relief package to support the economy and tackle the pandemic. I was thrilled that it included a proposal based on the American Family Act, a bill I’ve been working on for years to expand the child tax credit and cut child poverty nationwide by 45 percent. In Colorado, the bill would cut taxes for hundreds of thousands of middle-class families, giving them a fighting chance to afford child care, health care, and housing during this difficult period. I look forward to working with President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris to pass it into law. This morning, Stephanie Ruhle and Jared Bernstein, a key economic advisor for President-elect Biden, discussed the impact of this provision for families across the country. You can watch the clip HERE. 
￼ 

FIGHTING TO KEEP SPACE COMMAND IN COLORADO 
On Wednesday, we learned that the Trump Administration is trying to move U.S. Space Command from Colorado to Alabama. I do not believe this decision reflects the best choice, or even a rational choice, for our national security and ability to confront threats in space. I am particularly concerned by rumors that the president influenced this decision for political reasons. 
Colorado is home to an unparalleled combination of military, intelligence, and space assets. We have the industry, the workforce, and the supportive communities. It is why Colorado has been and should remain the home of Space Command. In the months ahead, I plan to work with Senator Hickenlooper and the entire Colorado delegation to ensure the Biden Administration reviews the recommendation. I’m hopeful we can reverse it.
￼ 

VISITING DOUGLAS COUNTY 
On Tuesday I had a chance to visit the Sandstone Ranch in southwest Douglas County to learn about the partnership between local government and ranchers to restore native ecosystems through practices like regenerative grazing. Visits like this are a fundamental part of my job and are often the inspiration for bills we introduce back in Washington.  
During the visit I also had a chance to receive a briefing from Shoshana Lew, the Director of Colorado’s Department of Transportation, about progress to finish the Gap -- the 18-mile stretch of I-25 still under construction between Castle Rock and the Monument. The project was made possible in part by a $65 million federal grant I helped secure with former Senator Cory Gardner in 2018, and it was wonderful to be on the ground to receive an update on implementation. Good news: so far, the project is far ahead of schedule.

ACCELERATING VACCINE DISTRIBUTION 
The U.S. developed and approved vaccines in record speed, but distribution so far has been abysmally slow. We have to do better. On Tuesday, Senator Hickenlooper and I wrote to the Trump administration urging immediate action to fix the the vaccine distribution failures as cases continue to climb. We also asked the administration to explain its abject failure to develop and implement a comprehensive national vaccine plan despite having months to do so.

1/15/21 20:03,Why I Voted to Impeach President Trump,"￼ 


Dear Friend,
Last week, we experienced a tragic day in American history when President Donald Trump incited insurrection with irresponsible, aggressive rhetoric that encouraged and incited a mob of his supporters to violently breach and defile the United States Capitol Building.   This attack was a supreme act of domestic terrorism that ultimately led to bloodshed and death in the sacred temple of our democracy.
I took no joy in voting to impeach President Trump, but the president has blood on his hands in the wake of this attempted coup. The fact remains that no one, including the president of the United States, is above the law. And this president has sadly violated his oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.   As members of Congress who have taken that same pledge, it was our duty to take this action.
His constant bombardment of false information alleging widespread voter fraud and his repeated attempts to delegitimize the 2020 presidential election has deeply divided an already fractured nation and has violently turned American against American.   As this unprecedented attack on American democracy and our Constitution transpired, President Trump was reported to gleefully watch on television the attempted destruction to our nation’s capitol while ignoring repeated pleas for him to call on his supporters to stand down.
Trump continues to reject any responsibility for the violence and has shown no remorse or concern for those who have died because of his insurrection. A heartbreaking example was his initial failure to honor the fallen Capitol Police officers by lowering the White House flag to half-staff.
At a time when thousands of Americans are dying of an insidious virus, which demands effective presidential leadership and unity of purpose to defeat, the president continues to be focused solely on himself. Defeating this pandemic cannot be undertaken while we have a president who denies its existence and is actively encouraging violence to overturn a well-documented free and fair election.
Even after the tragedy of January 6th, Trump continues to fuel the fire of his supporters with his self-serving and dangerous rhetoric and to incite violence and distrust across America. He still refuses to denounce the insurrection and unequivocally call on his supporters to stand down from carrying out their armed threats against our nation’s capitol and state capitols across the country. 
This lack of leadership and concern for the lives of our countrymen and women is one more example that confirms Donald Trump is unfit for office and poses a true danger to America and American democracy. To protect our country and our democracy, he must be impeached and barred from holding federal office again.
I cast my vote for the safety of my constituents and all Americans nationwide, and for the survival of our democracy in the days, months, and years to come. In good conscience, I simply had no other choice.

1/15/21 19:21,A solemn duty,"￼

 
January 15, 2021
 
Dear Friend,
 Our nation faced a harsh reality last week as we watched mobs of pro-Trump domestic terrorists storm the Capitol during a deadly attempted effort to overturn the results of a free and fair election. President Trump poses a serious threat to the safety of our country and our democracy. He has shown time and again that he is either unable or unwilling to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States or the American people. Every day he remains in office, our country and our citizens are at risk. It is the solemn duty of Congress to protect and defend the U.S. Constitution and the American people and to serve as a check on the executive branch. We have much work to do to heal our nation and build a better future for all, and I believe part of that includes justice and accountability by constitutionally and forcefully condemning President Trump's role in inciting the violence at the Capitol and preventing him from causing further damage. We must set the precedent for generations to come that this is unacceptable. You can watch me discuss this on WMUR’s CloseUp earlier this week.
 
 
 
￼
 
My interview on CloseUp
 
I joined my colleagues in calling on Vice President Pence to convene the Cabinet and invoke the 25th Amendment earlier this week, and I voted in favor of impeachment on Wednesday. President Trump’s actions are beyond dereliction of duty — what took place last week was sedition. It’s our duty to hold him accountable for his role in inciting a violent insurrection and ensure that he is disqualified from holding office in the future. I urge the Senate to take action, and protect our democracy from further bloodshed or damage caused by this dangerous president. 
 
 
 
Facing Possible Exposure to COVID-19 
 
 
When the Capitol was invaded, those of us who were in the chamber during the insurrection were evacuated to a secure location. We were together for hours while we waited for the Capitol to be secured, and at least half a dozen of our Republican colleagues refused to wear masks. One of my colleagues offered them masks — face coverings are required inside the Capitol complex — but they refused.
 
Now, we have been informed that Members and staff may have been exposed to someone with an active COVID-19 infection while we sought safety in that room. It's difficult to comprehend this level of absurdity and the lack of regard for the health and wellbeing of others. I hope that anyone who has or does come down with COVID-19 makes a swift and full recovery. 
 
 
Saluting and Paying Tribute to Capitol Police Officers
 
 
As we recognized National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day on January 9th, I had our Capitol Police Officers on my mind. Tragically, we have lost two over the last week as a result of the deadly violence at the Capitol. After losing Officer Brian Sicknick the day after the attack at the Capitol, Officer Howard Liebengood’s death was announced on Sunday. For more than 15 years, Officer Liebengood served our nation and protected the halls of Congress — including during Wednesday’s deadly riot. The passing of these two Capitol Police officers is a tremendous tragedy, and I am sending my deepest condolences to their families and the Capitol Police force.
 My thoughts are also with Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman, who diverted the mob of rioters away from the Senate chambers during the attack on the Capitol. Officer Goodman’s courage and quick thinking kept these terrorists away from an unsecured Senate door, and he deserves to be recognized. That’s why I joined a bipartisan group of House Members yesterday in introducing legislation to award the Congressional Gold Medal to Officer Goodman. His actions were nothing short of heroic, and I urge House leadership to bring this legislation to the floor. 
 
 
 
Bringing Those Involved in the Capitol Attack to Justice
 
 On Wednesday, I joined Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill and more than 30 of our colleagues in sending a letter to the acting House Sergeant at Arms, the acting Senate Sergeant at Arms, and the U.S. Capitol Police requesting an investigation into suspicious activity at the Capitol on January 5, the day before pro-Trump rioters violently attacked the Capitol. Anyone who helped these terrorists gain access to the Capitol or aided their insurrection efforts must be brought to justice. 
 
 
 
Improving the Availability of Workforce Housing
 
 
I’m pleased that the Northern Forest Center will receive $1 million in federal funding from the Northern Border Regional Commission (NBRC) to launch efforts to help improve the availability of high-quality workforce housing in northern New Hampshire.
 The Northern Forest Center does incredibly important work to spur economic growth and job creation in rural New Hampshire communities. This funding will help the Center ensure there is adequate affordable housing in North Country communities, which is key to the economic viability of the region. I will continue working to ensure Granite Staters have the support and resources they need to succeed and thrive.
 
 
￼
 
 
Serving the Granite State on the Agriculture, Energy and Commerce Committees
 
 The deadly COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to improve access to affordable, quality health care, strengthen our health care infrastructure, expand access to broadband internet, and strengthen our agriculture supply chains. And that’s exactly what I’m focused on in the 117th Congress. I’m honored to be re-appointed to the Agriculture Committee, which I served on for my first three terms. I will be well-positioned to advocate for the priorities of New Hampshire’s agriculture industry, which contributes nearly one billion dollars to our state’s economy every year — and the Energy and Commerce Committee — where I will help lead the charge on developing forward-thinking legislative solutions to the problems facing our nation and addressing the critical issues that are most important to our New Hampshire communities. 
 
 
 
Supporting New Hampshire's Live Music and Entertainment Industry 
 
 
 
￼
  
Our discussion about Save Our Stages Act 
 
 
On Tuesday, I joined Senator Maggie Hassan and leaders from New Hampshire’s performance venue industry to discuss key provisions of the Save Our Stages Act, which was included in the latest COVID relief package that was signed into law. We also talked about what the legislation means for New Hampshire’s live music and entertainment industry, which employs thousands of Granite Staters.
 
COVID-19 and the necessary public health measures have taken a tremendous financial toll on New Hampshire, and our performance industry has been hit particularly hard. In addition to providing general enjoyment to the public, independent live music venues also play a meaningful role in the economy in New Hampshire and across the country. These businesses were some of the first to shut down and will likely be some of the last to re-open, and this legislation is the first step to ensure they will be able to re-open and serve our communities on the other side of this pandemic. I look forward to continuing to support our performance industry and working to bring support to those who need it in New Hampshire.
 
 
 
News You Can Use
 
 
The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) is now reopened for new borrowers and certain existing borrowers. I was happy to host a virtual roundtable with representatives from local Chambers of Commerce this week to listen to their concerns and share details on the rollout of this second round of PPP loans. Congress included $248B for additional PPP loans as part of the most recent relief package. For more information about what funds are available and the application process, businesses can contact their local lender or visit the US Small Business Administration website at https://www.sba.gov/ppp. My office is also available to assist with navigating the process either by visiting my website (www.kuster.house.gov) or calling our Concord office at (603) 226-1002. 
 
Starting next Friday, January 22, New Hampshire residents ages 65 and older will be able to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Those who are eligible can register for a vaccine at www.vaccines.nh.gov, with administration to that group beginning on January 26th. 
 
I’m so grateful to our New Hampshire National Guard members who have been essential to New Hampshire’s COVID-19 response. Now, they are helping to protect and defend our democracy during the peaceful transfer of power. We thank them for their service to our country and our state! 
 
As always, the CDC and the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services are the best resources to turn to during the COVID-19 public health emergency. If you are sick, stay home and call your health care provider. If you live in NH and have questions about coronavirus, dial 211 or visit CDC.gov for more information.
To stay updated on my work in Congress and around the Granite State, as well as for important information and resources, like my page on Facebook and follow me on Twitter. 
 
Remember: hope and brighter days are on the way! We’re all in this together, and we will come out stronger on the other side. In the meantime, I hope you have a fun and safe weekend and don’t forget to wear a mask when you are in public.
 
Sincerely, 
 
Annie

1/15/21 19:07,Senator Rick Scott's Week in Review,"￼ 
￼
￼
￼
￼
￼
This week, after President-elect Joe Biden announced his proposal for a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 spending package, Senator Rick Scott released the following statement denouncing the wasteful spending included in the plan for liberal priorities that have nothing to do with the coronavirus. Senator Scott will continue fighting for targeted relief that provides needed assistance to Americans hit hardest by this pandemic. 
Senator Rick Scott said, “The devastating impact of the coronavirus on our nation cannot be overstated. Since Communist China’s lies led to the spread of the virus and its vicious attack on American families one year ago, too many Americans have lost loved ones. Too many have felt the terrible hopelessness of job loss. Too many dreams of entrepreneurs and small family-owned businesses have been crushed in the wake of economic downturn.   “There is no question that we must do more to support those whose livelihoods have been torn from them due to this pandemic. I’ve said from the beginning that the efforts of Congress should be strategic, focusing on families and small businesses in need, and I have offered proposal after proposal doing just that. While there are some good things in President-elect Biden’s proposed package, like help for individuals and small businesses and increased support for vaccines and testing, he plans to spend too much of the $1.9 trillion dollars in taxpayer money on liberal priorities that have nothing to do with the coronavirus. Biden is following directly in the footsteps of failed politicians Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer by pushing policies like bailouts for wasteful, liberal states, a national $15 minimum wage mandate that will kill our small businesses, and more stimulus checks without accountability or eligibility measures for Americans who haven’t lost their jobs.   “We have to get serious about how we’re spending taxpayer dollars. Biden wants to spend more than $350 billion to bailout wasteful states. I’ve been clear – asking taxpayers to bailout failed politicians in liberal states like New York and Illinois and save them from their own bad decisions isn’t fair to fiscally responsible states like Florida. It makes no sense. Congress has already allocated more than $4.5 trillion to address this crisis. We still don’t know how much money is unspent from previous coronavirus relief packages; including the nearly $1 trillion package that was passed just three weeks ago. We cannot simply throw massive spending at this with no accountability to the current and future American taxpayer. I will continue fighting for targeted relief that provides needed assistance to Americans hit hardest by this pandemic; but I will not stand by and let failed liberal policies be used to mortgage our kids and grandkids futures.""

Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following reports that President-elect Biden is working with Senator Schumer to give New York City and the State of New York $2 billion in additional FEMA emergency funding to address budget shortfalls caused by decades of fiscal mismanagement by the city and state. This move by President-elect Biden means that he plans to authorize the use of the FEMA fund which provides critical aid following hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and other natural disasters to irresponsibly bailout wasteful, liberal state and local governments.   Senator Rick Scott said, “For months, Democrats have been trying to get Congress to bailout wasteful, liberal states for their decades of mismanagement and excesses, and for months, I’ve been fighting to protect taxpayer dollars and make sure that doesn’t happen. Now, President-elect Biden and Senator Schumer aren’t even hiding the fact that they want to circumvent Congress and send billions to their friends Bill de Blasio and Andrew Cuomo in New York. Congress has already allocated more than $4.5 trillion in taxpayer money to address the coronavirus crisis. States can moderate their economic harm through reasoned, balanced measures that protect citizens without destroying their economies. New York’s economy is still shut down, and its budget shortfalls are because De Blasio and Cuomo have continued to waste money and failed to prioritize their struggling constituents. It is irresponsible for Biden and Schumer to expect Florida and the rest of the country to pay for the failures of their friends in New York."" Read more HERE.

Senator Rick Scott Applauds Decision to Reinstate Cuba to the List of State Sponsors of Terrorism 
Senator Rick Scott applauded the Administration for its commitment to hold the Cuban regime accountable by reinstating Cuba as a State Sponsor of Terrorism. The State Department’s decision comes after Senator Scott urged the Administration to take this important step to continue the fight for freedom and end the instability, chaos and violence in Latin America.  Senator Rick Scott said, “For years, I’ve called for Cuba’s designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism to be reinstated, and I’m glad the Administration heeded those calls today. The Obama-Biden Administration’s appeasement policies toward Cuba allowed Havana to extend its reach and expand its control, giving power to other ruthless dictatorships in Latin America. Today, Cuba continues to oppress its people and those across Latin America by supporting narco-states run by dictators like Maduro and Ortega, while harboring terrorist groups. Reinstating Cuba’s rightful designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism signals to the global community that the U.S. will not tolerate rouge nations that oppress their people. It’s a great day in the fight for freedom and democracy in Latin America.” Read more HERE.

Senador Rick Scott aplaude la decisión de reinstalar a Cuba a la Lista de Estados Patrocinadores del Terrorismo 
El Senador Rick Scott aplaudió a la Administración por su compromiso en responsabilizar al régimen cubano y restablecer a Cuba como Estado Patrocinador del Terrorismo. La decisión del Departamento de Estado se produce luego de que el Senador Scott instara a la Administración a dar este importante paso para continuar la lucha por la libertad y poner fin a la inestabilidad, el caos y la violencia en América Latina.   El Senador Rick Scott dijo: “Durante años, he pedido que se restablezca la designación de Cuba como Estado Patrocinador del Terrorismo, y me complace que la Administración haya escuchado mi llamado hoy. Las políticas de apaciguamiento de la Administración Obama-Biden hacia Cuba permitieron que la Habana extendiera su alcance y expandiera su control, apuntalando a otras dictaduras despiadadas en América Latina. Hoy, Cuba continúa oprimiendo a su gente y a toda América Latina apoyando a los narco-estados dirigidos por dictadores como Maduro y Ortega, mientras albergan a grupos terroristas. Restablecer la designación de Cuba como Estado Patrocinador del Terrorismo le indica a la comunidad mundial que los Estados Unidos no tolerará a naciones que oprimen a su pueblo. Es un gran día en la lucha por la libertad y la democracia en América Latina”. Lea más AQUÍ.

Statement from Sen. Rick Scott on the Passing of Sheldon Adelson 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following the passing of Sheldon Adelson.    Senator Rick Scott said, “Our country has lost a giant of business, a man of principle and one of America’s great philanthropists. My heart goes out to Miriam and the entire Adelson family. Miriam was his partner in everything that he did and you could tell how much he loved and respected her whenever you were around him.   “Over the years, I got to know Sheldon through his work on combatting drug use and his efforts to support and defend Israel, causes that he dedicated his life to. He did everything in his power to make sure the world never forgot the horrors of the Holocaust or allowed the evil of anti-Semitism to go unchallenged. His commitment to freedom, security and opportunity for all was only matched by the passion with which he pursued that commitment. He changed the lives of millions and will forever be remembered as a leader who dedicated his life to the betterment of his country, the nation of Israel and the world."" Read more HERE.

Federal funds keep our schools running. With the award of $74.4 million this week, the Commonwealth has now received over $102 million in special federal funding to keep elementary and secondary teachers and staff paid and our students learning, even in the middle of the economic and health crisis caused by the pandemic. 

$74.4m for Marianas education

The Marianas is getting $74.4 million for K-12 education from the coronavirus relief measure enacted on December 27. The U.S. Department of Education announced the award on Monday. The relief act set aside $409 million for the four smaller U.S. insular areas, which was divided among them based on the formula in Title I-A of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I revised that statutory formula in 2015 to be more favorable to the Marianas. Of the $74.4 million for the Marianas, $61.7 million goes to the Public School System and will “guarantee that all of our classroom teachers and support staff will not experience a single payless payday,” according to PSS Commissioner of Education Dr. Alfred B. Ada. The balance of $12.7 million goes to the Governor to use for educational purposes. This distribution is the same as was used for CARES Act funding in 2020; and Governor Torres gave his entire share, $4.8 million, to Northern Marianas College. All the relief funding is in addition to the annual education aid that Congress provided in the FY21 appropriation. 
 

More money for NMC

The U.S. Department of Education announced on Thursday the Northern Marianas College is receiving $3,274,565 from funds allocated for institutions of higher education in December's coronavirus relief act. $919,666 are dedicated to NMC students for financial aid grants, which can be used for tuition, food, housing, health care, or child care. The relief measure, formally the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, requires that institutions prioritize students with exceptional need, such as students who receive Pell Grants, and includes grants to students exclusively enrolled in distance education. The remainder of the funds will help NMC defray expenses associated with coronavirus including distance education technology costs, faculty and staff trainings, and payroll. 
 
 

“Let’s Read!” Kagman High School. On Wednesday, congressional staff dropped off books from the Library of Congress Surplus Book Program to Kagman High School’s library. Thank you to KHS Librarian, Mrs. Maria Ornes, for the warm welcome and for all that you do to bring the gift of reading to students. Happy reading, Ayuyus. 
 

FEMA awards school funding

The Federal Emergency Management Agency announced award of funding for three Marianas schools on Friday to pay for damage caused by Super Typhoon Yutu in October 2018:
	•	$3.4m for Koblerville School. The CNMI Public School System is receiving $3,407,754.60 for rebuilding Koblerville Elementary School Eight of the buildings on the 10-building campus were so damaged they qualify for complete replacement. Two, the Cafeteria and Main Building, qualify for repair. 
	•	$1.4m for Mount Carmel School. This award provides $1,359,953.10 to restore the Mount Carmel Gymnasium Complex to it pre-disaster design, function, and capacity. Yutu tore away corrugated metal roofing from the gymnasium and the attached open-air stage, and damaged the nearby food service building. 
	•	$2.2m for Northern Marianas College. Super Typhoon Yutu caused catastrophic damage to the contents of 17 campus buildings. The $2,217,812.21 in federal funding for the College will replace utility tables, whiteboards and chalkboards, stools, desks, filing cabinets water dispensers, book shelves, office supplies, overhead projectors, laptops, refrigerators and other destroyed contents. 

Congratulations to students, teachers, school staff.
 
 

New COVID-19 variant. According to the CDC, a new COVID-19 Variant named B.1.1.7, which originated in the United Kingdom, is starting to appear in the US. There have been 76 documented cases of the new variant in the US, which is more easily transmissible and has the potential to spread further unless we take action to stop it. We must continue to wash our hands regularly, wear our masks, stand at least six feet apart and avoid crowds. And, please, get the vaccination when it becomes available to you. 
 
 

Phase 1B now open. COVID-19 vaccinations for the Phase 1B group opened on January 14. This includes: 
	•	Individuals aged 60 and older;
	•	Healthcare workers;
	•	Commonwealth Government employees;
	•	Teachers;
	•	Faith leaders; and 
	•	Certain contractors working on the COVID-19 response.

It is important for all of us to get vaccinated against COVID-19 if we want to keep our community healthy and get our economy open.
 
 

Bill lifts Medicaid cap

Four committee chairs, including new Chair of the House Appropriations Committee Rosa DeLauro (D-Connecticut), are among the thirty original cosponsors of legislation to provide unlimited Medicaid funding to the Marianas. I introduced the bill on Monday and have already met with President-elect Biden’s team asking for his administration’s support. Lifting the current funding cap was supported by the Obama-Biden administration in its 2017 budget proposal, but the Trump administration never followed through. Even so, we succeeded in getting big increases for Marianas Medicaid in the last Congress. The statutory cap on Medicaid for the Marianas was $6.7 million in fiscal 2019, but we raised funding to $62.3 million this year. The increase allowed the Commonwealth Health Center to remain open and reduced the need—and local spending—for off-island referrals. We also lowered the local match for federal Medicaid funds from 45 percent in 2019 to 10.8 percent this year. Before, every $1 the Commonwealth paid the federal government matched with $1.22. Now, every $1 from the Commonwealth brings in $8.26 from the U.S. That new rate is better than for any U.S. state. 
 

Appointed to four committees

Thanks to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for allowing me to serve on four committees in this Congress. She announced Thursday I will be serving on the Agriculture and Veterans Affairs committees and keeping my seats on the Natural Resources and Education and Labor committees. Ordinarily, Members of the House are limited to a maximum of two committee assignments. Without representation in the Senate and without a vote for President, the Marianas has only one person in the federal government to look out for our interests and we need to cover a lot of bases. My committee assignments line up with the issues most important to constituents. On the Education and Labor Committee I will be working on reopening schools, especially if I am reelected to chair the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education. I will also seek to remain Vice Chair of the House Natural Resources Committee with responsibility for insular affairs. That position has allowed me to call hearings on Medicaid and other issues important to territories. Agriculture Committee membership could help us reach the longstanding goal of having the Marianas included in the national food aid program, SNAP. And within the Veterans Affairs Committee, I can keep after the new Biden administration on placing full-time permanent VBA, Vet Center, and VHA staff in the Marianas, a requirement I attached to legislation last year.
 
 


 

President held to account

In response to the attack on the Capitol by persons instructed by President Trump to stop certification of the election results last Wednesday, two legislative actions passed the House this week. I cosponsored both. H.Res. 24 impeaches the President for the high crime of incitement of insurrection for his role in what we are now learning was a planned, coordinated attack. The President directed his followers to “walk to the Capitol” and “fight like hell.” And they did. H.Res. 21 calls on Vice President Pence to activate section 4 of the 25th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution to declare the President incapable of executing the duties of his office and to remove him from office. The Vice President has informed the House he does not intend to take this action. 
 
 

Day one: Immigration reform

Permanent status for persons, who were overlooked when Congress extended the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act to the Marianas, has always been a goal, along with ensuring employers have access to the labor needed to sustain and grow our economy. With Congress under Democratic leadership and an incoming Democratic President comes a significant opportunity to act on immigration reform. That is why I joined my fellow Congressional Hispanic Caucus colleagues in a letter to President-elect Biden, committing to work with him to build a system that restores our values and tradition as a nation of immigrants. As we work to advance immigration reform, I will continue to work to ensure Marianas immigration priorities are included in the legislation. 
 

Filipinos are H-2B eligible in 2021

The Philippines is once again among the countries, whose nationals are eligible for the H-2B program. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued its annual notice of designated countries on Wednesday. DHS, with the concurrence of the U.S. Department of State, determined inclusion of the Philippines serves U.S. interests. The agency cited the Department of Defense need for labor for military construction projects in Guam related to the U.S. military realignment, the demand for civilian construction that is expected to result, and the significant dependence on Philippine workers to supplement the local labor force in Guam and the Marianas in support of the decision. 
 

USCIS replaces LPR validity sticker

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services will no longer issue stickers to extend the validity of Permanent Resident Cards. Instead, “green card” holders, applying to extend status, will receive a Form I-797 notice of receipt. That, together with their green card, will serve as proof of LPR status for twelve months from the date on the front of the card, while the extension is being processed. According to USCIS, this change ensures LPRs with recently expired cards will have documentation of identity, employment authorization, and authorization to return to the United States after temporary foreign travel. For more information visit the Replace Your Green Card page. 
 

$250k to protect endangered snails

The Commonwealth’s Division of Fish and Wildlife has been awarded $249,086 in Competitive State Wildlife Grant funds, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced Tuesday. Funding will be used to help protect three species of native tree snails in the Marianas listed as “Species of Greatest Conservation Need” in the CNMI Wildlife Action Plan. Two species are federally listed as endangered, while a third – the Rota Tree Snail – is a novel species that has yet to be formally described. These three species are found in only 13 sites in Rota and Saipan. DFW will implement a combination of monitoring, direct management, evaluation of predator control measures, and planning to develop a course for long-term recovery of these endangered snails. Congratulations to DFW for being one of only 17 state agencies to receive a 2020 Competitive State Wildlife Grant. 
 

$300k for transit innovation
﻿
Congratulations to the Commonwealth Office of Transit Authority for their successful application of a $300,000 competitive COVID-19 Research Demonstration Program grant. Grants funds will go towards supporting developing, deploying, and demonstrating innovative solutions that improve the operational efficiency of public transit agencies as well as enhance the mobility of transit users affected by the COVID-19 public health emergency. Eligible projects include vehicle, facility, equipment and infrastructure cleaning and disinfection; exposure mitigation measures; and measures that strengthen public confidence in transit services. 
 
 

VA hosts virtual benefits workshop. The VA Honolulu Regional Office will host a Virtual Benefits Workshop for Veterans, family members, surviving spouses, and community providers on Tuesday, January 19, 2021 from 5PM-7PM. Veterans looking to better understand benefits eligibility requirements and the different types of veteran benefits available are encouraged to attend. This is also an opportunity to ask questions to VBA officials directly. To access the workshop link and briefing slides, visit the Honolulu Regional Office website.

BROADBAND 
Take a Speed Test Here. 
The sad fact is that many places in West Virginia simply do not have access to reliable broadband and the lack of access affects West Virginians every day. Back in 2015, the FCC released a coverage map that stated 99.9% of Americans had wireless coverage. I knew then what I know now: That is just plain wrong. 
HOW MAY WE HELP YOU? 
To request assistance from my case team, click here.  As your U.S. Senator, I am proud to be your voice with government agencies during your time of need. My goal is for me and my staff to provide the best possible customer service for every West Virginian who contacts me needing assistance. While I have no direct jurisdiction in legal or administrative matters of any federal, state, or local agency, I welcome the opportunity to assist you in any way possible and to assure that full consideration is given to your case. See one of our success stories below:

From the Hill to the Mountains
JANUARY 15, 2021: MANCHIN URGES UTILIZATION OF INCREASED FUNDING AND SUPPORT FOR HOMELESS STUDENTS IN WEST VIRGINIA  Charleston, WV – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) urged the Department of Education to swiftly implement additional support he secured in the year-end package to better assist students experiencing homelessness in West Virginia. Schools across the state have reported a significant increase in student homelessness due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Senator said in part, ""It is now more urgent than ever before to address the needs of students experiencing homelessness. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Department’s data showed that 1.5 million homeless children and youth were identified and enrolled in public schools – an 11 percent increase over the previous school year and the highest number on record.  The economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has undoubtedly exacerbated this situation, causing more families and youth to struggle without a safe, stable home environment, and creating even more barriers to their education."" 
JANUARY 13, 2021: DOZENS OF RURAL WEST VIRGINIA HEALTH PROVIDERS ELIGIBLE FOR FUNDING AFTER MANCHIN EFFORTS  Charleston, WV – U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) announced that six West Virginia counties are now eligible for funding through the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) which determines a large percentage of grants and awards for rural health providers. After Senator Manchin’s efforts, HRSA made revisions to the Rural-Urban Commuting Areas (RUCA) codes, which changed Boone, Clay, Hampshire, Lincoln, Preston and Wirt counties from “urban” to “rural”. In October 2020, Senator Manchin submitted comments supporting the HRSA policy change.  ""After pushing for over a year to change the classification system that kept rural West Virginia counties from crucial healthcare funding, HRSA announced revisions to the RUCA codes are complete, making dozens of health providers eligible for rural grants and assistance across West Virginia,"" said Senator Manchin. ""I am pleased our hard work paid off and health providers now have access to funding that supports critical programs including black lung/coal miner clinics programs, rural opioid response programs, rural HIV/AIDS planning programs, rural telehealth programs, State Offices of Rural Health, hospital flex grants, and many more. While we did not change all of the county classifications we advocated for, I will continue to work with HRSA to change the classifications and get our health providers the funding they need to serve West Virginians."" 
JANUARY 13, 2021: MANCHIN CHAMPIONED RENTAL ASSISTANCE FOR WEST VIRGINIANS  Senator Manchin Led Calls For Rental Assistance In Initial COVID Relief Assistance Proposal Charleston, WV – In December, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) championed rental assistance programs for West Virginians when he led COVID-19 emergency relief negotiations. Senator Manchin’s initial emergency relief proposal – which was the framework of the final package – included $25 billion in rental assistance. As a result of Senator Manchin’s leadership, West Virginia is slated to receive an estimated $200 million from the federal Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA) program that was established in the recent COVID-19 stimulus package. These funds will be administered through the West Virginia Housing Development Fund to assist Mountaineers with paying rent, utilities, and other housing-related needs incurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  ""Across the state, West Virginians are struggling to find jobs, put food on the table, or keep a roof over their head due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I fought to include rental assistance in the recent COVID-19 stimulus package and now West Virginia will receive an estimated $200 million from the Emergency Rental Assistance program to provide rental assistance and help keep a roof over our neighbors’ heads. I will continue to work with federal, state, and local parties to ensure this program is up and running as quickly as possible so West Virginians can get the help they need during these difficult times,"" said Senator Manchin. 
  
  
HONORING CHUCK YEAGER’S LEGACY
MANCHIN HONORS GENERAL CHUCK YEAGER  Charleston, WV – U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), released a video tribute honoring the life and legacy of General Chuck Yeager, an American hero and native West Virginian.  ""The legacy Chuck leaves is such an important part of our heritage as West Virginians.  Our little state has mined the coal that forged the steel that built the tanks and ships that keep our country the strongest in the world. It is an honor to remember Chuck as part of our military service heritage and our way of life that sinks deep into the roots of West Virginia’s rich culture. I encourage all Americans to learn what they can about this legendary West Virginian,” Senator Manchin said in part.

WV STRONG
I was always taught that if you can count your blessings, you can share your blessings. I’ve been seeing so many great WV Strong and Better Angels stories. During these unprecedented times, it’s important to focus on all the wonderful things that are still happening every day in our beautiful state. 
Nominated as today’s Better Angels are the volunteers for Sarah’s Table in Morgantown. This service organization, comprised of volunteers from the community as well as from St. John’s, St. Mary’s, St. Luke’s and St. Francis parishes in Morgantown, has fed the local homeless for many years and has altered their methods to continue serving the community during the pandemic. Volunteers now collect and bag individually wrapped food products and wrapped sandwiches from local restaurants for safe distribution to those in need. I thank each of you for your service and generosity to your fellow West Virginians, especially during this challenging time. 
Please continue sharing your stories of hope, joy, and volunteerism by emailing your nomination and a photo to WVSTRONG@manchin.senate.gov .

WORKING FOR YOU
MANCHIN, CAPITO ANNOUNCE $339 MILLION FOR COVID-19 RELIEF TO WEST VIRGINIA SCHOOLS  Charleston, WV - U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $339,000,000 from the U.S. Department of Education as part of the most recent COVID-19 relief package to help West Virginia schools respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. This funding can be used for testing, to address learning loss, and to assist schools in ways like improving air quality in buildings as schools prepare for eventual reopening. This funding was made available through the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund (ESSER), and builds on a previously announced award from the CARES Act at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  ""The COVID-19 pandemic hit our students, teachers, and faculty hard, forcing them to quickly adjust to new ways of learning and teaching. During the negotiations for the emergency COVID-19 relief package passed at the end of last year, I advocated for this funding to support our schools and students as they navigate these difficult times. I’m glad West Virginia has received this funding to help with testing and other priorities and will continue to fight for West Virginia priorities in any future relief legislation,"" said Senator Manchin.

New Relief for Granite State Small Businesses
New Hampshire’s small businesses are the engines of our economy. Throughout the pandemic, many have worked to adapt and continue to provide essential services, but they still face immense challenges.  This week, I hosted a public panel with Senator Shaheen to discuss with New Hampshire small businesses and nonprofits the new support available to them through the COVID-19 relief and government funding package that became law last month.  Among this support is an extension of the Paycheck Protection Program, which has helped businesses throughout our state during the pandemic. The program reopened this past week for a subset of businesses and nonprofits, and it opens to all eligible entities on Tuesday.  Businesses and nonprofits interested in participating in the program can learn more at sba.gov/ppp.  In addition, the new COVID-19 relief package includes legislation that I fought for to build on the resources available to small businesses. Now, eligible small employers are able to both participate in the Paycheck Protection Program and also claim the Employee Retention Tax Credit to help keep workers on payroll and pay for their health care coverage. Previously, small employers could not participate in both of these programs.  This relief will help our small businesses get through some of the most challenging months of this pandemic, but this is meant to be targeted aid. My top priority at the start of this new session of Congress is working with the Biden administration and members of both parties to pass additional COVID-19 relief. By continuing this bipartisan work, we can strengthen our public health response, create jobs, and rebuild an economy as inclusive and strong as ever. 
  
With every good wish,  ￼   Senator Maggie Hassan 
What the Senator is Working On
The Department of Health and Human Services announced that it will roll back a requirement that limited physicians’ ability to prescribe buprenorphine, a medication that helps to treat opioid addiction. Senator Hassan has long pushed for the elimination of this requirement, including through bipartisan legislation that she introduced. Read more here.  Senators Hassan and Shaheen announced that five New Hampshire projects will benefit from funding through the Land and Water Conservation Fund and National Parks and Public Land Legacy Restoration Fund established by the Great American Outdoors Act to support outdoor recreation, conservation efforts, and address maintenance needs. Learn more here.  Senator Hassan, along with Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, MD and Democratic Senator Bob Casey, requested a review of how colleges and universities are working to ensure that students with disabilities can access the same learning opportunities as their peers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Read more here.

Senator Hassan honored the New Hampshire citizens she recognized in 2020 as Granite Staters of the Month this past Saturday during a virtual event, where she commended them for all that they have done to help improve their communities and help their neighbors.

January 15, 2021
Dear friend,
This was another eventful week in our country's history as the consequences of the attack on the Capitol are still being felt. Security failures are being investigated, the House impeached President Trump again and now, a heavy National Guard presence is seen in Washington, D.C. ahead of President-elect Biden's inauguration.
We're still appalled and saddened by the violence seen on January 6th, but as the dust settles, we must remember that a great deal of work lies ahead. 
San Diego families and businesses are in dire need of support to help them through the remainder of this pandemic. Yesterday, President-elect Biden announced his American Rescue Plan to control the virus and help our economy recover from this crisis. The plan is a strong start to getting the country back on its feet. I'm confident that the response to this pandemic will dramatically improve under the leadership of the incoming Biden-Harris administration. You can find my full statement on this plan here.
I continue my work in the district to stay in touch with the people I represent. Below is another update on some of the work my staff and I have done this week to serve you.

Meeting with Congregation Beth Israel's new senior rabbi
￼
This week, I met with Congregation Beth Israel's new senior Rabbi Jason Nevarez. In times of division and polarization, the faith-based community plays an important role in the lives of many San Diegans to bring people together and foster kindness and empathy. I was glad to hear about the rabbi's vision for the congregation and look forward to working together in the future for the community.

Marine Corps Reserve Association meeting
I met with Lieutenant Colonel Stan Smith (Ret.), the San Diego chapter president of the Marine Corps Reserve Association. We spoke about the importance of keeping Marine Corps Recruit Depot (MCRD) in San Diego. During our conversation, I restated my commitment to keeping MCRD here: San Diego has a long tradition of training the few, the proud and the brave, and that tradition will not cease on my watch. Our San Diego military bases serve as a critical deterrent to future Pacific wars and contribute significantly to the local economy.
The mission of the Marine Corps Reserve Association includes advancing the professional knowledge of the members of the United States Marine Corps Reserve and representing and assisting individual members and their families. I appreciated speaking with LtCol Smith about supporting the Marine Corps here in San Diego, a proud military town.

Taxpayers receiving second economic impact payments by debit card
To speed the delivery of economic impact payments to as many people as possible, the Treasury Department and the IRS are issuing millions of prepaid debit cards, along with paper checks and direct deposit.
If the Get My Payment tool on IRS.gov shows a date on which your payment was mailed, you should watch your mail for either a paper check or debit card. The debit cards will be sent to those eligible who don't receive direct deposit. They arrive in a white envelope that prominently displays the U.S. Department of the Treasury seal (pictured here.)

Information on the 59th Presidential Inauguration
The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies remains committed to working with its many partners to execute safe inaugural ceremonies that showcase our democracy. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, attendance for the 59th Presidential Inauguration was limited, and Congressional offices were unable to fulfill inauguration ticket requests. The ceremony will be made available to watch live online.

2020 Year In Review
This past year has been extremely difficult for all of us, but I wanted to take a moment to look back at some of what we accomplished in 2020. I was grateful that Congress was able to pass the COVID-19 stimulus bill and the 2021 Appropriations bill in December. Two of the provisions of the COVID-19 stimulus bill that I fought for were the expansion of Paycheck Protection Program eligibility and the deadline extension for the Coronavirus Relief Fund (CRF), which allows our state and others to continue to spend funds from the CARES Act for pandemic-related purposes. You can learn more about some of our legislative accomplishments over the last year in the video below.

My Letter Calling On the CDC to Prevent Vaccine Waste
Last week, I led a bipartisan letter signed by 32 members of Congress to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) requesting that the CDC update its guidance to ensure that none of the vital COVID-19 vaccine doses would go to waste due to expiration related to distribution delays.
While the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) outlined an effective tier system for determining which groups receive the vaccine first, based on age, occupation, or other risk factors, and we should make every effort to prioritize higher risk individuals, common sense must be applied. In situations in which vaccines’ shelf lives create a choice in the final 24 hours between vaccinating lower priority individuals or no one, we must not allow a single dose to go to waste. The distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine is an enormous undertaking for state governments, and more specific instructions from the CDC on the protocol for using doses before expiration will be helpful. The pandemic continues to rage on, and we can’t afford to waste vaccine doses due to poor planning.
As we stated in our letter, if the CDC does not outline the requested guidance on vaccine waste, we will provide a legislative solution to ensure that every vaccine is administered in a timely fashion.
Introduction of the Public Service Appreciation Through Loan Forgiveness Act
As I continue to work with members from both parties on a range of policies to increase college affordability, expand career and technical education, and reduce student debt, on Monday, I introduced the Public Service Appreciation Through Loan Forgiveness Act. This bill would accelerate student loan forgiveness under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program for those who enter public service through working at government organizations and tax-exempt not-for-profit organizations such as teachers, police officers, municipal workers, and employees at nonprofits or charities.
My legislation shortens the period after which loan forgiveness begins for employees under the Public Loan Forgiveness Program from ten years to four years. Participants would have their student loans reduced by 10% after four years of regular, on-time payments while working in public service, 20% after six years, 50% after eight years, and would completely forgive remaining debts after ten years of regular payments.

Unity at the Crossroads
Dear Friends,
America stands at a pivotal crossroads. Many of us have felt the political tensions rising for months. We began 2020 with a baseless, divisive and ultimately unsuccessful impeachment. Before things had even begun to settle, America was hit by the Coronavirus pandemic and the ensuing vast overreach by state and local governments implementing burdensome lockdowns and nonsensical mandates. Then came the Georgie Floyd riots and the extremist “Defund the Police” movement. We ended the year with a hotly contested presidential election that tens of millions of Americans – including myself – believe was riddled with fraud and irregularities.
January 6, 2021 was intended to be a day to highlight and discuss the many unanswered concerns surrounding the election by raising objections to the Electoral College certification in a Joint Session of Congress. Instead, our nation’s Capitol Building was the scene of an out-of-control and violent riot that led to the deaths of at least five individuals, including U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick. That death toll does not include the officer who took his own life, Howard Liebengood Jr., or the dozens of officers who sustained serious injuries. My wife, Dee Dee, and I continue to pray for these brave officers and their families.
For those of us who have worked in and around the Capitol, January 6 was a horrifying and deeply disturbing day. My staff and I were there. We were evacuated twice and locked down for several hours before law enforcement regained control of the Capitol complex. The situation got out of hand very quickly and it was every bit as chaotic as it seemed on television. However, things would have been much worse without the heroic actions of the U.S. Capitol Police. I have the pleasure of knowing many of these officers, and I can tell you that they are upstanding and dedicated public servants. These brave men and women stood on the frontlines for hours, being assaulted by violent rioters using lead pipes and other objects, to defend Members of Congress and our staffs. May God bless them and their families, and all Americans should honor their heroic sacrifices.
￼

This never should have happened, and we must ensure it never happens again. We need to fully investigate who these individuals were, how they were organized, how they entered the Capitol in such large numbers, who is responsible for the explosive devices discovered, how the security perimeter collapsed so quickly, and so on. Ultimately, whoever these people are and whatever cause they claim to support, I reject and condemn both them and their actions, and I look forward to seeing them prosecuted fully.
As a Christian conservative, I have always supported law enforcement and the rule of law. For months, I have been shocked and angered by the radical Left’s rampage through our nation’s cities – looting, rioting, burning businesses, targeting police, and attacking innocent civilians, often with the support of liberal media figures and elected Democrats. I have consistently spoken out against this wildly irresponsible and dangerous behavior. I feel no differently about the events of January 6 than I do about the unrest during the summer. Any sort of political violence is reprehensible and un-American. Political violence too often spawns yet more political violence, and we must never respond to it in kind. It must end now.
As shameful and tragic as January 6 was, it does not change the fact that tens of millions of Americans believe the November 3 general election was fraudulent. When the People lose faith in our electoral system and cease believing that they can enact change at the ballot box, we risk losing our entire Republic. The only way to fix this crisis of confidence is by exposing and correcting the flaws in our election system. That is what January 6’s Electoral College certification was supposed to be about!
In the days leading up to January 6, I worked with fellow conservatives like Jim Jordan, Ted Cruz, and many others in creating a strong coalition of Members of Congress eager to set things straight. I was to lead the objection to Georgia’s slate of electors with Senator Kelly Loeffler, thereby giving us two hours to highlight the many unanswered concerns in Georgia. I never anticipated my objection being agreed to by a majority of the Congress or that the outcome of the election would be reversed. This was an effort to restore confidence by shining sunlight on the allegations that must be addressed. Contrary to what many liberal partisans now claim, Democrats have made similar objections numerous times in recent years and there is nothing unlawful or seditious about our objections. Period.
Unfortunately, when I was able to make the objection after order had been restored, we lacked a Senate partner needed for full consideration as Senator Loeffler and others had backed out after the riot. The storming of the Capitol, supposedly done in support of President Trump, completely undermined our lawful attempt to highlight the evidence of fraud being ignored by the mainstream media and the courts.
Next week, Joe Biden will be sworn in as the 46th President of the United States of America. President-elect Biden has publicly committed himself to restoring unity across the partisan divide and healing the country. I am disappointed but not surprised that Congressional Democrats have thrown that promise out the window by rushing to impeach President Trump in his final days in office. I opposed their misguided impeachment effort because I believe that we, as federal elected representatives, should concentrate on restoring calm and deescalating – not scoring cheap political points.
Going forward, there will undoubtedly be many fierce debates to come. I am deeply concerned by the toxic and extremist legislative agenda being pushed by Democrats in Washington. At the start of this note, I said America stands at a pivotal crossroads. 
As Americans, we must decide whether we will preserve our way of life, keep the values and principles we hold dear, and defend the liberty we inherited from our forefathers… Or will we embrace the radical platform of Socialism and Marxism that has seeped into our politics. No matter how ferocious the debates become, we must remain peaceful and abide by the rule of law –and we must use every legal means to stop the rising tide of Socialism and Marxism. That is how we win. That is how we preserve our Republic.

Impeachment Vote 
Last week the nation watched as a violent mob attacked the Capitol, disrupting and delaying a vital step in our electoral process. The mob damaged and stole property, assaulted members of law enforcement and caused five deaths, including one Capitol Police Officer. This attack was both disgusting and tragic.
President Trump bears responsibility for this. There is enough blame to go around. The statements of other elected officials, the 24-7 news media that seek out controversy, and social media platforms where going viral is more important than the truth have all contributed to the decay of civil discourse. Words and actions mean something, and reckless rhetoric has real world consequences.
Like anyone else, I am angry about what happened. But history is replete with poor judgments made in anger leading to knee jerk reactions.
This brings us to where we are today. The House will vote on Articles of Impeachment, opting for speed over deliberation. The majority is not holding hearings in which all the facts can be presented.
Any reading of the Constitution and the Federalist Papers shows that impeachment was intended to be a seldom-used tool done through a deliberative process, not a snap judgment of a majority.
Both Republicans and Democrats have called for unity in the aftermath of January 6. However, a leading Democrat stated we “can’t have unity without truth”; but how do you find truth without holding hearings or assessing all the evidence? What precedent does this set for the future, when Presidents could be subject to a rushed impeachment without due process?
Will the House impeaching the President do anything to prevent further violence from happening, or will it simply inflame an already tense situation? Our primary goal should be to ensure a peaceful and smooth transition of power over the next week until Joe Biden is sworn into office on January 20.
Ultimately, the people responsible for this heinous act – whether they committed violence or incited the crowds – will be held accountable. But right now, it is imperative that we turn down the temperature and restore calm to this country.
With the benefit of all the facts, it may become evident that the President did indeed commit an impeachable offense. However, with a truncated, rushed process, I can’t fairly make that judgment and will vote against the Article of Impeachment today.

Week of January 10, 2021  IMPEACHMENT

On Wednesday, I voted against impeaching President Trump. As our beloved country prepares for a peaceful transition of power into a Biden Administration, it’s time that we all come together, not as Democrats and Republicans, but as Americans. Abandoning norms and traditions to impeach President Trump with less than ten days left in his term will only cause more hatred and division across our communities. 

As Members of Congress, we have a duty to do what’s best for our nation. Let’s tone down the rhetoric and focus on the issues we came to Washington to solve for our constituents. We have a lot to be optimistic about, and it’s time we work together on common-sense solutions to get the United States of America back on track.

HONORING OUR CAPITOL POLICE
 
I am still in shock and disgusted with the violence and hatred we witnessed last week at our nation’s Capitol. These actions are not representative of what it means to be an American, plain and simple. Every single one of the violent rioters should be held accountable and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. 

My staff joined our colleagues this week to honor and thank the countless Capitol Police officers who put their lives on the line to protect us during the Capitol building attack. Their heroic actions saved American lives and allowed us to finish our constitutional duty later that night. We owe them a debt of gratitude.

￼


OFFICER EUGENE GOODMAN
 
During the attacks on the Capitol last week, Officer Goodman put his life on the line to save countless others. As the violent mob was chasing him up the Capitol steps and quickly approaching the Senate Floor, Officer Goodman put himself in harm’s way to lure the rioters away from the unguarded entrance, giving Senators more time to evacuate. 

Officer Goodman is a hero, and I am proud to co-sponsor H.R. 305 to award United States Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman the Congressional Gold Medal for his selfless act of bravery during the Capitol Attacks. 

￼


LEGISLATIVE ACTION THIS WEEK


Cosponsorships:

Saving America's Energy Future Act– Rep. Pfluger: This bill would prohibit the Biden administration from declaring a moratorium on issuing new oil and gas permits for drilling on federal lands.

Palestinian International Terrorism Support Prevention Act– Rep. Mast: This bill would impose sanctions on foreign persons, agencies, and governments that support Hamas, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, and other similar groups. 

Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act– Rep. Foxx: This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to prohibit the Department of Health and Human Service (HHS) from providing federal family planning grants to entities that perform abortions or provide funds to entities that perform abortions. 

Second Chance at Life Act – Rep. Lamborn: The bill requires abortion facilities to provide women seeking chemical abortions with information about the possibility of reversing the effects of the procedure.

No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act – Rep. Smith: This bill would make the Hyde Amendment and other current abortion funding prohibitions permanent and government-wide, and it would ensure that the Affordable Care Act (ACA) faithfully conforms to the Hyde Amendment.

Donna Doss Memorial Act – Rep. Arrington: This bill would designate the Rocksprings Station of the U.S. Border Patrol in Rocksprings, TX in honor of Agent Donna Doss who was killed last year by a car while responding to a call.

Death Tax Repeal Act – Rep. Smith: The bill would repeal the estate and generation-skipping transfer taxes.

PRESS RELEASE
For Immediate Release
January 15, 2021


Representative Adriano Espaillat Introduces The Federal Death Penalty Abolition Act of 2021


NEW YORK, NY - Today, Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) released the following statement on the introduction of his comprehensive legislation to abolish the federal death penalty.

“The death penalty is a cruel relic of the past, and should have no place in our society,” said Rep. Adriano Espaillat (NY-13). “A government should not have the power to take the life of another person, and the death penalty is a deeply flawed and inherently unjust system.

“The death penalty is fundamentally racist, and its roots can be traced directly to America’s terrible history of lynching. Over 42 percent of those on death row and 34 percent of those executed in America are Black, but only 13 percent of America’s population is black. Furthermore, those convicted of killing White victims are seventeen times more likely to be sentenced to death than would be if the victim was Black. The racial disparities in the death penalty are beyond the pale, and we must amend this racist legacy of our criminal justice system,"" Espaillat continued.

“Human life is invaluable, and every human life is sacred. Yet, the death penalty forgets a core tenet of humanity – human beings change. Humans have an immense capacity to learn, to heal, and to grow. Executing someone denies this principle and gives no course for a person to grow. A person is not defined by the worst choice they made, but the death penalty only views someone’s life through this narrow lens. And what’s more, it undermines the core vision upon which this nation was founded. I am proud to introduce this legislation, and believe it is a critical step towards a more righteous, equitable, and just society for all Americans,” he concluded.

The Federal Death Penalty Abolition Act of 2021 has been endorsed by more than 200 organizations nationwide, including:  NAACP, ACLU, Amnesty International USA, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Innocence Project, National Black Justice Coalition, Southern Poverty Law Center, National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, Death Penalty Action, 8th Amendment Project, Brennan Center for Justice at NYU School of Law, Friends Committee on National Legislation, Vera Institute of Justice, Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, Southern Center for Human Rights, Jewish Council for Public Affairs, Equal Justice USA, Conservatives Concerned About the Death Penalty, Grassroots Leadership, Drug Policy Alliance. 

Click here for the full list of organizations who have pledged their support of this bill. 

""We are past-time as a Nation ending the practice of killing Americans to prove killing is wrong. We must end this barbaric and inhumane practice now. We have learned that executing Americans continues to be administered in a definitively racist, and classes manner. The financial cost is exorbitant, and there is no evidence that the practice helps reduce murders or other crimes. More African Americans than any other race or ethnicity are erroneously executed and either freed or mistakenly executed. This collateral damage must stop as it is actually more expensive to sentence someone to life in prison than executing them. Thank you Representative Espaillat for demonstrating the moral imperative and we look forward to engaging our membership throughout the United States to pass this crucial legislation."" – Hilary O. Shelton, Director, NAACP Washington Bureau and Senior Vice President for Policy and Advocacy

""These past seven months, we watched the Trump administration plow through 12 executions, which were exceptionally dangerous and inhumane, during a pandemic that has already taken far too many lives. But the federal death penalty — like the death penalty in the states — has always been racist, error-prone, and arbitrary. The only way to turn the page on this dark moment in U.S. history is to repeal the federal death penalty once and for all.” – Cynthia Roseberry, Deputy Director of Policy, Justice Division, ACLU

""The National Black Justice Coalition believes the death penalty is an ancient idea that should be left in the last millennium. There have been too many cases of innocent people murdered on death row due to gross negligence and inequities in our criminal justice system. Our government should not decide who is ""redeemable"" especially when the facts of the case are too often wrong when it comes to people of color and other marginalized communities."" – Victoria Kirby York, Deputy Executive Director, National Black Justice Coalition

“Throughout history, Black people targeted by law enforcement and without the guarantee of a fair trial have disproportionately wound up on death row, especially in the Deep South states like Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi.” – Southern Poverty Law Center

“We are pleased to see so much interest and enthusiasm to move forward with this legislation. As we look to our nation’s critical mission of reinforcing and expanding our commitment to a diverse, vibrant representative democracy where we invest in people, healthy neighborhoods and communities and insist on government accountability, capital punishment has no place in that future. We thank Representative Espaillat for his leadership, vision and commitment to justice.” – Diann Rust-Tierney, Executive Director, National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty

“Death Penalty Action is honored to stand with Rep. Espaillat, who has never hesitated to emphatically oppose the death penalty. Death Penalty Action was created to mobilize people to action, and we urge everyone to use the tools at DeathPenaltyAction.org to contact their members of congress to request support for ending the federal and military death penalty laws in the first 100 days of the new Administration.” – Abraham Bonowitz, Director, Death Penalty Action

""Repealing the death penalty is an essential step to begin to address the racist legacy of our criminal legal system."" – Laura Porter, Executive Director, 8th Amendment Project

Congresista Adriano Espaillat introduce Ley Federal de Abolición de la Pena de Muerte de 2021


NEW YORK, NY – Hoy, el congresista Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) emitió la siguiente declaración sobre la introducción de su legislación integral para abolir la pena de muerte federal.

“La pena de muerte es una reliquia cruel del pasado y no debería tener lugar en nuestra sociedad”, dijo el Rep. Adriano Espaillat (NY-13). “Un gobierno no debería tener el poder de quitarle la vida a otra persona, y la pena de muerte es un sistema profundamente defectuoso e inherentemente injusto.

“La pena de muerte es fundamentalmente racista, y sus raíces se remontan directamente a la terrible historia de linchamientos en los Estados Unidos. Más del 42 por ciento de los condenados a muerte y el 34 por ciento de los ejecutados en Estados Unidos son negros, pero solo el 13 por ciento de la población estadounidense es negra. Además, los condenados por matar a víctimas blancas tienen diecisiete veces más probabilidades de ser condenados a muerte que si la víctima fuera negra. Las disparidades raciales en la pena de muerte son intolerables y debemos enmendar este legado racista de nuestro sistema de justicia penal"", continuó Espaillat.

“La vida humana es invaluable, y toda vida humana es sagrada. Sin embargo, la pena de muerte olvida un principio fundamental de la humanidad: los seres humanos pueden cambiar. Los seres humanos tenemos una inmensa capacidad para aprender, sanar y crecer. Ejecutar a alguien niega este principio y no ofrece una vía para que una persona crezca. Una persona no se define por la peor decisión que tomó, pero la pena de muerte solo ve la vida de alguien a través de este lente estrecho. Y, sobre todo, socava la visión central sobre la que se fundó esta nación. Me enorgullece presentar esta legislación y creo que es un paso fundamental hacia una sociedad más moral, equitativa y justa para todos los estadounidenses”, concluyó.

La Ley Federal de Abolición de la Pena de Muerte de 2021 ha sido respaldada por más de 200 organizaciones en todo el país, entre ellas: NAACP, ACLU, Amnistía Internacional de EE.UU., Asociación Nacional de Abogados de Defensa Penal, Proyecto Inocencia, National Black Justice Coalition, Southern Poverty Law Center, Coalición Nacional para Abolir la Pena de Muerte, Acción contra la Pena de Muerte, Proyecto de la 8va. Enmienda, Centro Brennan para la Justicia de la Facultad de Derecho de la Universidad de Nueva York, Comité de Amigos en la Legislación Nacional, Instituto de Justicia Vera, Centro de Acción Religiosa de Reforma del Judaísmo, Centro Sur de Derechos Humanos, Consejo Judío para Asuntos Públicos, Equal Justice USA, Conservadores Preocupados por la Pena de Muerte, Grassroots Leadership, Drug Policy Alliance.

Haga clic aquí para ver la lista completa de organizaciones que se han comprometido a apoyar este proyecto de ley.

""Desde hace tiempo que como nación debimos pone fin a la práctica de matar estadounidenses para demostrar que matar está mal. Debemos poner fin a esta práctica bárbara e inhumana ahora. Hemos aprendido que la ejecución de estadounidenses sigue siendo administrada de una manera definitivamente racista y clasista. El costo financiero es exorbitante y no hay evidencia de que la práctica ayude a reducir los asesinatos u otros delitos. Más afroamericanos que cualquier otra raza o etnia son ejecutados erróneamente, y ya sea liberados o ejecutados por error. Este daño colateral debe detenerse, ya que en realidad es más costoso ejecutar a alguien que condenarlo a cadena perpetua. Gracias congresista Espaillat por indicar el imperativo moral y esperamos involucrar a nuestros miembros en todo Estados Unidos para aprobar esta legislación crucial"". - Hilary O. Shelton, directora de la Oficina de Washington de NAACP y vicepresidenta sénior de Políticas y Promoción.

""En los últimos siete meses, vimos cómo en la administración Trump se realizaron 12 ejecuciones, que fueron excepcionalmente peligrosas e inhumanas, durante una pandemia que ya se ha cobrado demasiadas vidas. Pero la pena de muerte federal —como la pena de muerte en los estados—, siempre ha sido racista, propensa a errores y arbitraria. La única forma de pasar página en este momento oscuro de la historia de Estados Unidos es derogar la pena de muerte federal de una vez por todas"". - Cynthia Roseberry, subdirectora de Políticas, División de Justicia, ACLU.

""La National Black Justice Coalition cree que la pena de muerte es una idea antigua que debería dejarse en el último milenio. Ha habido demasiados casos de personas inocentes asesinadas en el corredor de la muerte debido a negligencia grave y desigualdades en nuestro sistema de justicia penal. Nuestro gobierno No debería decidir quién es ""redimible"", especialmente cuando los hechos del caso son demasiado a menudo incorrectos cuando se trata de personas de color y otras comunidades marginadas"". - Victoria Kirby York, directora ejecutiva adjunta, National Black Justice Coalition.

“A lo largo de la historia, las personas negras que fueron blanco de las fuerzas del orden y sin la garantía de un juicio justo han terminado desproporcionadamente en el corredor de la muerte, especialmente en los estados del sur profundo como Alabama, Georgia, Luisiana y Mississippi”. –Southern Poverty Law Center.

“Nos complace ver tanto interés y entusiasmo por seguir adelante con esta legislación. Mientras nos enfocamos en la misión crítica de nuestra nación de reforzar y expandir nuestro compromiso con una democracia representativa diversa y vibrante donde invertimos en las personas, vecindarios y comunidades saludables e insistimos en la responsabilidad del gobierno, la pena capital no tiene lugar en ese futuro. Agradecemos al congresista Espaillat por su liderazgo, visión y compromiso con la justicia”. - Diann Rust-Tierney, directora ejecutiva, Coalición Nacional para Abolir la Pena de Muerte.

“Acción contra la Pena de Muerte tiene el honor de respaldar al congresista Espaillat, quien nunca ha dudado en oponerse enfáticamente a la pena de muerte. Death Penalty Action se creó para movilizar a la gente a la acción, e instamos a todos a utilizar las herramientas en DeathPenaltyAction.org para contactar a sus miembros del congreso y solicitar apoyo para poner fin a las leyes federales y militares de pena de muerte en los primeros 100 días de la nueva administración"". - Abraham Bonowitz, director de Death Penalty Action.

""Derogar la pena de muerte es un paso esencial para comenzar a abordar el legado racista de nuestro sistema legal penal"". - Laura Porter, directora ejecutiva, 8th Amendment Project.

Strides in Closing the Digital Divide
Closing the digital divide is a challenge for American society in the 21st century that must be met. Internet connectivity brings with it economic growth, educational opportunities, individual quality of life, and many other assets, but rural areas lag behind urban ones in access to reliable internet service. Making the American dream available to all citizens requires building out internet infrastructure from sea to shining sea.
Fortunately, great strides in this effort have been made by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under the leadership of outgoing Chairman Ajit Pai. The FCC has paid attention to the needs of rural communities such as those found throughout Virginia’s Ninth Congressional District, targeting funding and supporting creative initiatives that will help more Americans obtain reliable and fast internet access.
One of these initiatives in our region has captured significant attention recently.
Wise County Public Schools will be the beneficiary of a program that uses low-orbit satellites to provide high-speed broadband in rural and isolated areas. Forty-five families in the county will receive free internet access through this technology.
The FCC has approved applications from various companies planning to use satellites to provide broadband access and has also awarded money to help these providers serve rural areas.
The difficulties of connecting Southwest Virginia are representative of the problems satellite broadband connectivity aims to fix: the traditional method of laying fiber optic cables is expensive in isolated areas with difficult terrain. Satellites present an alternative for getting these areas online.
I have supported the FCC’s move in this area, and I am pleased that some residents in our area will benefit directly from them in the immediate future.
The FCC has not only advanced innovative ways to close the digital divide, but it has supported them with unprecedented levels of funding.
Last year, the FCC held its Phase I auction for the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund, which will ultimately total a $20.4 billion effort. Phase I targets 10.4 million Americans in rural areas with no broadband access, and it prioritizes service at higher speeds.
In the jurisdictions of the Ninth District, 31,038 locations will be served and a total of $23,405,973.49 funded. These investments will make a substantial difference. Out of the 29 cities and counties making up the Ninth District, 22 of them received money, including $7,718,764.40 to Patrick County, $306,730.16 to Lee County, $256,562.20 to Montgomery County, and $33,632.30 to Craig County.
Phase II will focus on areas that are deemed partially served as well as any unserved areas left over from Phase I.
The FCC has also encouraged the use of telehealth, which has great potential to expand access and affordability in rural health care.
Since 2017, funding for the FCC’s Rural Health Care Program increased by 43 percent. The commission also allowed funding from previous years to carry forward, so the overall result was that funding for the program doubled from $400 million in 2017 to $802.7 million for the 2020 funding year.
The FCC also moved forward with the Connected Care Pilot Program, a step announced by FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr at the Tri-Area Community Health Center in Laurel Fork in 2019. The program is a $100 million initiative to support telehealth services to low-income Americans, including those in rural areas.
Quick action and flexibility provided by the FCC during the coronavirus pandemic has also been invaluable. In March, Chairman Pai launched the Keep Americans Connected Pledge asking providers not to cut broadband and telephone service during the pandemic. Over 800 companies made this commitment, including providers serving the Ninth District.
As hospital facilities turned their focus to responding to the coronavirus, the FCC launched a $200 million COVID-19 Telehealth Program so patients could receive health care in their homes or at mobile locations, ensuring they did not go without the care they needed.
Additional FCC actions during the pandemic included more funding and waiving regulations to assist schools and libraries with connectivity to continue providing services to students. As schools shifted to remote learning, these measures gave them a lifeline so students would not completely miss out on further education.
There is much to do still to close the digital divide. I know too many Ninth District residents lack the reliable broadband service they need. To get there, I hope the next FCC Chair adopts the same forward-thinking and innovative approach as Chairman Pai during his time leading the commission.

1/15/21 17:09,My Impeachment Remarks,"￼

January 15, 2021
Dear Lindsey,
 
This was a somber but incredibly important week for our nation. On Wednesday, my colleagues and I in the House of Representatives voted to impeach the president for his incitement of the violent insurrection that took place at the Capitol on January 6. We did this because Donald Trump’s behavior poses a clear and present danger to the American people—and he must be held accountable.
 
As a member of the Rules committee, I delivered remarks to my colleagues as we voted to bring the articles of impeachment to the House floor. They explain why I felt this vote was so important, and why we have an obligation to make clear to future generations that this behavior is anti-American, anti-democratic, and simply unacceptable. You can read those remarks below, or watch a video here. 
 
In just a few days, President-Elect Biden and Vice President-Elect Harris will be sworn into office, and I’m hopeful it will be the start of a new era of healing for our nation. I look forward to the weeks to come and the work ahead.
 
All the best,
Joe
 

 
  
Impeachment Remarks 
  
I thank my colleague Mr. Raskin, who has done so much to serve this country, even during a time of tremendous personal pain and loss, for introducing this resolution. And I thank you, Mr. Chairman for your steadfast leadership today and every day. 
 
Mr. Chairman, the members of this committee find ourselves yet again with a somber obligation before us. For the first time in the history of our republic, we face the decision to impeach a sitting President for the second time. While I am heartbroken for our nation that it has come to this, we have a Constitutional duty to hold the president accountable for his actions.
 
The events of the past week remain shocking, emotional, and painful for us as individuals and as a nation. The violent attack on January 6 led to the deaths of five Americans and the desecration of a building that is the very symbol of our democracy—a sacred space that represents the rule of law, the voice of the people, and the fundamental values we hold dear. Most shocking of all, it was incited by Donald Trump himself, to undermine and disrupt the counting of votes that will bring to a close his presidency.
 
Donald Trump’s actions and rhetoric clearly demonstrate that he is unfit for the Presidency. Last week we each took an oath to “preserve, protect and defend"" the “Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic,” and in doing so, to protect the American people from clear and present danger. That danger confronts us now. A dark, insidious, grave danger that threatens the foundation and the people of this grand republic.  To thwart this very real hazard President Trump must be removed from office using any means afforded to us by the Constitution. 
 
There can be no question that a President who not only abdicates his responsibility to protect his country but instead incites violence against it; who not only refuses to forcefully condemn those who seek to overthrow our government but actively encourages them; who time and time again calls upon our nation’s darkest demons instead of summoning our better angels—there can be no question that surely such a President is exactly the type of unchecked executive that our Founders had in mind when they entrusted the House of Representatives with the power of impeachment.
 
""Our president wants us here,"" the rioters and insurrectionists said as they violently sought to take over the seat of our government. They firmly believed, and he led them to believe that they were fighting for the President. In fact, he told them directly, minutes before the attack on the Capitol, ""After this, we’re going to walk down, and I’ll be there with you."" And they believed that because they have repeatedly been lied to and egged on—by a leader who care more about the preservation of his power and office than our national interests. The President directed them, ‘you have to show strength.  You have to be strong.’ After the mob attacked Capitol Police officers, using the American flag as a weapon, President Trump said, ‘we love you, you’re very special.’ 
 
In any other period, we would find the President’s behavior outside the bounds of moral and decent behavior.  But we have become almost numb to it. It has, for some, become normalized. But let’s acknowledge it, the rhetoric that led to this violence did not begin recently—nor is it poised to end. The President has continually reveled in the support he receives from the worst factions of America who spout hatred and he has repeatedly refused to condemn the violence of neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and anti-democratic traitors. We teach our children that words matter, but it is a lesson that gets harder and harder to teach when time and time again it is willfully defied by the leader of the highest office in the land.
 
So, let’s come together to make it clear to our children, our grandchildren, and to the generations to follow, that Donald Trump’s behavior is antithetical to American law, American democracy, and American values. We must make it clear to this President, and to all future presidents that we cannot and will not tolerate actions that endanger in the words of Jefferson, “life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness” for all Americans. 
 
And through all of this, let’s ensure one thing remains clear to our country and to those watching around the globe: our democracy is strong. It may bend, but it will not break.
 
As I close, I’m reminded that for those of us entrusted with the safety and security of our nation ""a good conscience,"" President Kennedy wisely observed is, ""our only sure reward"" and history will be ""the final judge of our deeds."" My friends, the time of good conscience is now.  Let’s act in defense of our nation, support this resolution, and earn the approving final judgment of history.
 
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Foxx Report
 
The nation and the world are reeling from the rioting and violence that occurred on January 6th in the United States Capitol. As law enforcement works to bring accountability and swift justice to the perpetrators involved that day, Congress must leave no stone unturned in its quest to examine this event. This tragedy must never happen again.
Joe Biden is the President-Elect. Period. I echo Leader McCarthy’s appeal to President Trump to call Joe Biden and acknowledge him on that basis. Many of my colleagues pointed to the process on January 6th as the day of “ultimate significance” – in the words of the late Justice Ginsburg.  Unfortunately, those words now carry increasing weight and infamy. Truly, the election process is over, and we need to unify. 
As Congress, the American people, and the nation seek justice, the current calls for a “snap” impeachment and unprecedented, supra-Constitutional remedies must cease. We cannot abridge the safeguards that are explicitly used to enshrine justice in the name of justice itself. Speaker Pelosi’s march towards this “snap” process would abridge House rules, all known precedents, principles of due process and rights to a trial, and could possibly run afoul of the Constitution.
If my Democrat colleagues are focused on moving the country forward, they should work with Republicans to find appropriate remedies that don’t jeopardize that aim. President-Elect Biden will be sworn in on January 20th, and we must ensure a smooth and orderly transition of power. Another round of impeachment moves the needle further away from that outcome. 
I Will Never Stop Defending Life
The sanctity of life must be respected, and any institutions or organizations that conduct operations contrary to the preservation and defense of life must be excluded from subsidized funding by taxpayers for abortion services.
In 1970, when the Title X Family Planning Program was created, Congress issued a strong rebuke against abortion providers by not allowing funding under the title to be used for programs where abortion is considered a method of family planning. Since then, the original intent behind the law has been quashed repeatedly. Title X funds have been contributed to employee salaries, facility costs, and medical supplies for abortion providers. This must be corrected immediately.
The Protect Life Rule was an important step to end this exploitation of the law, and the Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act will make sure taxpayer dollars don’t subsidize abortion providers under any future Administrations. I’m proud to introduce this legislation and have 84 cosponsors joining me in defending life.  New Scam Alert
There’s no doubt that 2020 was fraught with scams that have defrauded countless North Carolinians across the state. You’ve likely seen my weekly scam updates, and I can assure you that these updates will continue this year. You deserve information on how to protect yourselves and your families from these rogue actors, and I will always keep you up to date.
This week let’s focus on a new threat: fraudulent telephone calls from scammers claiming to be CDC officials. As the COVID-19 vaccine is being distributed, many North Carolinians have received telephone calls from scammers asking for donations to help fund the distribution and administration of vaccines. They’ve even gone so far as to change their caller ID to display “Centers for Disease Control” to mislead those they call. Further, scammers will go on to ask if you would be willing to pay to receive a vaccine. 
Here’s the truth: the vaccine is free to everyone and it is funded by taxpayer dollars. In some instances, healthcare providers may charge an administrative fee for a vaccine, but it should be reimbursed by both private and public insurance companies. Online pharmacies are NOT reliable sources for receiving a vaccine.
I urge you to visit the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services website to find out what the planned phases are for vaccine distribution and other important information.
Have a blessed weekend.
Sincerely,
￼

1/15/21 16:10,Transforming the face of the great outdoors,"￼
January 15, 2021
Dear Friend,
The livelihoods of people of color have long been rooted in the outdoors, but they haven't always had equitable access to public lands. I am proud that New Mexico outdoor equity advocates and community leaders are leading the way in breaking down some of these barriers with our state's first-of-its-kind Outdoor Equity Fund, which provides grant funding to nonprofits, local governments, and Tribes to purchase recreation equipment and cover the costs of transportation to access public lands and outdoor places.
This week, I welcomed the launch of Outdoor F.U.T.U.R.E., a national outdoor equity initiative created by Black, Indigenous, and leaders of color from states and organizations across the country. This coalition of racially and ethnically diverse organizations is leading a national initiative to transform the face of the great outdoors, and help me introduce national outdoor equity legislation to make our parks and public lands places that everyone can enjoy. I encourage you to read more about this exciting initiative in the article below from Backpacker.
I strongly believe that we must devote real resources to expanding opportunities for those in communities who have been historically excluded and ensure we are supporting the next generation of stewards of our air, land, water and wildlife.
Sincerely,
￼
MARTIN HEINRICH United States Senator

The Outdoor F.U.T.U.R.E. Initiative Wants to Make Outdoor Adventure Available to All
A new initiative launching this week seeks to create a program to fund outdoor recreational and educational activities for underserved youth around the United States.
Gabrielle Rabon Jan 14, 2021
Public lands may be open to all, but thanks to the cost of gear and difficulty of access, not everyone has the same opportunity to use them. This week marks the launch of a new initiative dedicated to bridging that gap at the root.
Launching on January 14, the Outdoor Fund for Underrepresented, Tribal, Urban, and Rural Equity, or Outdoor F.U.T.U.R.E. Initiative, plans to create a program to invest in organizations, states, and tribal nations that provide underserved youth across the country with meaningful outdoor recreational and educational opportunities. The funding will help these groups with necessary expenses such as transportation and gear.
Gabe Vasquez, a Las Cruces City Councilor and a leader of Outdoor F.U.T.U.R.E., says this is the perfect time to launch the campaign, which is made up of leaders from organizations like Latino Outdoors and Outdoor Afro. The initiative will kick off on January 14, less than a week before the inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, who made climate change, environmental protections, and racial justice linchpins of his campaign. And as the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic has limited how people can interact with one another, Vasquez says the outdoors have served as a ""saving grace"" for many.
""I think because our country is more aware of the voices of people of color. And I think with this initiative coming out, I see the possibility of more resources and funds coming towards this, because this is such a hot and heated topic right now,"" Jaylyn Gough, another leader of the Outdoor F.U.T.U.R.E. Initiative, says.
According to a July 2020 report from the Center for American Progress, ""more than 76 percent of people who live in low-income communities of color live in nature-deprived places."" Without money for transportation or necessary gear, community members are often left without access to outdoor recreation and education.
Gough, who is also the founder and executive director of Native Women's Wilderness, says there is also very little representation of these groups within the outdoor industry, which she says has been marketed primarily toward white people.
""One of the goals for the initiative is to round it out and give a new face, a new look, about who can be in the outdoors and what it can look like, what it should look like,"" Gough says.
Gough, who grew up on the Navajo Nation, hopes that by giving young Native people access to the outdoors, the initiative will not only encourage active lifestyles, but also bring them closer to their heritage through activities like hunting and gathering medicinal plants and herbs.
The Outdoor F.U.T.U.R.E. Initiative was in part inspired by the New Mexico Outdoor Equity Fund (OEF), which launched in July 2019. 
Vasquez, who co-authored the OEF, was excited to see the programs in rural, Native, and urban communities of New Mexico that applied for grants. However, due to limited funding, the OEF was only able to award grants to 25 of the 84 applicants. One of the goals of the Outdoor F.U.T.U.R.E. Initiative is to form a program that functions similarly on a national scale in the hopes of reaching more youth.
The initiative is currently funded by support from Outdoor Afro, Latino Outdoors, and the other organizations it draws its leaders from, but is also soliciting donations and seeking industry partners. Once the initiative has a foothold, Vasquez hopes that like the OEF it will use both public and private sources to fund its projects. In the team's push to secure public funding, it has a powerful backer in Senator Martin Heinrich (D-NM), who's working with the initiative to garner some of the support it needs in Congress.
""Outdoor opportunities in our parks and public lands should be accessible to all Americans regardless of wealth, where you grow up, or the color of your skin,"" said Heinrich in a statement provided to Backpacker. ""I look forward to working with this powerful national group of leaders from diverse backgrounds and communities to build on recent historic victories for conservation and make our parks and public lands places everyone can enjoy.""
For his part, Vasquez is excited that the initiative is being built ground-up, according to the needs that its founders see in their communities.
""I think many of us have really become accustomed to our voices and our experiences being tokenized in this space"" Vasquez says, ""and this is really an opportunity for our communities to create something and to lead the space.""

1/15/21 15:56,This week’s impeachment vote and COVID-19 updates ,"￼ 
  

Dear Neighbors,
I voted to impeach President Trump this week because he made it clear on January 6, 2021 that he is unfit to serve as President of the United States. The President called on domestic terrorists to come to Washington and encouraged them to attack the Capitol. As a result, five people are dead, including a Capitol Police officer from New Jersey. President Trump’s willful incitement of insurrection poses a clear and imminent threat to our country’s democracy. We will not tolerate anyone who seeks to use elected office to willfully support the overthrow of a government for the people and by the people. Read more here
I went to the Visiting Nurse Association of Central Jersey’s (VNACJ) Community Health Center in Asbury Park this week to provide an update on the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic. Community health centers like the one in Asbury Park are on the front line of the coronavirus pandemic and are working around the clock to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are effectively and efficiently distributed to our health care workers and vulnerable members of our community. Read more here
I also toured the new mega vaccination site at the New Jersey Convention and Exposition Center with Governor Phil Murphy in Edison. The site is one of six mega-sites in New Jersey designed to help accelerate COVID-19 vaccinations around the state. I’ll work with the incoming Biden Administration to ensure that New Jersey has the funding and support it needs to continue expanding vaccination efforts. Read more here 
Local COVID-19 Announcements
New Jersey residents aged 65 and older and individuals aged 16-64 with medical conditions deemed high risk by the Centers for Disease Control are now eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine.  Learn more and register at covidvaccine.nj.gov.
Small businesses can again apply for PPP loans. Contact your lender or go to SBA.gov/ppp for more information. 
Open enrollment for health insurance ends on January 31st. Need help enrolling? Contact a free, trained and certified assister in your area. You can find help here.

Hello Lindsey,
 
On Wednesday, January 6th, Congress gathered to fulfill our constitutional duty: tallying the Electoral College victory of President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris after a free and fair election. This is a largely ceremonial role for the Congress, one that sends a message to the world that democracy in the United States persists. 
 
But at a rally just a mile and a half down Pennsylvania Avenue, Donald Trump and his allies were stoking the anger of a violent mob. Donald Trump told the crowd, ‘We are going to have to fight much harder...you will never take back our country with weakness.’ The election, which this administration has said was the most secure in our history, was an ‘egregious assault on our democracy,’ according to Donald Trump. Vice President Pence, he said, ‘was going to have to come through for us.’ Trump then told this mob to ‘walk down to the Capitol.’
 
The signal was unmistakable: these thugs should stage a coup so Donald Trump can hang on to power. The people’s will be damned. 
 
This wasn’t a protest. This was an insurrection. This was a well-organized attack on our country that was incited by Donald Trump. Domestic terrorists broke in to the United States Capitol that day. And it’s a miracle more people didn’t die.
 
Rioters chanted ‘Hang Mike Pence’ as a noose and gallows were built a stone’s throw from the Capitol steps. Capitol police officers were beaten and sprayed with pepper spray. Attackers hunted down lawmakers to hold them hostage or worse. 
 
As my colleagues and I were being evacuated to safety, I will never, ever forget what I saw when I looked into the eyes of these attackers: I saw evil. 
 
Our country came under attack, not from a foreign nation but from within.These were not protesters. These were not patriots. These were traitors. Domestic terrorists. And they were acting under the orders of Donald Trump. 
 
Some have suggested that we just move on from this horror. But to gloss over it would be an abdication of our duty. Others have talked about unity. But we can’t have unity without truth and accountability.
 
When we have seen this happen in other countries, we have risen up and we have spoken out.  But that’s not all – we have also taken action. Why would Congress do anything less when Donald Trump brings that kind of hate and violence to the seat of our government? 
 
 
￼
 
 
 
Our beacon of democracy became the sight of a vicious attack.
 
It’s impossible for me to fully capture the reverence I have for the United States Capitol. I worked on these grounds starting back when I was an intern for Senator George McGovern in 1977. 
 
Since that time, I have done everything from working as staffer for Congressman Moakley to being elected to the House of Representatives myself. 
 
But that internship will always be the high point of my life. Coming here for the first time, walking in these hallowed halls, and seeing the glory of American democracy up close.
 
The idea that someone would incite an out of control mob of homegrown fascists and domestic terrorists to desecrate the People’s House fills me with a deep sadness for our country.The contempt these people had for our democracy and our freedom fills me with horror. And what Donald Trump did, encouraging them, fills me with rage.
 
Every moment Donald Trump is in the White House, our nation – our freedom – is in danger. He must be held to account for the attack on our capitol that he organized and incited, which is why I voted yes on the article of impeachment. 
 
The damage the United States Capitol building sustained can be repaired. But if we don’t hold Donald Trump accountable, the damage done to our nation could be irreversible.
 
Sincerely, 
￼
James P. McGovern 
Member of Congress

Dear friend,
After another tumultuous week in Washington, I wanted to check in with you to provide an update on what I’ve been working on, and remind you of the services my office can assist you with. 
Last week, I was on the House Floor when domestic terrorists, incited by President Trump, attacked the Capitol. As we learn more about this evolving situation, it is clear that their plans involved using violence to try to overturn the results of a free and fair election. Those who participated in this attempted coup must be held responsible and I will do everything in my power to ensure a thorough investigation is conducted. I signed onto my colleague Cori Bush’s resolution that would ensure any Members of Congress who participated in, or otherwise incited, the deadly insurrection last Wednesday are held accountable. 
The imminent threat of violence––even from Members of Congress––must be addressed. That’s why I joined my colleagues in signing onto a letter requesting that passing through magnetometers outside the House floor remain a permanent requirement for Members of Congress.
￼
On Wednesday, for the first time in American history, the President of the United States was impeached for a second time. This bipartisan vote sent a clear signal that no one, not even Donald Trump, is above the law. Listen to my floor speech here.
￼
House Speaker Pelosi announced I would serve our nation as an Impeachment Manager for the upcoming Senate trial. This is a solemn responsibility and not one that I take lightly. I spoke with NPR’s Mary Louise Kelly yesterday to share more about the upcoming Senate trial.
As we continue to navigate these challenging times, my staff and I can support you with a variety of issues including small business questions, grant assistance, unemployment, veteran’s issues, and more. You can visit my website to get in touch with my staff or call my office at (510) 370-3322. 
As a reminder, California’s health insurance marketplace, Covered California, will remain open for enrollment until January 31st. Covered California and Medi-Cal use the same application. Once you apply, you’ll find out which program you qualify for. Some households qualify for both and coverage may be more affordable than you think. 
I understand how difficult these past few weeks have been. President Donald Trump betrayed his sacred promise to the American people, and has unleashed vitriol and violence on our nation like we’ve never seen. Better days are ahead and in less than one week, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be sworn into office. The road ahead is long, but we will all come out of this stronger and more resilient than ever. 
Keep the faith. 
Sincerely,
￼

Jill Jackson, Morris Udall and Campbell Soup

“When I attempted suicide and I didn’t succeed,” Jill Jackson said, “I knew for the first time unconditional love—which God is. You are totally loved, totally accepted, just the way you are. In that moment I was not allowed to die, and something happened to me, which is very difficult to explain. I had an eternal moment of truth, in which I knew I was loved, and I knew I was here for a purpose.” Eleven years later she and her husband of six years Sy Miller penned the hymn “Let there be peace on earth.”  It’s been playing on loop in my head this week in Washington – actually, just one line from it, “Let there be peace on earth and let it begin with me.”
During a committee hearing the late Congressman Morris Udall once said, “It is true that everything has been said, but not everyone has said it.” In this day and age, when not only do people lust for their 15 minutes of fame, more and more of them seek their 15 minutes 15 times a day. The key here is to get a sound bite of yourself saying something profound that you can use in your next campaign. And all you have to do is simply say something more outrageous than the Congressman that spoke just before you. May I remind you that during the four hours of debate this week on invoking the 25th Amendment and Impeachment - debates that included lots of screaming and name calling not one mind or vote was changed. This is standard fare in Congress. 99.99999% of the debates you watch on C-Span have zero effect on changing one mind or vote on the issue being discussed. But boy does it make for some good clips you can use in your next Campaign.
At the apartment I stay at while in Washington, I’ve become very adept with a microwave oven and a saucepan. I can heat up some mean Campbell soup in that saucepan. I like to see those first few bubbles before it breaks into a full boil. Those little bubbles mean it’s good and hot. However, if Investigation Discovery has distracted me and I go back to find my soup in a full boil I panic and turn the heat down. It’s time to turn down the heat in Washington and work on loving our neighbors and not hating them. ‘Let there be peace and let it begin with me’ - too aspirational probably but if I can be a little part of turning down the heat in Washington you’ve got my word, I will do just that. And in a tip of my hat to Mo Udall, if you see a quote from me, I was mis-quoted because I didn’t say anything. Now back to working on good bipartisan legislation, helping Mark with renewing his girlfriend’s passport, helping Jim cut through the red tape and get him into the Veterans Affairs Hospital before it’s too late and oh, yeah Craig’s client really needs for the Small Business Administration to decide on that case one way or the other. 
‘And now watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat.‘ A.K.A. What I’ll be working on in the 117th Congress. One of my top priorities in Congress has always been improving access to broadband in the more rural areas in my district. I constantly hear from frustrated folks who have extremely slow internet connectivity or no connection at all. In a time where Americans are working, attending school, shopping, and seeing their doctors from home, it is more important than ever to ensure everyone has access to adequate broadband services. During the last Congress, I worked across the aisle on legislation to improve the accuracy of broadband maps and hold telecommunications companies accountable if they purposefully fabricated those maps. The first step in ensuring rural communities have adequate broadband access is finding out who has no access at all. Now that we’ve worked to make broadband maps more accurate, we need to work hard to get access to these rural areas. I enjoy a very good reputation with my Democratic colleagues, and I look forward to working with them to pass legislation to improve rural broadband.
Lifting up rural communities that often feel left behind by the government is a crucial part of bridging the partisan divide. That is why many of my priorities strive to improve the quality of life in rural communities. Another legislative item that I was able to work across the aisle on last Congress was the Success for Rural Students and Communities Act. Language from this bill was included in the latest funding package and creates a grant program to promote postsecondary enrollment and completion rates for rural students. While rural students graduate high school at the same or higher rate than their urban counterparts, their college attendance rate is significantly lower. Legislation like this ensures individuals living in rural communities are on an equal playing field with the rest of the nation. It continues to be my goal to work on legislation similar to this, that would ensure rural communities are not left behind.
Another one of my priorities that I have been pushing for years that would improve the quality of life in both rural and urban communities is a bipartisan infrastructure package. If there is one thing that both Democrats and Republicans can agree on, it’s improving our nation’s infrastructure. Unfortunately, Democrats refused to work with Republicans on infrastructure during the Trump Administration but I’m hopeful that they will be more amenable to a compromise after January 20, 2021.
In order for our country to truly heal, Democrats and Republicans in Congress need to work together and pass bipartisan legislation that will benefit everyone. I can promise you that will not happen until we turn down the heat in Washington. I ran on bringing strong conservative principles to Congress and I will continue to fight to ensure those principles are represented in the legislation we pass.

1/15/21 13:53,Senator Rosen's Senate Briefing," ￼ 

  
Dear Fellow Nevadan, 
Welcome to this week’s edition of the Senate Briefing. There has been a lot of news these last few weeks, and our nation is in deep distress. I want you to know that I am working to address the challenges that the nation is facing, and am committed to defending our democracy in the days ahead.  As we begin to turn the page, I want to make sure you are up-to-date on some important topics like health care open enrollment, which ends today, and the Paycheck Protection Program, which is officially re-open! 

￼
This is the final day of health care open enrollment in Nevada! That means today is the last day you can enroll in a new health care plan or change your existing plan for 2021 if you get your coverage on the individual market. Find a plan that works for you and your family at www.NevadaHealthLink.com or by calling 800-547-2927. 
￼





￼

The Paycheck Protection Program was a lifeline to thousands of Nevada small businesses last year, and I’m pleased to announce that it has re-opened for new borrowers and certain existing PPP borrowers looking for a second forgivable loan.  Learn more and apply for a PPP loan by clicking HERE.   If you have additional questions about small business assistance, check out my website’s bilingual COVID-19 Small Business Assistance page. 
￼
Just this week, I’m proud that two bipartisan bills I co-led have become law!  The Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism Act, a bipartisan bill I co-led with Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), will elevate the Special Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism to the level of Ambassador-at-Large to ensure the State Department has the tools and resources to combat rising anti-Semitism around the world.
￼
The Advancing Research to Prevent Suicide Act, a bipartisan bill I co-led with Senator John Cornyn (R-TX), supports research on suicide treatment and prevention to address the rising rates of suicide across our nation.
￼

1/15/21 13:01,Blaine’s Bulletin: Overcoming Times of Challenge and Controversy,"￼ 
January 15, 2020
For Immediate Release | Contact: Georgeanna Sullivan (202) 225-2956 

BLAINE’S BULLETIN: OVERCOMING TIMES OF CHALLENGE AND CONTROVERSY
“The ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.” (Martin Luther King, Jr., 1963)
While the circumstances we face today are much different than 1963, Dr. King’s words still ring true. Over the last year, our nation has endured more than our fair share of adversity. We have experienced a once in a lifetime pandemic that has claimed American lives, caused unemployment rates to reach Great Depression levels, kept students out of school and shuttered businesses. We have seen political unrest in the forms of violent protests in cities throughout the country and attacks on the men and women in law enforcement who risk their lives daily to protect our communities. And most recently, the horrific scenes in the United States Capitol. There is no doubt these are times of challenge and controversy. Now we must decide where we go from here.  
If you look at the actions of the House of Representatives over the past week, it’s clear some of my colleagues remain intent on divisiveness and chaos. On Wednesday the House voted on a non-binding resolution about the 25thAmendment. Resolutions like this have no way of becoming law.  In fact, they’re not designed to become law. When passed they do not get sent to the Senate nor do they change anything.  It is simply a public statement.  This particular statement was designed to remind the public of last week’s events with the hope of scoring political points. After that, we voted on another round of impeachment. While the FBI and intelligence community are still conducting their investigations and new evidence is coming to light every day, the Speaker rushed articles through the House skipping months of committee processes and review.  There is no benefit to this. Regardless of the House’s actions we will have a new President and administration next week, long before the Senate finishes it’s trial, if they have one at all.  At a time of challenge and controversy, the Speaker chose more chaos and political unrest over the greater good.  
As your Representative, my priorities for the coming year include doing everything in my power to get all Missourians healthy and our economy fully open. Missouri has already done a great job of rolling out the vaccine and another phase is set to begin soon. To find out when you are eligible to receive the vaccine and register, please visit covidvaccine.mo.gov. This should be the final piece of the puzzle in allowing everyone to go back to regular life without fear. Our students and teachers will be able to return to the classroom fulltime and parents can retire from their new part-time jobs as home educators. 
While our economic and small business recovery has outperformed many states, it remains one of my main focuses. My new position as the leading Republican on the House Small Business Committee has given me a larger platform to do even more to help our businesses be successful – not just stay afloat. Congress reupped the Paycheck Protection Program in the latest COVID relief package and I am pleased to report the Small Business Administration started accepting applications this week. For any business owners who would like to apply for either a first or second round PPP loan, please visit sba.gov.
It is no secret I favor smaller government with less regulations, but with the new Administration will come a new regulatory regime that will most certainly seek to increase government control. We will see proposals to increase taxes on small businesses and socially motivated restrictions on financial institutions that will increase the cost, and in some cases completely eliminate, banking services which slows down economic growth. My job and the job of my committee will be to push back on every regulation and action that threatens our ability to create jobs, pay employees, and succeed. Our economic freedom is what sets us apart from the rest of the world and it must be maintained. 
Unfortunately, 2021 has picked up where 2020 left off. There are plenty of reasons to be frustrated. But America is resilient. We have overcome every challenge that has been in our way and come out stronger on the other side. This year will be no different. Brighter days are ahead, and it starts right now.

Dear Friends, 
 
Wednesday was a dark day for our country. None of us wanted to spend our time impeaching Trump once again, but we had no choice. The events of January 6th threatened not only our democracy and the lives of thousands, but also the important work of Congress. 
 
Now that the House has done our job to hold Trump accountable, we must redouble our efforts for the American people.  
 
The coronavirus still poses a very real threat. Thousands of people are dying every day. We have to improve the disastrous response of the Trump administration that has resulted in the United States having the worst performance of any developed country in the world. While we have a vaccine, we're still dealing with the lingering consequences of Trump's incompetence.
 
Under President-elect Biden, the federal government will finally have a unified plan to defeat the pandemic. It will respect science. It will counter the skepticism and delusion that started at the top when Trump, who couldn't be bothered to fight the virus, spread misinformation resulting in the politicization of public health and attacks on public health workers. 
 
We also need to stop shortchanging healthcare workers by giving them the support they deserve and the resources they need to do their job. 
 
The pandemic has stretched so many parts of our society to the breaking point, including hospitals, state and local governments, and essential workers who are at risk. Much-needed relief has been paralyzed by Mitch McConnell and Republicans in the Senate. By acting now, we can help desperate families with money for food, housing, and utilities.
 
As the Trump wrecking crew leaves office, Congress should also be prepared to swiftly invoke the congressional review process to repeal the worst abuses inflicted on the American people, our institutions and the environment. It is imperative to limit the damage and show the American public how we will use the powers of government in ways that they are intended. 
 
Finally, we should begin work immediately repairing the damage to our democracy. When Democrats regained control in the House of Representatives in 2018, we quickly passed legislation to protect, expand and enhance our democratic institutions, particularly voting. 
 
This should be the first order of business as the evidence of efforts to undercut voting is so clear for all to see. 
 
We need to increase voting rights to minimize the ability of partisan local officials to undercut them. We should strengthen and clarify the right to vote by mail, the most secure and convenient way for voters to make their voices heard at election time. It must be safe, convenient and verifiable in every state by both Republicans and Democrats. This is after all, how our military around the world exercises their right to vote
 
We must make sure that this fundamental right is protected for anyone who wants, as Trump himself did, to vote at home. 
 
This is just a start. I am excited about what’s ahead. I’m energized by what we've witnessed around the country as people stand up for their communities. I’m determined that we don't waste a minute of the opportunity that the voters have given us to fight for them and our democracy.
  
Courage,
￼

1/15/21 12:01,New Round of PPP Loans Available to Small Businesses,"  
￼
 
 Home | Newsroom | Helping Iowans | Contact 

New Round of PPP Loans Available to Small Businesses 
As a member of the Senate Small Business Committee, I helped create the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) – a forgivable loan to help small businesses survive the COVID-19 pandemic. I was proud to help deliver relief to more than 60,000 Iowa small businesses through the first installment of the PPP. And, just recently, I helped bolster the PPP in the latest relief package.  

First-Draw Loans 
The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has re-opened the application portal for small businesses to apply for first-draw PPP loans to help cover employee payroll, mortgage and rent, utility expenses, and more.    Small businesses that did not receive a PPP loan prior to August 8, 2020, and employ 500 people or less, are eligible to apply for first-draw loans through March 31, 2021.  

Second-Draw Loans 
Small businesses may also apply for second-draw PPP loans. Entities that previously received a first-draw loan are eligible for a second-draw loan through March 31, 2021 based on the following criteria: 
	•	The business has used the full amount of a first-draw loan for authorized uses, including payroll costs, mortgage and rent, utility expenses, and more
	•	The business employs 300 people or less
	•	The business experienced a 25% reduction in gross receipts in any given quarter during 2020, compared to the same quarter in 2019 
	•	The business has not permanently closed 

How to Apply 
The PPP application portal is currently open for small businesses to apply through lenders with less than $1 billion in assets or through Community Financial Institutions, which include Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), Certified Development Companies (CDCs) and Microloan Intermediaries.   On Tuesday, January 19, the portal will open for eligible small businesses to apply for PPP loans through all participating lenders, including any federally insured depository institution, federally insured credit union, and Farm Credit System institution. Be sure to contact your local lender to confirm if they are participating.    Visit the SBA website for more information and to download the first-draw and second-draw loan applications.    As always, my staff and I are here to help if you have any questions, so please do not hesitate to reach out for assistance.

GETTING BACK TO THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS

The attack on our Capitol last week has highlighted the urgent need for leaders on both sides of the aisle to end the extreme rhetoric, end the political games, and come together to help unite our country. The attack should never have happened, and we must launch a full investigation into the security failure so that we can take appropriate action. 

However, this week my Democratic colleagues launched a rushed impeachment process just one week before President Trump’s term ends that will do more to divide our country than unite us. This vote was called without one single hearing in the Judiciary Committee, and in the Senate, a trial will not even begin before President Trump is out of office! This is nothing more than political messaging, and we must get back to conducting the People’s business.

We should be focused on pressing policy issues to help the American people, like growing the economy, creating jobs and defeating COVID-19. In order for the nation to unify and heal after last week’s assault on our Capitol, the best way forward is through a peaceful transfer of power next week, which is why I opposed their impeachment efforts.

￼

Paycheck Protection Program Reopens 

￼

Thanks to the most recent COVID-19 relief package passed in Congress in December, this week the Paycheck Protection has reopened in a sequential fashion:
	•	On Monday, January 11th: PPP reopened for small businesses and other newly eligible entities applying for their first round of funding. Specifically, the Small Business Administration and the Department of the Treasury reserved this opening for Community Financial Institutions (CFIs) to submit PPP loan applications. 
	•	On Wednesday, January 13th: PPP reopened for eligible small businesses and entities interested in receiving a second loan. The SBA and Treasury again reserved this opening period for CFIs to submit applications. 
	•	TODAY, Friday, January 15th: All lenders with $1 billion or less in assets will be allowed to submit applications for First and Second Draw PPP loans. 
	•	On Tuesday, January 19th: PPP will reopen to all lenders, no matter their size. 
For more information, the SBA has put together a helpful overview here.

Update on Economic Impact Payments

The second round of Economic Impact Payments are currently being distributed to eligible taxpayers as quickly as possible. The following information is courtesy of the IRS:
	•	Direct deposits. For those who have provided their direct deposit information to the IRS through either their most recent tax returns or through the Get My Payment tool during the first round, continue to watch your bank accounts for a deposit in coming days. The IRS emphasizes that the information taxpayers see in the Get My Payment tool, including account numbers and potential deposit dates, may continue to display unfamiliar account numbers as the IRS continues to work through and update this issue. No action is necessary for taxpayers as this work continues; they do not need to call the IRS, their tax provider or their financial institution. 
	•	Mail. Some people will receive their second Economic Impact Payment by mail, either as a paper check or in the form of a debit card. For people in this group, the IRS urges people to carefully watch their mail for either of these during January. Additional information is available on IRS.gov. 
	•	Tax returns. While the IRS continues to closely work with industry partners to quickly deliver more Economic Impact Payments, the IRS reminds eligible taxpayers who don't receive a payment – or the full amount– that they can claim the Recovery Rebate Credit when they file their 2020 tax return. Taxpayers in this situation are urged to file electronically with direct deposit to ensure their tax refund – and their stimulus payment – reach them as soon as possible. 
For more information, please visit the IRS website here.

￼

Voting is the most important tool in which we shape our republic. Too many Americans have lost faith in the integrity of our elections, and it is incumbent on leaders at all levels to work together to implement safeguards to strengthen and restore faith in the process.

That’s why I’m proud to be an original cosponsor of the Save Democracy Act, legislation that will help to ensure that only legal votes are counted through necessary reforms to registering voters, casting ballots and tabulating ballots.

Bergman Gives Update on Great Lakes Efforts
 Today, Rep. Jack Bergman shared news of key steps taken to further ensure the health, beauty, and prosperity of our Great Lakes. Michigan’s First District features the most coastline of any Congressional District in the contiguous United States, and Rep. Bergman has made conservation a top priority on behalf of all who live, work, and play on our Great Lakes. 
Bergman noted, “The past few months have yielded some major accomplishments for protecting our Great Lakes, such as in the fight against invasive species - particularly Asian Carp. Following bipartisan work between myself and other stakeholders in Congress, we’re making real progress with results-driven programs and projects that will safeguard the future of our natural resources for many generations.""  Below are recent Great Lakes developments, which Rep. Bergman helped lead from the federal level:
Bipartisan Letter Urging Army Corps to Prioritize Great Lakes Projects in 2021
As a member of the House Great Lakes Task Force, Rep. Bergman and his colleagues called on the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to take up important initiatives outlined by the Task Force as the Corps develops its fiscal year (FY) 2021 work plan. With the enactment of key authorizations and funding provided by Congress at the end of 2020, the bipartisan group identified continued Soo Locks improvements, Asian Carp prevention, and implementation of both the Great Lakes Resiliency Study and the Great Lakes Fishery and Ecosystem Restoration program as top priorities.
You can read the full letter here, which the Task Force sent on January 8th.
Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Reauthorization and Advancements
On January 5th, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act of 2019 was signed into law. The reauthorization will positively impact efforts to combat pollution and toxic contamination, crack down on the advance of invasive species, and preserve the Great Lakes as an oasis for wildlife and economic opportunity. Rep. Bergman proudly helped introduce and advance this legislation, which will extend the Initiative through 2026.   The authorized funding level for the GLRI will be boosted to $375 million in Fiscal Year 2022, and will see incremental increases of $25 million per year until it reaches $475 million in FY 2026. The recent FY21 government appropriations bill funded the GLRI at $330 million. 
Additionally, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on January 14th announced the milestone of restoring 100 beneficial uses at various Great Lakes Areas of Concern, which is a critical measurement of success for the public-private partnerships utilized by the GLRI to grow economic opportunity in nearby communities. 
For more information on the GLRI, visit: https://www.glri.us/
Interstate Agreement Reached to Block Asian Carp
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on January 6th announced an agreement between Michigan and Illinois to commit resources and share responsibilities on the Great Lakes Mississippi River Interbasin Study – Brandon Road Project. Following Rep. Bergman’s successful advocacy to authorize the Project and increase the federal cost share from 65 to 80 percent in the newly enacted 2020 Water Resources Development Act, these promising next steps will bring us closer to constructing mechanisms at Brandon Road to stop the advance of Asian Carp into Lake Michigan.

The Huizenga Huddle: January 15, 2021
 

An infamous start to the 117th Congress 

After examining the Article of Impeachment put forward by House Democrats, I do not believe their evidence rises to the constitutional threshold of high crimes and misdemeanors. 

On Wednesday, I voted against impeachment. What took place on January 6th was a tragedy. Violence has no place in our political system. With days remaining in President Trump’s term, impeachment further divides our nation and prevents us from coming together. 

Following Wednesday's vote, I took to Facebook Live to explain why I voted against impeachment. I encourage you to watch the video by clicking on the photo below. 

￼

This definitely isn't the start to the 117th Congress that I had hoped for. The events that took place on January 6th serve as a stark reminder that we have lost the notion of civility. 

Violence is not how we resolve our differences in America and this isn’t the West Michigan way. Violence in all fashions must be condemned. Those who broke the law need to be held accountable.  There is also an important distinction that must be made. There is a big difference between a peaceful protest and storming the Capitol Building. 

On January 7th, I joined Justin Barclay on WOOD Radio in a long form interview to discuss the events that I witnessed and how we move our nation forward. You can click on the image below to hear our conversation.

Great News for the Great Lakes  Over the last several weeks, there have been several major developments regarding efforts to safeguard and restore the Great Lakes.   GLRI Renewal and Expansion: On January 5th, the President signed a five year extension of the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) into law. As Co-Chair of the House Great Lakes Task Force, I helped champion passage of this bipartisan legislation through the House. This new law will protect, restore, and strengthen both the ecology and the economy of the Great Lakes for years to come. To lean more about this important win for West Michigan, click here.   Making A Difference Across Michigan: On December 29th, the EPA announced the successful completion of a $6.6 million GLRI project in Muskegon and a $2.9 million GLRI project in Detroit.  These are critical steps forward in the effort to clean up legacy pollution and restore both Muskegon Lake and the Detroit riverfront. A recent study by Grand Valley State University found the GLRI-led effort to restore Muskegon Lake has increased recreational spending by $27.9 million per year. For more information on the restoration of Muskegon Lake as well as the research from Grand Valley State University, click here. To learn more about the GLRI, click on the photo below. 
￼
Improving Information: On December 31st, President Trump signed the Great Lakes Environmental Sensitivity Index Act of 2020 into law. I was the lead republican sponsor of this bipartisan effort in the House. While the Great Lakes hold over 20% of the world's freshwater, provide drinking water to more than 48 million people, support over 1.3 million jobs, and generate billions upon billions of dollars in economic activity, the environmental maps for the Great Lakes region have not been updated in more than 20 years. This law will help us update these critical maps every seven years so we can better protect public infrastructure from erosion, properly plan in case of an emergency, and more effectively restore habitat for endangered species. You can read more about this new law here.
Asian Carp Update: On January 7th, an agreement was announced between Michigan and Illinois to move forward on the Brandon Road Lock and Dam System. While still in the very early stages, this is a significant step forward in the effort to protect the Great Lakes from Asian carp. In order to build on this progress, I believe it is critical that funding for Brandon Road be included in the 2021 U.S. Army Corps of Engineers work plan to protect the Great Lakes and move the project into its next phase.   Standing Up For West Michigan Agriculture  On Tuesday morning, I spoke in support of West Michigan blueberry growers during a United States International Trade Commission (ITC) hearing on unsavory blueberry import practices. Michigan growers, family farms, and processors are currently being undercut by foreign imports specifically designed to maximize damage to American farmers. My testimony follows up on a bipartisan letter I led to the ITC on December 22nd with several of my Michigan colleagues detailing the economic toll these trade practices have had on Michigan growers. You can read the letter here.  
￼

Last month, I was happy to announce a significant win for Michigan cherry growers and processors. By working with the US Department of Agriculture and the Cherry Marketing Institute (CMI) my office was able to help facilitate conversations that led to the end of a 15% tariff on U.S. tart cherry juice. 

Estimates from the CMI show that 75% of tart cherries produced in the United States are grown here in Michigan. Additionally, projections show that exporting tart cherry juice to Taiwan has the potential to reach over $1 million. This means more economic opportunity for growers, processors, and families across Michigan. 

When our farmers and growers are able to compete on a level playing field, Michigan families benefit. This announcement is great news for Michigan cherry growers and the agricultural community as a whole. To learn more about this new opportunity click here. 

Serving West Michigan

I am honored to have the opportunity to serve West Michigan in the 117th Congress. While our nation faces many challenges, I am thankful to have the support of my family and our community to make the Second District, Michigan, and America an even better place to call home.

PRESS RELEASE
For Immediate Release
January 15, 2021


NYS COVID Rent Relief Program Accepting Applications Through February 1, 2021

The New York State Division of Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) has reopened the COVID Rent Relief Program and will be accepting new applications through Monday, February 1, 2021


NEW YORK, NY -- The New York State Division of Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) has reopened the COVID Rent Relief Program and will be accepting new applications through Monday, February 1, 2021.  The program’s eligibility criteria have been expanded to provide rent relief to more New Yorkers.  Individuals who applied during the previous application window and were denied, do not need to apply again.  Those applications are being reviewed again.  Additionally, applications from individuals who have not received a response from the HCR are being reviewed under the new criteria. 

If approved, applicants will receive a subsidy for the difference between a household’s rent burden on March 1, 2020 and the household’s rent burden in the months of April, May, June, and July 2020.  The subsidy is a one-time payment available for a maximum of four months of rent, up to 125% of the Fair Market Rents (FMR) for that household’s area.  HCR will send payments directly to the applicant’s landlord.

To qualify, applicants must meet all of the eligibility requirements:

• You must be a renter with primary residence in New York State.

• Before March 7, 2020, and at the time of application, your household income (including unemployment benefits) must have been below 80% of the area median income, adjusted for household size.  You can find your county’s area median income, based on your household size, here. 

• Households must be “rent-burdened” during the months they are applying for assistance between April 1 to July 31, 2020.  A household is rent-burdened if they are paying more than 30 percent of their income towards housing costs. 

• You must have lost income during the period of April 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020.

Detailed information about the program, including eligibility criteria, the application process, the documents that will be requested as part of the application process, and answers to frequently answered questions are available on HCR's website.  Additionally, HCR is operating a special helpline to answer questions and provide assistance with the application process.  For help, applicants can contact HCR’s COVID Rent Relief Extension Program Call Center for assistance at 1-833-499-0318 or covidrentrelief@hcr.ny.gov.  Call Center representatives are available Monday through Friday 8:30am – 5:00pm. 

If you are chosen to receive a rental subsidy through this program, New York State will cover the difference between your household's rent burden on March 1, 2020 and your household's increase in rent burden during the period your household is applying for assistance.  Households can apply for up to four months of assistance for the months of April 2020 through July 2020.  Tenants do not have to be behind in their rent to receive assistance.  Tenants who are current on their rent payments can have funds applied towards a credit for future months.  The rent subsidy payment will go directly to your landlord. 

Deadline to submit your application is Monday, February 1, 2021. 

Apply online today or visit NYS Homes and Community Renewal for more information.

La División de Renovación de Viviendas y Comunidades del Estado de Nueva York (HCR) ha reabierto el Programa de Ayuda para el Alquiler por COVID y aceptará nuevas solicitudes hasta el lunes 1 de febrero de 2021


NEW YORK, NY -- La División de Renovación de Viviendas y Comunidades del Estado de Nueva York (HCR) ha reabierto el Programa de Ayuda para el Alquiler por COVID y aceptará nuevas solicitudes hasta el lunes 1 de febrero de 2021.  Los criterios de elegibilidad del programa se han ampliado para proporcionar alivio de alquiler a más neoyorquinos.  Las personas que presentaron una solicitud durante el período de solicitud anterior y fueron denegadas, no necesitan presentar una nueva solicitud.  Estas solicitudes están siendo revisadas nuevamente.  Las solicitudes de personas que aún no han recibido una respuesta de HCR se están revisando según los nuevos criterios.

Si es aprobada, los solicitantes recibirán un subsidio por la diferencia entre la carga del alquiler del hogar el 1 de marzo de 2020 y la carga del alquiler del hogar en los meses de abril, mayo, junio y julio de 2020.  El subsidio es un pago único disponible para un máximo de cuatro meses de alquiler, hasta el 125% de los Alquileres Justos de Mercado (FMR) que se pagan en el área de esa vivienda.  HCR enviará los pagos directamente al casero del solicitante.

Para calificar, los solicitantes deben cumplir con todos los requisitos de elegibilidad:

• Debe ser un inquilino con residencia principal en el Estado de Nueva York.

• Antes del 7 de marzo de 2020 y en el momento de la solicitud, los ingresos de su hogar (incluidos los beneficios de desempleo) deben haber estado por debajo del 80% del ingreso medio del área, ajustado al tamaño del hogar. Puede encontrar el ingreso medio del área de su condado, según el tamaño de su hogar, aquí.

• Los hogares deben estar “sobrecargados por el alquiler” durante los meses en que solicitan asistencia entre el 1 de abril y el 31 de julio de 2020.  Un hogar está sobrecargado por el alquiler si paga más del 30 por ciento de sus ingresos para los costos de vivienda.

• Usted debe haber perdido ingresos durante el período del 1 de abril de 2020 al 31 de julio de 2020.

La información detallada sobre el programa, incluidos los criterios de elegibilidad, el proceso de solicitud, los documentos que se solicitarán como parte del proceso de solicitud y las respuestas a las preguntas frecuentes están disponibles en el sitio web de HCR. Además, HCR tiene en funcionamiento una línea de ayuda especial para responder preguntas y brindar asistencia con el proceso de solicitud. Para obtener ayuda, los solicitantes pueden comunicarse con el Centro de Llamadas del Programa Extendido de Ayuda para el Alquiler por COVID de HCR al 1-833-499-0318 o covidrentrelief@hcr.ny.gov.  Los representantes del Centro de Llamadas están disponibles de lunes a viernes de 8:30 am a 5:00 pm.

Si es elegido para recibir un subsidio de alquiler a través de este programa, el Estado de Nueva York cubrirá la diferencia entre la carga del alquiler de su hogar el 1 de marzo de 2020 y el aumento de la carga del alquiler de su hogar durante el período en que su hogar está solicitando asistencia. Los hogares pueden solicitar hasta cuatro meses de asistencia para los meses de abril de 2020 a julio de 2020. Los inquilinos no tienen que estar atrasados en el pago del alquiler para recibir asistencia. A los inquilinos que están al día en sus pagos de alquiler se les pueden aplicar fondos para un crédito para meses futuros. El pago del subsidio de alquiler irá directamente a su casero.

La fecha límite para enviar su solicitud es el lunes, 1 de febrero de 2021.

Second Round of Economic Impact Payments
In December Congress passed, and the President signed into law, a COVID Relief Package which provided an additional stimulus payment from the IRS of $600 per person (but less for families within the incomes over $150,000). The IRS is expected to directly deposit these checks into accounts starting in early January. 
 
While I fought to secure more than $600 and voted for the increase to $2,000, passing something now is better than not passing anything at all. We will need to do more in 2021 and I'm optimistic that under the incoming Biden administration, we will take the additional steps necessary to meet our country's economic and medical needs.

James Hogge 231-944-7633


Bergman Shares New Update on PPP Reopening and Guidance 
 
The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) continues to reopen in a sequential fashion.  This past Monday, January 11, 2021, the PPP reopened for small businesses and other newly eligible entities that did not receive a PPP loan during the first round of the program this summer. The Small Business Administration (SBA) and the Department of the Treasury reserved the Monday opening for Community Financial Institutions (CFIs) to submit PPP loan applications.  Wednesday, January 13, 2021, the PPP reopened for eligible small businesses and entities interested in receiving a second PPP loan. The SBA and the Department of the Treasury again reserved this opening period for CFIs to submit applications.  This coming Friday, January 15, 2021, all lenders with $1 billion or less in assets will be allowed to submit applications for First and Second Draw PPP loans.  The PPP will reopen to all lenders, no matter their size, on Tuesday, January 19, 2021.  Over the last week, federal agencies have published and released helpful information as it pertains to PPP. Below is an overview of a few important documents.   - Congress settled the debate surrounding PPP tax deductibility in the latest COVID Relief bill. Expenses made during the covered period can now receive a deduction. This Internal Revenue Service (IRS) guidance nullifies the previous Revenue Ruling on this topic and outlines the change as described in law.   - As outlined in the December COVID Relief bill, the requirement to deduct an Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) Advance from PPP Loan Forgiveness has been repealed. Borrowers who already moved through the PPP Loan Forgiveness process will be made whole. The SBA published this Procedural Notice outlining the repeal and how PPP loans that have already received forgiveness will be handled.   - If a lender participated in the first round of PPP, they do not have to reapply to be a lender during the second round of PPP. This SBA Procedural Notice outlines this determination. If a new lender is interested in participating in PPP for the first time, they can apply using one of the following application forms:      ▪ Form 3506 for Federally Insured Depository Institutions, Federally Insured Credit Unions, Farm Credit System Institutions     ▪ Form 3507 for Non-Bank and Non-Insured Depository Institution Lenders  The SBA and the Department of the Treasury intend to release updated PPP Loan Forgiveness guidance this month.  On Monday, Rep. Bergman provided an update to small businesses that the SBA and Treasury were Re-Opening the PPP.   You can read the full release here.

Dear ,
Yesterday, the House of Representatives impeached Donald Trump for inciting an insurrection that led to the attack at the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021.
I spoke on the House floor to urge my colleagues to do the right thing and impeach President Trump for his dangerous behavior that I believe constitutes “high crimes and misdemeanors” under our Constitution. 
Watch the full video
We must ensure our nation addresses head on the extraordinary threats posed by those who would seek to derail our democracy with unhinged conspiracy theories, extreme rhetoric, and white supremacist ideology—all of which has been made worse by the lies about “election fraud” from President Trump. Congress has a duty to protect the American people from the violence we witnessed last week. I appreciate those who have reached out to my office during this time to share their opinions.
Below are my full remarks entered into the House record:
“The president has engaged in conduct that is criminal, impeachable, and profoundly threatening to our democracy.
“He has sought to overturn an election to keep himself in office and to prevent the peaceful transfer of power. He has done this by perpetrating a big lie, despite counts and recounts and dozens of judicial rulings, and has pressed state officials and members of this body to reject and reverse popular electoral vote outcomes. He then invited and activated a violent mob of right-wing extremists, domestic terrorists, and white nationalists to invade the Capitol and achieve his desired result by insurrection. 
“If that is not impeachable conduct, I don’t know what is. 
“The President must be removed from office immediately and must never be allowed to seek office again, and a marker must be laid down for all time as to what the Constitution and our democracy require.”
In these difficult times, I remain committed to serving, protecting our democratic institutions, and representing our shared values in the U.S. House. I hope you will continue to keep in touch on issues of concern.
Sincerely, 
￼

January 14, 2020 

Dear Friends, 

I wanted to send you an update with resources on the latest coronavirus package that has been signed into law. As you may know, H.R. 133 contained $900 billion for coronavirus relief - critical rescues for Americans across the country and in Connecticut. This bill is a lifeline for those suffering from the effects COVID-19; it provides resources for those who are sick or recovering, a pathway to economic recovery and direct payments for hardworking families. As we continue to wage the battle against the virus, I am committed to fighting for more relief to support families and help our businesses recover.

Below are some useful resources for individuals and families looking to learn more about relief such as unemployment insurance, direct payments, and small business loans:

Economic Impact Payments:

The bill includes additional Economic Impact Payments (EIP): $600 per taxpayer ($1,200 for married filing jointly) earning $75,000 of modified adjusted gross income ($112,500 for heads of household and $150,000 for married filing jointly), in addition to $600 per qualifying child. The credit phases out starting at $75,000 of modified adjusted gross income ($112,500 for heads of household and $150,000 for married filing jointly) at a rate of $5 per $100 of additional income.

Non-filers who are Social Security, SSI, RRB, and VA beneficiaries will be paid automatically by the IRS. Individuals who used the non-filer portal to receive their first EIP under the CARES Act will also be paid automatically.

Married taxpayers filing jointly where one spouse has a Social Security Number and one spouse does not are eligible for a payment of $600, in addition to $600 per child with a Social Security Number. This provision will also apply retroactively to the Economic Impact Payments provided by the CARES Act. 

For information on this provision, please visit the IRS website here.

Additional FAQs answered by the House Ways and Means Committee.

If you did not receive the first Economic Impact Payment you can now claim it on your 2020 taxes as the Recovery Rebate Credit. The IRS stopped taking individual EIP inquiries at the end of November leaving this as the only option.

Unemployment Insurance:

In short, all programs are extended until March 14th, but if enrolled you can stay on until April 5th if you have weeks of eligibility left. Extends Pandemic Unemployment Assistance to March 14, 2021 and allows individuals receiving benefits as of March 14, 2021 to continue through April 5, 2021, as long as the individual has not reached the maximum number of weeks.
	•	Increases the number of weeks of benefits an individual may claim from 39 to 50. 
Extends Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) to March 14, 2021 and allows individuals receiving benefits as of March 14, 2021 to continue through April 5, 2021, as long as the individual has not reached the maximum number of weeks.
	•	Increases the number of weeks of benefits an individual may claim through the PEUC program from 13 to 24. 
Restores the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) supplement to all state and federal unemployment benefits at $300 per week, starting after December 26 and ending March 14, 2021

More information on unemployment benefits will be posted by the State of Connecticut here. 

Paycheck Protection Program:

The bill reopens the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) with $284.5 billion in funding, allowing small businesses to apply for a first or second round PPP loan, capped at $2 million. It sets aside $60 billion for businesses with 10 or fewer employees to ensure we are reaching our hardest hit small businesses in all communities. It also makes critical improvements to the program for nonprofits and restaurants.

Interested businesses should immediately talk to their bank as that is where the loan/grant will be originated. If you need assistance you can utilize a federally funded small business loan specialist at the CT Small Business Development Center or the Women’s Business Development Center. 

Please know I will monitor the roll-out of these provisions closely and keep you updated with any additional developments. Please do not hesitate to reach out to my office for assistance by calling (203) 562-3718. To stay in touch and get the latest updates, please connect with me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. 

Stay safe and be well,

￼ 
Dear friend,  I hope you and your family are staying safe and healthy. Yesterday, I voted to impeach President Trump. After he circulated lies for months about the election being invalid, he continued to stir up anger and encourage his supporters to march to the U.S. Capitol and to use violence to overturn the results of the election on the day that Congress counted the electoral votes. As a result, lives were lost and chaos ensued that was a threat to the beating heart of our country: our democracy. 
I voted for impeachment to safeguard our nation from any future shame or damage that Trump could inflict during his remaining time in office. 
I heard the concerns of many of you who called for accountability after the attempted insurrection and I carried each of your voices with me as I voted in support of impeachment. As we acted to protect our country, I pledge to keep working towards the challenges ahead for Wisconsin’s Fourth by tackling the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting an equitable and strong economic recovery, and working towards healing our divided country by championing the truth and pursuing accountability.
Your friend,  Gwen

Dear Friend,  
One week ago, I stood on the House floor to defend our Constitution, our republic and the will of the American people, by certifying the results of the 2020 election. Moments after I rose to address the chamber and oppose baseless objections to our certification process, the U.S. Capitol was breached, as armed insurrectionists stormed the building and we were evacuated from the House floor. Wednesday’s attack left multiple dead, injured countless police officers and left tremendous damage.
 
This was an attack on our American government, on our democracy and a very present threat to the peaceful transfer of power. It is profoundly clear this attack would not have happened without President Trump’s incitement. In doing so, he has betrayed his oath of office, and he is no longer fit to serve. 
  
 
￼
 
  
Yesterday as the House voted to impeach President Donald Trump for inciting a violent insurrection, I voted yes. 
 
I am humbled that Speaker Pelosi has asked me to serve as an impeachment manager as we anticipate a trial in the U.S. Senate. This is a solemn duty and one I do not take lightly. It is vital that we finish the work began the morning of January 6th to defend our constitution and protect our republic, and that's exactly what I intend to do.
 
Sincerely, 
￼

Hi Lindsey,
As you know, on January 6, 2021, a mob stormed the U.S. Capitol and interrupted the certification of the Electoral College votes. Like you, I realize that January 6th was a dark day for our country.

I know many of you have questions about what happened, and I want to be as open and transparent as possible. Today, January 14, at 5:05 pm MT, I’m hosting a special telephone town hall event to discuss the attack on the Capitol and what Congress is doing to respond. Join us at https://crow.house.gov/live or call (855) 286-0296.

1/14/21 12:52,Expelling Trumpism requires reforming our elections,"￼ 
Dear Lindsey,
Just last week, at the behest of the outgoing president of the United States, domestic terrorists attacked the legislative branch of the government of the United States. Five people died from the melee on the Capitol grounds. It's a miracle that during the insurrection the Capitol didn't burn and many more people weren't killed. Some of my fellow senators said they felt that returning to the chamber and finishing the Electoral College count was a signal that America was already turning the page. 

Not in my book. 

In the wake of this attack, Congress must pass reforms to defend our democracy from the forces that supported, incited and fueled the riots - which means making it easier for every American to vote. We cannot - must not - move forward in the belief that the end of Donald Trump's presidency means all is well in our country. 

After all, what happened after police cleared the Capitol building and workers began cleaning up the wreckage and blood? Republicans walked right back into the House and Senate chambers and continued spreading the same lies about voters and voting rights that had drawn the mob to the Capitol in the first place. 

Ted Cruz claimed that he just wanted an election commission to study the results in Arizona and Pennsylvania - where Biden won decisive victories. Josh Hawley claimed that he was just giving voice to his constituents' concerns about election integrity by attempting to throw out the legally cast ballots of millions of Pennsylvanians. It was nothing more than self-promotion and a barefaced, ham-handed attempt to delegitimize the next administration. 

Only a handful of Senate Republicans voted with Cruz and Hawley - but more than half of House Republicans voted against acknowledging the legal results of the presidential election. Who knows what would have happened if their numbers were a little higher or if Republicans controlled a majority in the House? Where would the transfer of power stand now if their attempt to block the recognition of the Electoral College count succeeded for more than a few hours? Would the courts have had to intervene? Would the military? 

Weighing these questions, I'm alarmed - for Oregonians, for the children who will one day inherit our battered democracy. 

Disenfranchisement, particularly of Black voters, has already become routine again since the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013. And now, having seen voters help both elect Biden and send two Democrats to the Senate, Georgia Republicans are gearing up to pass a whole new raft of laws to disenfranchise voters. They're aiming to put unjustifiable new limits on absentee voting, and, if some Georgia Republicans have their way, the only polling place in metro Atlanta might well be hidden somewhere in the rafters of Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Other red states will surely follow Georgia's lead. 

The good news is Democrats will soon hold the majority in the Senate - albeit an awfully slim one, and only guaranteed for two years. However, having only a slim majority will not diminish our commitment to protecting American democracy and voting rights. This must be a country where everybody can vote and every vote counts. 

First, we need the kind of election system that experts agree is the most secure: one that uses hand-marked paper ballots and risk-limiting audits.That's the tried-and-true system in Oregon, where we vote at home and send our ballots in by mail. 

Oregon is proof that vote-by-mail elections are secure - and our state's voter participation rate is routinely among the highest in the country. I was the first senator elected in an all-mail election 25 years ago. Voting by mail works just as well in red states, too - just ask Sens. Mitt Romney and Mike Lee of Utah, both Republicans. 

Second, there is no longer any excuse for blocking statehood and full representation in Congress for the District of Columbia. Trump has proven in front of the whole nation that a president like him will not protect the nation's capital from violence, even if he is the only national representative they have the right to elect. Republican objections to statehood have nothing to do with the virtue of having a ""federal city."" It's pure, ugly politics: They simply don't like that Washington's residents vote predominantly Democratic. It's a deeply shameful thing that the more than 700,000 Americans living in Washington, D.C., are forced into a lower class of citizenship. 

The same goes for the American citizens in Puerto Rico. If statehood is what they want, they should be able to make that choice. The way Trump and Republicans have treated Puerto Rico - particularly when its residents have suffered so much - is revolting. 

Unless there's a grassroots mobilization, it will be a challenge to get significant Republican support for these proposals. But the alternative is to proceed further with a dangerous status quo - one that got us a tyrant in the White House, a violent attack on the Capitol and an attempt to overturn the will of millions of voters by violence and executive fiat. Our democracy is fragile. Democrats have an obligation to strengthen it.

Matt's Weekly Memo
 
  
Dear Lindsey,
 
Here's what I've been up to this week in Washington and in Northeastern Pennsylvania.
  
 
Ensuring Accountability for Last Week's Attack on the Capitol
 
It has been a sad week in Washington as we continue to learn more about the attack on our Capitol and what led to it.
 
It is clear that the President incited this attack that attempted to stop the peaceful transfer of power. Weeks of unfounded claims of wrongdoing and illegality in this election, encouraging his supporters to converge on the nation's capital on January 6, and an incendiary rally on that day gave way to the attack on the Capitol.
 
This threat to a core Constitutional process could not go unanswered.
 
Marion and I are praying for the family of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick and the others who lost their lives or were injured in that day’s violence. We also pray for peace in our nation over the coming week and for relief from the rampaging virus that has been taking shocking numbers of lives every day.
  
 
Fighting for Education Funding for NEPA
 
This week, I had the pleasure of joining Scranton-Lackawanna County Head Start's administrator and a former Head Start parent as I announced that the organization received its final disbursement of a 5-year grant totaling $3,854,123, which they’ll use to continue providing young students with a strong foundation for success later in life.
  
￼
  
We were not only looking back on all of the good Scranton-Lackawanna Head Start has been able to do over the years with these resources – we’re looking forward to ensuring their vital efforts can continue for years to come. My team and I are proud to be helping them secure a renewal of this grant funding, because education is supposed to give everyone a shot at a better life, and no child should be denied that opportunity. Watch our discussion on Facebook Live here.
  
 
PPP Loan Application Open
 
PPP loan applications are back open for small businesses that have been hit hard by the pandemic. Congress has expanded eligibility and made the program more flexible to better meet businesses' unique needs. Visit my website to learn more and apply: 
  
PPP Loan Information
  
Eligibility: Businesses that (1) have no more than 300 employees, (2) demonstrate a loss of 25 percent of gross receipts in any quarter during 2020 when compared to the same quarter in 2019, and (3) have used the full amount of their first PPP before a second loan is disbursed are eligible for additional loans.
  
 
PA Open Enrollment Deadline
 
Need health insurance? Pennsylvania's health care open enrollment closes tomorrow, Friday, January 15.
 
To apply, visit the Commonwealth's new insurance marketplace, Pennie. Shop for plans, find financial assistance options and get the coverage you and your family need. Click here to get started now!
  
 
PA's COVID-19 Vaccination Plan
 
The Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines have been rigorously tested and proven to be safe and effective. The Pennsylvania Department of Health has outlined a process for administering these vaccines. In this first phase, known as 1A, frontline health care workers and long-term care facility residents are eligible.
  
￼
  
The Department of Health has said they expect to start Phase 1B soon but has not given an exact timeline. My team and I are tracking the reports and will be keeping you up to date on this process. For more information on Pennsylvania’s vaccine distribution, click here.
  
 
Stay Connected
 
As always, we want to keep in touch. Follow us on Twitter and Facebook, and if you haven't already, share your 2021 priorities with us.
  
Share your priorities

1/14/21 12:10,SPECIAL EDITION Lankford Letter - Rumor or True?,"￼
Home
Constituent Services
About Me
Newsroom
 Dear Oklahoma friends and neighbors: 
After the unthinkable and horrific attack on the United States Capitol happened on January 6, rumors are flying on social media right now making many people  even more worried and fearful. The Capitol has always been a symbol of our freedom and the place where hard issues are discussed and every opinion is heard, not where a violent mob races through the building attacking, destroying, and trying to intimidate. 
There is a lot of information that has circulated in the past week. However, I’ve been asked questions about rumors that are just simply not true. I would encourage all of us not to just accept every rumor as fact and to show personal restraint before sharing with others things we do not know whether they are actually true. This is a moment when we need to pour water over the fire, not gasoline. 
Here are a few of the rumors I’ve seen and heard so far along with what I believe is at least one credible source to debunk or confirm the rumor: 
Rumor: “There was a running police officer leading the mob in the Capitol” – Many have seen video of a Capitol police officer running up a staircase alone in front of a group of people illegally entering the Capitol. People have accused him of letting the mob in or even “enticing them.” That could not be further from the truth. I know that officer well, and we speak often. His name is Eugene, and he is a hero. He distracted the mob away from the Senate Chamber while staff and Senators were still in the chamber. His “leading” actually turned the mob away from the Senate floor and toward other officers, buying time to evacuate the building, and probably saved lives. 
For a story in The Hill newspaper about Eugene’s heroism,  please visit: https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/533657-capitol-police-officer-hailed-as-hero-for-drawing-rioters-away-from-senate 
For another story from the Washington Post about Eugene,  please visit: https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/goodman-capitol-police-video/2021/01/13/08ab3eb6-546b-11eb-a931-5b162d0d033d_story.html 
Rumor: “There were buses of ANTIFA members that came to the Capitol for the protest” – The rumor has spread across social media that the Capitol Police escorted in buses of ANTIFA protestors during the gathering at the Capitol. Video “evidence” is linked which shows multiple buses pulling up led by the Capitol police. While it is true the Capitol Police brought in buses during the riot, they were actually empty buses to evacuate staff and Members of Congress trapped in the buildings. The Capitol police had multiple options for securing the people in the Capitol, one of which was getting them out of the building entirely. 
Rumor: “The federal government is about to declare martial law” – Fears of a declaration of martial law are some of the most quickly spread on social media. I understand Oklahomans’ concerns with the idea that a president could utilize our nation’s military service members and/or National Guard to suddenly act as national law enforcement. In recent days, the primary concern I’ve seen raised concerning martial law is that President Trump—or soon President Biden—could utilize provisions of the Insurrection Act inappropriately to control Americans involved in or even suspected to be involved in an insurrection attempt like the one being discussed at the US Capitol last week. The Insurrection Act reads: 
Whenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages, or rebellion against the authority of the United States, make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States in any State by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, he may call into Federal service such of the militia of any State, and use such of the armed forces, as he considers necessary to enforce those laws or to suppress the rebellion. 
But in order to enact the Insurrection Act, a president is required by law to make a public declaration. This cannot happen secretly. For a detailed report from the Congressional Research Service entitled, “The Posse Comitatus Act and Related Matters: The Use of the Military to Execute Civilian Law,"" please visit: https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R42659 
To read one outlet’s reporting about the Insurrection Act and the rumors swirling about martial law, please visit: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/01/11/insurrection-act-trump-capitol-riot/6619972002/ 
The Oklahoma National Guard also recently shared one of these rumors on Twitter and assured us that it is completely false. To see the tweet, visit: https://twitter.com/OKGuard/status/1349085489903529984 
Rumor: “There are two aircraft carriers off the East and West Coast preparing for military action” – Over the last several months, my staff and I have heard rumors of the presence of various numbers of military fighter jets, cargo planes, aircraft carriers or other increased military seeming to “await orders” in some area of the country or just off the coast. We’ve spoken to military personnel we trust, and they have not indicated that such military movements of aircraft are concerning or irregular. These are people we work with daily who serve our nation with integrity and whose information we trust.
Part of our normal defense operations include around two million flight hours and numerous training missions. To ensure readiness, our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines are always training. If you drive down I-40 in Oklahoma City, you’ll likely cross paths with an E-6 or a KC-135 taking off or landing. If you’re in Enid, it’s rare not to see a T-38 or a T-6 buzzing around the skies. This is part of our normal training, and there’s been no change in our readiness posture that would give credence to this rumor. My staff followed up on this rumor this week with our military liaisons just to be sure your fears were heard, and they assured us there is no imminent change in readiness planned at this time.
Rumor: “Seeing unusual increased military activity across the country” – There is a normal, increased posture of readiness in certain areas of the military around a presidential inauguration since we never want our adversaries to perceive weakness from our nation during a transition of power. To read more about the uptick in National Guard presence in Washington, DC, leading up to the 2009 inauguration of President Obama, please visit: https://www.nationalguard.mil/News/Article/573700/national-guard-details-support-to-inauguration/ 
Rumor: “The National Guard is being secretly called up all over the country” – You can’t secretly call up the National Guard. “Calling them up” involves thousands of decisions that directly affect our friends and neighbors. 
To read the actual law that governs how and when the National Guard can be called via a state’s Governor, please visit: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/10/12406 
At this time the National Guard is being asked to help preserve national security during the transition of power, and the area in and around Washington, DC, will have additional National Guardsmen and women on hand to ensure the safety and continuity of our government. To see some of the stunning pictures from the Today Show of hundreds of National Guardsmen and women protecting the US Capitol, please visit: https://www.today.com/news/national-guard-troops-seen-sleeping-capitol-striking-photos-t205738 
To read more about the plans for National Guard deployment surrounding inauguration day, please visit: https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-army/2021/01/11/national-guard-inauguration-deployment-twice-as-large-as-troop-levels-in-afghanistan-and-iraq-combined/ 
Rumor: “The President is going to take over the Emergency Alert System since he was banned from Twitter” – Over the past weekend, we heard that President Trump was going to use the national Emergency Alert System to communicate with Americans. Despite being banned from or having material removed from social media sites, President Trump can still address the nation at press conferences, etc. as well as other websites and platforms. The Integrated Public Alert and Warning System Modernization Act of 2015 (read it HERE) clearly states that this system can only be used to transmit a message that is related to a national emergency. Presidential alerts are only sent on a limited basis if there is an actual threat to public safety. 
Rumor: “There are armed attacks planned for every state capital on January 20th” – This is not a baseless rumor, and law enforcement is encouraging local, state, and federal agencies to exercise caution, particularly on and around January 20th to ensure personnel can be prepared and vigilant. Although no specific threats are being reported, after last week, we certainly cannot say “nothing’s going to happen.” I encourage all of us to be vigilant. My staff and I are in contact with local and federal law enforcement who continue to urge caution and vigilance around these national events.
If you hear that a person is considering carrying out acts of violence against the United States or any person, it is your moral and legal obligation to report that information to local law enforcement or the FBI before the plan is carried out. Let’s all watch out for each other during this volatile time, and let’s find ways to talk peacefully and civilly about our differences and resolve them before they spill over into violence. It is who we are as Americans.
I will be at the inauguration of Joe Biden on January 20th to represent all Oklahomans, just like I was for Presidents Obama (2013) and Trump (2017). Even when we disagree, we respect the peaceful transition of power in America.

ICYMI: Pfluger introduces bill to ‘stand up for oil and gas’
By Mella McEwan, Originally Published in the Midland Reporter Telegram on January 13, 2021 

August Pfluger had barely been sworn into Congress, representing District 11, which includes Midland and Odessa, when he filed his first legislation.

The Republican has filed the Saving America’s Energy Future Act, legislation designed to prevent the incoming Biden Administration from implementing a moratorium on issuing new oil and gas drilling permits on federal lands.

The legislation is “the first step – I didn’t want to wait, I wanted to send the message that the industry is important for its jobs, to the economy, to the nation,” Pfluger told the Reporter-Telegram in a telephone interview.

He went on to add, “By putting this forward, I want to see where people stand. There are Democrats who represent districts with energy operations. Are they pro energy or do they want to kill the industry?” 

“We are committed to doing what I said I would do during the campaign, and that’s stand up for oil and gas. Ever since I first put on the Air Force uniform in 1996, we’ve been talking energy security. That the Permian Basin is responsible for 70 percent of the total US oil and gas production growth is amazing. The US is the No. 1 producer in the world, we’re not reliant on foreign energy

Approximately 25 percent of the nation’s oil and gas production is from federal lands, Pfluger pointed out, and a moratorium on new drilling would directly impact Midland and Odessa. A number of producers headquartered in the two cities are also active in southeast New Mexico, he noted.

“I want to send the message that it’s not OK with a decision to ban new drilling permits and the impact it would have on jobs, the economy and national security. When you look at the revenues New Mexico gets from state lands, that fund schools, it makes no sense.”

Pfluger estimated that if hydraulic fracturing alone were banned on federal lands, it could cost up to 7.5 million jobs. “Not only that, it would return us to a heavy dependence on foreign oil, up to 40 percent by 2030.”

Beyond oil and gas, he said the resulting decline due to a ban on oil and gas activity on federal lands would impact industries – like agriculture, a major industry in his district – across the state and the country.

“That’s how critical this is. That’s why I didn’t want to wait. I want Democrats to know how critical the industry is.”


Sincerely,
￼

1/14/21 11:34,President Trump Incited an Insurrection,"￼

Dear Friends,  First and foremost, I want to thank each and every one of you who have reached out in recent days to offer your support and check on the well-being of my staff and I. While I am fortunate enough to have come through last Wednesday's events unscathed, I remain shocked and appalled by what took place.
 
That's why I voted to impeach Donald Trump for a second time. 
 
Make no mistake: President Trump and his enablers are personally responsible for inciting the violence at the Capitol on January 6. The aim of this insurrection was to overturn the results of a free and fair election that he lost, and came after weeks of the President’s repeated lies about the 2020 election. After the violence began, President Trump refused to act to bring it to an end, and in the days since, he has shown no remorse.
 
If Congress is to uphold our oaths of office to protect and defend the Constitution, President Trump must be convicted by the Senate and removed from office immediately.
 
Yesterday, I spoke on the floor of the House of Representatives about the President's unprecedented attack on the legislative branch. You can watch my speech below:
  
 
￼
 
  
Let me reassure you, this act of domestic terrorism may have temporarily delayed President elect-Biden’s certification on Wednesday but Congress remained undeterred. We returned to the House Floor that same day, certified the results, and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be sworn in as the next President and Vice-President on January 20, 2021.
 
As always, I hope you will take the time to share your opinion with me. You can contact me on social media platforms under @RepMikeQuigley, by email using my website at https://quigley.house.gov/contact, or by phone at (202) 225-4061.
 
  
Sincerely,
￼
  
Mike Quigley

1/14/21 9:35,Tracking your 2nd direct payment,"Enews Sign Up  |  Visit My Website 
￼
ABOUT  |   CONTACT  |   ISSUES  |   MEDIA  |   SERVICES 

Dear Friend,
  
I know this continues to be a very difficult time for our community and country. In December, a $908 billion COVID-19 Relief Package was signed into law and includes $600 direct payments for every eligible adult earning up to $75,000 and any dependent children.
 
Let me be clear: I know this is not enough. Please know I will continue to advocate for more relief in order to get our public health and our economy back on track.
 
Some of you may have already gotten your direct payment, but I know many others are still waiting. Below are some tools to help you track your payment and understand what to expect. Please share this information with your friends and family to make sure everyone who qualifies for a stimulus check receives one.
  
 
WHERE IS MY PAYMENT?
 
The payment information from your 2018 or 2019 tax returns is used to distribute this stimulus payment to you. If you received your tax refund electronically, you will receive this payment electronically to your most recent bank account on file.
 
If the IRS does not have direct deposit information on file for you for tax years 2018 or 2019, this payment will come to you by mail to the last address you provided the IRS. The IRS has already begun issuing the direct payments in the form of debit cards, that will arrive in a white envelope with the U.S. Treasury seal on it.
 
Click here or the button below to check the status of your payment.
  
Get My Payment
  
  
  
 
HOW MUCH DO I GET?
 
Eligible adults earning up to $75,000 and children will receive a $600 stimulus check. Most families of four will recieve $2,400. See how much you'll recieve using the calculator below.
  
Stimulus Check Calculator
  
  
All individuals must have a Social Security Number (SSN) to qualify, with the exception of military families where only one spouse has a SSN. Employment status does not impact this payment—whether or not you have a job, you will be receiving this. This stimulus payment is not taxable and does not count as income for eligibility purposes for federal programs.
 
Additionally, this new COVID-19 bill will allow mixed-status families to recieve direct payments and makes mixed-status families retroactively eligible for direct payments under the CARES Act.
  
 
WHAT IF I DON'T FILE TAXES?
 
Social Security, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and Railroad Retirement, and Veterans Affairs beneficiaries:
 
You don't need to take any action! You will receive it by direct deposit or paper check, depending on how you normally receive your benefits.
 
All other non-filers who did not register with the IRS Non-Filer tool before November 21, 2020 may be eligible to claim the credit by filing a 2020 1040 or 1040-SR for free using the IRS Free File program.
  
 
I DIDN'T RECEIVE MY PAYMENT BY JAN 15TH
 
Eligible individuals who did not receive their second direct payment by January 15, 2021, may claim the Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2020 Form 1040 or 1040-SR. More information on this credit and eligibility requirements can be found here.
 You must file Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit even if you are normally not required to file a tax return. Anyone with income of $72,000 or less can file their Federal tax return electronically for free through the IRS Free File Program. 
  
 
I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS
 
The IRS has created a list of frequently asked questions and other tools to help you determine your eligibility, navigate address changes, understand if you need to take action and more. Find that resource here.
 
You can also contact my office and my staff will help you find more information.
 
I know we are in a challenging time and I believe we will get through it together. I am working every day to make sure our Central Coast is represented in Washington, and I am continuing to fight for resources for our community as we combat the coronavirus.
 
Please continue heeding the advice of health officials, stay home as much as possible and stay safe.
  
Sincerely,
￼
  
Congressman Salud Carbajal

1/13/21 21:12,Holding President Trump Accountable,"￼  
Dear Friend,   Today the House of Representatives impeached Donald Trump on a bipartisan vote.   Donald Trump has levied unceasing attacks on our laws and Constitution since he lost the November election.  He tried to overturn a lawful election, and incited a domestic terror attack by a mob wielding weapons, Confederate flags and Nazi symbols on our nation’s Capitol.  The violent attack threatened the lives of the vice president, members of Congress and their staffs, and members of law enforcement, and left two police officers dead and scores injured. Donald Trump launched an insurrection and is completely unfit to be president.    Every day that he remains in the Oval Office and is not held accountable for attacking our country’s Constitution is a serious threat to the safety of the American people and the institutions of our democratic republic. I applaud the U.S. House of Representatives for taking swift and decisive action today to hold this president accountable for his dangerous and unrepentant behavior.   It is now the responsibility of the U.S. Senate to convene and to immediately hold an impeachment trial.    We face arguably the most serious threat to the integrity of our national government since the Civil War. This is no time for partisan calculations and personal ambition to drive decisions. Everyone who believes in our Constitution and the rule of law should come together to defend our democracy.     In order to seek justice and heal from last week’s disturbing violence, we must demand accountability from all involved, including the president. I swore an oath to defend the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic, and I will deliver on that promise with everything I have. Our precious democracy is under attack and we all must come together if to preserve government of the people, by the people, and for the people.    All my best,  Jeff

Politicizing Impeachment

Last week’s violent attack on the U.S. Capitol was abhorrent, and I condemn every unlawful action that occurred. Every single person who participated deserves to be prosecuted. The intimidating acts against Capitol Police, other law enforcement, and congressional Members and staff, including bomb threats, have no place in a free and functioning Republic. I grieve for our nation and the Capitol Police and others who lost their lives and are still recovering as a result of the riot.
 
Information regarding last week’s attack is still forthcoming. Investigations are only beginning and there is much we do not yet know. Capitol Police leadership and other law enforcement agencies owe Congress and the American people answers. However, we do know the FBI office in Virginia has made clear that they had communicated potential premeditated threats to D.C. and the Capitol ahead of the January 6th rally. 
 
It is fair to say that the expectations for what could be accomplished in terms of certifying the election on January 6th were inflated beyond what was reasonable — especially concerning the constitutional authorities of the Vice President in counting the electoral college vote. But the President was clear that day in saying ""I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.""
 
One year ago, over my objection, Congress took what was considered a once-in-a-generation vote to impeach a president. That vote followed a hyper-politicized effort that had begun before he was even elected. Sadly, under current Democratic leadership, impeachment has become a politicized tool — part of the cancel culture movement of the left to silence dissent. With only one week until Inauguration Day, it is not in the best interest of the nation to move forward in this way. And with only one week since the tragic events of January 6th, it is not being done with the rigorous examination, debate, and due process such an extraordinary measure mandates. 
 
During this time I have thought a lot about Ronald Reagan’s remarks that ""freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.""
 
As a nation, we are in need of healing and restoration. We need a return to honest dialogue and debate over political issues. Trading 280 character barbs will not lead to better policy for the American people nor the understanding that leads to healthy communities and families. I am firmly committed to standing strong for the conservative constitutional principles that have guided this great American experiment in self-governance — and opposing the doctrines that would seek to undermine free people. How we go about those debates is important and says a lot about who we are as a people. And while we work toward that more perfect union, it will do us well to remember Benjamin Franklin’s admonishment from Scripture to us that ""unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain."" May God bless you and have mercy on our nation.

Calling Out the Hypocrisy of Big Tech
￼
￼
￼
￼
Our country is in a dangerous place when the social media companies that colluded to suppress news about the election are now limiting free speech. The deceptive algorithms and censoring is unacceptable. I question the motives of companies that permit the Chinese Communist Party to freely post but limit Americans. I believe it is hypocritical and inconsistent, which is why Congress needs to focus on this bipartisan issue in the 117th Congress. I spoke with Crossroads about this topic. You can watch the full interview HERE. As a result of Big Tech's censorship, I recently joined Gab and Parler. Follow me @RepCloudTX.

Reintroducing the Improving Confidence in Veterans' Care Act
￼
￼
￼
￼
You may remember that I first introduced a bill to improve the quality of healthcare that veterans receive from the Veterans Healthcare Administration in June 2019. I just reintroduced it into the 117th Congress and will press for it to be signed into law. The Improving Confidence in Veterans’ Care Act will help foster veterans’ confidence specifically in VA physicians.  

A report found that some Veterans Health Administration facilities had hired unqualified doctors who had lost their medical licenses, some for reasons like patient neglect or other serious offenses. The main reason unlicensed doctors were permitted to practice was because VHA employees were not properly trained on the resources available to check the status of these licenses. I reintroduced my bill to correct this oversight and help improve veterans’ confidence in VA physicians. Unqualified doctors should not be providing care for our veterans, and my bill would make sure that any doctor whose license has been taken away or suspended would not be allowed to practice medicine for the VA.

Our nation owes it to our veterans to deliver on the promises we made to them - because exceptional Americans like our veterans deserve exceptional healthcare.

1/13/21 20:26,Impeachment is a political exercise that will further divide our nation,"January 13, 2020
View Email in Browser 
￼ 

Dear Friend,
There are but seven days before our nation witnesses the swearing-in of our 46th president, Joe Biden.
After the horrific, catastrophic attack on the U.S. Capitol last week by a mob committed to disrupting the work of democracy, our nation is crying out for leadership – leadership that works towards healing our wounds both physical and spiritual.  Yet, a week after the Capitol crisis, instead of leadership, we have more divisive and inherently political brinkmanship.
This includes President Trump claiming no responsibility for the toxic rhetorical environment that is directly related to the attacks of January 6, and Speaker Pelosi’s demanding a snap impeachment without reflection or even the full facts that led to the attack – as well as President-elect Joe Biden’s notable absence of action following his words calling for unity.
I ask: Have we not had enough recrimination and divisive rhetoric? Fingers pointing and responsibility not being taken? 
For months, our beloved nation, filled with hundreds of millions of inherently good people, has suffered death and economic destruction in the midst of a global pandemic. But, instead of an effort of unity to focus on those and other critical needs, since the 2016 election, dangerous rhetoric has reverberated – from the pitched poison of the left urging attacks on police and cabinet members and from the right, claiming a stolen 2020 election. 
￼

After the final certification of the Electoral College on December 14th, when no reasonable path to victory was evident, President Trump should have welcomed President-Elect Joe Biden to the White House. Likewise, in an attempt to heal and unite, President-Elect Biden should have called the Speaker and said: ""enough"" to her plans for impeachment. And for her part, the Speaker should have followed her better instincts and stopped her caucus short of these twin bad constitutional precedents set, including this snap impeachment, which is where we find ourselves now.

So, this week, we've taken a vote to impeach the president, an action that will further divide and victimize the American people, desperate to pause this political brinkmanship. Instead, we should be working to find a commonality among us to aid our collective soul of democracy, wounded in the recent attack.

Alexander Hamilton in Federalist 65 told his 1788 audience: ""The prosecution [of impeachments] ... will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide it into parties more or less friendly or inimical to the accused.""

Indeed.

Just last week I talked about the fundamental importance of the United States Constitution and its requirement that the House and Senate meet and count the properly certified electoral college votes from our states. Today, Congress is yet again presented with a constitutional question: This time, whether the president's rhetoric in the post-election period is the cause of the illegal and immoral attack on the U.S. Capitol, the seat of American democracy.

We are not presented with an impeachment article on treason or bribery, so we're left with “other high crimes and misdemeanors.""

There's no question that the president’s hot rhetoric, prone to exaggeration and self-aggrandizement, has been unattractive and in many ways divisive. The president in his post-election fiction and folly suggesting a landslide victory and a stolen election, in my view, sullies his four years of economic and national security accomplishments. He casts a shadow over his major initiatives in defeating ISIS, opening a new chapter in Middle Eastern peace with the Abraham Accords, and enhancing economic liberty and religious freedom at home and abroad. And this president’s rhetoric in the days leading up to Wednesday’s attack was unforgivable.

But what needs acknowledgment is that there are implications of Congress’ actions in relation to the fundamental protections afforded by the First Amendment. The Speaker has set the precedent of offering no alternative, short of impeachment. I repeat, no alternative, short of impeachment, in response to their past statements. This should be noted by all leaders across the political spectrum. And, this vote is a political exercise that will further inflame tensions rather than easing them, burdening the peaceful transfer of power rather than celebrating it.

Today, our nation cries for leadership from the current and future White House occupant, as well as from the leaders across the very Capitol that itself was attacked on Wednesday. Each of these critical leaders in our nation's history at this moment would benefit from reflecting on John Jay’s admonition in Federalist 64 where he cautions: ""The government must be a weak one indeed, if it should forget that the good of the whole can only be promoted by advancing the good of each of the parts or members which compose the whole.""

And so let's go forth seeking unity in purpose by honoring our Constitution, preserving this Republic, and calling on all Americans to advance the good of our nation and thus benefit the whole of our country.

Sincerely,
￼ 
Representative French Hill

Murphy Votes to Impeach the President for Incitement of Insurrection 
￼
Click image above to watch Murphy's video remarks.
WASHINGTON—Today, U.S. Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy of Winter Park, Fla., voted to impeach President Donald Trump for his role in inciting an insurrection and a violent occupation of the U.S. Capitol on Jan., 6, 2021. In a video statement, Murphy denounced the violence perpetrated by the mob last week and called on Americans to unite behind the need to hold the President accountable for his actions.  “Today’s impeachment is not about dividing this country. It’s about uniting all patriotic Americans against the unconstitutional actions of an out-of-control president—a president who incited insurrection against our great nation,” said Murphy. “I’m proud both Democrats and Republicans voted to hold the President accountable for his actions. We voted to fulfill our constitutional, moral, and patriotic obligation to safeguard our democracy.”  To view her video statement, click here. A full transcript of her remarks can be found below.  Hello everyone.  I’m speaking to you today with a heavy heart. But also with a sense of resolve. That’s because I voted to impeach the President of the United States.  Many of you know my story. When I was a child, my family fled a communist dictatorship in Vietnam. We were rescued by the U.S. Navy and given refuge in America. This country saved our lives and gave us a new beginning.  That’s why last week’s attack broke my heart. A violent mob assaulted the U.S. Capitol. They defiled our democracy. They murdered a police officer. And they tried to destroy everything that is good and right and honorable about America.  The mob was incited by the President. Based on an absolute lie—the complete fiction that the 2020 election was not free and fair. This, to me, is an impeachable offense.  Let me be clear. Today’s impeachment is not about dividing this country.  It’s about uniting all patriotic Americans against the unconstitutional actions of an out-of-control president—a  president who incited insurrection against our great nation.  You know, I’m proud both Democrats and Republicans voted to hold the President accountable for his actions. We voted to fulfill our constitutional, moral, and patriotic obligation to safeguard our democracy.  This is a dark chapter in America—and healing will take time.  I, for one, will never let terrorists extinguish America’s light as the shining city on a hill; the beacon of hope, liberty, and peace for the world.  I’m hopeful that tomorrow will be a brighter day, and I’ll never stop fighting for the country I love.

Dear Lindsey,  I just voted to impeach President Donald Trump for inciting violence against the United States. Last Wednesday, domestic terrorists – inspired by the president – led an insurrection on the U.S. Capitol to overturn the presidential election and overthrow the government.
 
Several House Republicans joined my colleagues and me in impeaching this president. The bipartisan nature of this historic vote highlights the urgency in removing Donald Trump from office.
 
I take my oath to the Constitution and my service to my constituents in Los Angeles seriously. To stay silent after the tragic events of last week would have been a dereliction of my Congressional duty. Our democracy is resilient, but we still must fight for it every day.

We Have a Duty to Do What’s Best for Our Nation


Today, Congressman Ron Wright voted NO on impeaching President Trump and issued the following statement: 

“I am still in shock and disgusted with the violence and hatred we witnessed last week at our nation’s Capitol. These actions are not representative of what it means to be an American, plain and simple. Every single one of the violent rioters should be held accountable and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. 

As our beloved country prepares for a peaceful transition of power into a Biden Administration, it’s time that we all come together, not as Democrats and Republicans, but as Americans. Abandoning norms and traditions to impeach President Trump with less than ten days left in his term will only cause more hatred and division across our communities. 

As Members of Congress, we have a duty to do what’s best for our nation. Let’s tone down the rhetoric and focus on the issues we came to Washington to solve for our constituents. We have a lot to be optimistic about, and it’s time we work together on common-sense solutions to get the United States of America back on track.”

Accountability and Justice

Dear Neighbor,

I pray that you and your loved ones are healthy and staying safe.

Today I voted to impeach the president for his role in inciting last week's violent insurrection in Washington, D.C.

I love our country. Our democracy is the foundation that sustains everything from our personal safety to our opportunities for a better life. Without our democracy, we are not safe or free. Protecting our democracy—and the opportunities and security that it provides—is a sacred obligation.

Last week, attackers incited by President Trump wounded dozens of Capitol Police officers and killed one while trying to overturn our democracy. My thoughts and prayers go out to Officer Sicknick's family. The attackers also sought to ""capture"" the Vice President and other elected representatives.

The attackers, inspired by lies about the election, were attempting to stop the peaceful transition of power which our country has honored and carried out for nearly 250 years. They failed.

But we cannot simply move on because they failed. The president and others incited this mob to a violent attempt to overturn our democracy. Their statements about the election were false, dangerous and reckless. Dozens of lawsuits by the president to overturn the election have failed for lack of evidence. The Department of Homeland Security has said that this was the most secure election in American history. Many people warned that the president's lies would lead to violence, yet those warnings were ignored.

In times of danger, Americans have always come together to do what was right. We must heal and unify our nation. Healing requires justice. Unity requires accountability.

I pray that our country will come together in this tough time to stand once again for democracy and truth, to heal and restore our nation, and to pursue the important work of ensuring a safe and prosperous future for every American.

It is an honor and a privilege to serve and represent you. Please continue to care for one another and stay safe. I know that we can get through this together.

Sincerely,
￼
U.S. Rep. Val Demings

￼ ￼ ￼￼ ￼￼ ￼￼￼ 

Dear Friends, 
 
As I continue to process the unprecedented events of January 6 – when a violent insurrection incited by the president of the United States and his enablers took place at our nation’s Capitol – I have grown increasingly angry and concerned. 
 
I was one of dozens of lawmakers who were trapped inside the House chamber when the violent mob broke into the citadel of our democracy and began ransacking the building.
 
We can’t allow mob rule to win the day. That’s why I supported the immediate removal of President Trump from office by way of the 25th amendment. Because the Vice President Pence and the cabinet didn’t act, I supported impeachment for the second time. 
 
Last week, one branch of government physically attacked another. It was a blatant attempt to circumvent the peaceful democratic rule of our country. We cannot turn away and go back to business as usual. The more we learn about the events leading up to and during the insurrection, the more troubling the details become. 
 
In addition to calling for the removal of this dangerous President, I’m also calling for the resignation of Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks, who offered an incendiary speech at the so-called “Stop the Steal Rally” prior to the insurrection. 
 
These actions and their devastating consequences are an indelible stain on our nation’s history, and demonstrate, unequivocally, that Trump and Brooks are not fit for offices they are sworn to serve.
 
I will continue to pursue truth, transparency and accountability in my role as your legislator in Washington, and I promise to uphold the Constitution and the sacred trust you’ve placed in me.
 
As always, I appreciate your time and feedback. Please remember you can reach me and get updates on what’s happening in Washington and GA-04 on my Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages by clicking the icons at the top of this e-letter. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to represent you in Congress. As we roll out the COVID-19 vaccines, please continue following CDC guidelines.

￼
￼
￼

Dear Hoosiers,

I made a promise to my fellow Hoosiers that my highest priority in Congress would be working to return our government to one that is by the people and for the people. We need to ensure that officials in Washington are focused on defending the Constitution and bettering the lives of their constituents, not their own careers. To this end, I have been one of the biggest proponents of term limits in Congress, which is why I have again introduced a Constitutional Amendment to limit the number of terms Representatives and Senators can serve in Congress.

Currently, there are many Members who have been serving in Congress for multiple decades and our nation is one week away from inaugurating a president who served 36 years in the United States Senate. Our great nation’s Founders had a vision for a government made up of dutiful public servants that would use their personal life experiences to better our way of life with the goal of eventually returning to live under the same laws they advocated for in Congress.

As all Hoosiers know, actions speak louder than words. That is why I have pledged to only serve no more than 4 terms (8 total years) in the House of Representatives—the same amount my proposed Constitutional Amendment outlines— and I am currently serving in my third term.


QUESTION OF THE WEEK: Do you support setting term limits for Members of Congress to ensure they focus on their constituents and not on their job security?

[_] Yes, I support setting term limits for Members of Congress 
[_] No, I do not support setting term limits for Members of Congress 
[_] I don’t know 
[_] Other

Bergman Releases Statement Against Impeachment

Washington - Rep. Jack Bergman issued the following statement:
""The electoral process in Congress has appropriately taken place as provided by our Constitution and laws. With one week remaining before Vice President Joe Biden takes office, today’s move to impeach the President will certainly only further divide our Nation and undoubtedly delay or derail legislation that would help our constituents.  ""Let me be clear - as a Nation, we must address the issues that led to last week’s riot at the Capitol, and I will continue to unequivocally denounce these actions and all who participated in these riots. Today’s vote to impeach the President, without even a single hearing, is unprecedented and simply more of the same divisiveness - making no effort to heal our wounds.
“It’s time for our Nation to move forward to find solutions to our problems, continue our efforts to protect our liberties, and build on our collective successes. The American people are frustrated, hurting, and tired of the nonsense seen every day in Washington - on both sides of the aisle. We must do better for the sake of our great Republic.""

Dear Lindsey,
 
I want to make sure you are aware that the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) is re-opening to provide new and second-round PPP loans.

 
This past Monday, January 11, the program re-opened to small businesses who have not already secured an initial PPP loan. And starting today, January 13, small businesses that have already received a PPP loan are eligible to apply.
 
To find out if you’re eligible to apply for an initial PPP loan, click here. For a copy of the initial PPP loan application, click here. To find out if you’re eligible for a second PPP loan, please click here. For a copy of the second PPP loan application, click here. For answers to frequently asked questions, click here. To connect with a local Small Business Administration (SBA) counselor, click here. The SBA will accept PPP Applications through March 31, 2021.
 
In New York's 19th Congressional District, over 9,100 small businesses utilized the PPP in the first round of loan disbursement, helping keep over 73,000 workers on the payroll.
 
After conversations with NY-19 residents, I introduced legislation to authorize new and second-round funding through the PPP to the hardest hit small businesses. I am proud that my bill was included in Congress’s bipartisan COVID-19 relief package and is now helping provide critical funds to small businesses across our district.
 
I will continue fighting to ensure NY-19 small businesses get the resources they need to survive this public health crisis.
 
Stay safe and healthy.
 
Sincerely,
Antonio

1/13/21 11:30,Donald Trump must be impeached,"￼

Dear Neighbor,
 
Today, the House of Representatives will act on the most serious and solemn of our Constitutional duties. We will vote to impeach President Donald J. Trump for his incitement of an insurrection at the US Capitol. 
 
This is not a decision that I, nor any member of Congress, take lightly. But there is no doubt that it must be done for the sake of our democracy and for the safety of our people.
 
On that note, I'd like to share with you my full statement in support of impeaching President Trump:
  
We are tasked with the solemn duty to take the first step to right the wrongs we witnessed one week ago today. An act of terror was unleashed on our Capitol -  the cradle of democracy - during a sacred act in the peaceful transfer of power. What we all lived through in those hours must not go unpunished. Members and staff forced to flee and hide from rioters. Windows shattered, doors ripped off their hinges, and messages of hate painted on the walls. Police officers beaten with the American flag, while the Confederate flag was triumphantly marched through the Capitol. And when the smoke cleared, five lives, including a Capitol Police officer, were tragically cut short.  
 
There were many bad actors that stormed the Capitol, and sadly, there are some in Congress who helped stoke the flames and spread the lies that gave birth to the insurrection. There will be time to address that, and we must. But today, our judgement must be on the horrific misconduct of President Donald J. Trump. 
 
I will not turn a blind eye to the President’s behavior and culpability for inciting this assault. In the leadup to the election and in its aftermath, he peddled outrageous lies, attacked our democratic institutions, demagogued state election officials, maligned poll workers, and tried to coerce those in power to overturn election results. When that didn’t work, he called for violence, telling his supporters – including the Proud Boys and the Far-Right -  “We fight, we fight like hell, and if you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore.” So they took his orders and attacked this institution – a coequal branch of government. Even as the mob desecrated the halls of Congress, President Trump called Senators to pressure them to challenge the electoral college vote count. 
 
Some of my friends on the other side of the aisle, including the ones who perpetrated this big lie, have called for unity.  Well I ask, where were those calls for unity when Joe Biden won? Where were the calls for unity when a mob tore through these hallowed halls? Even in the aftermath of that destruction, these same individuals chose, once again, to bow to an unworthy president. 
 
Before we can have unity we must first have justice. President Trump has torn apart our nation, attacked our democratic institutions, damaged our standing in the world, and now ends his term with a violent insurrection. America will endure long past Donald J. Trump. But history will judge us and how we acted. We answered the call when we reconvened last Wednesday and at 3:32 Thursday morning finished the certification of election results in the House chamber. Now we must finish our work, and once again impeach this unfit president.
  
Please continue to take care of yourselves and each other, and remember that my office is here to help. Be sure to visit the COVID-19 page on my website for more information and resources. If you have any questions or concerns, or if you need assistance, please don't hesitate to call us at (703) 256-3071.

Congressional Report
 
 
Dear Friend,
 
My top priority is to save lives and rebuild our economy by making sure communities in my district, and across the nation, have access to COVID-19 vaccines, PPP and their direct payments. However, we cannot address these critical issues if there continues to be violence to our way of life.  
 
Last Wednesday's breach of the Capitol was not only dangerous and heartbreaking to witness, but it was especially horrific to see that the president's rhetoric helped incite this violence. In his final days as president, it is clear that he is unfit to adhere to the oath of office - 'preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States'.
 
This is why I have traveled back to Washington DC to call on the Vice President to invoke the 25th amendment as well as stand with my colleagues in supporting articles of impeachment. 
 
We will not let this lawlessness deter us from fulfilling our constitutional duty and on Jan. 20th, America will see a peaceful transfer of power.

1/13/21 10:59,Reminder: Moving Forward,"
 
 
 

January 10, 2021
 

Dear Friend, 

Early last Wednesday, I was diagnosed by the House Physician with COVID-19, and was told that I must immediately quarantine. As such, I was not present for the debate and the vote on the Floor regarding the certification of electoral votes.

Obviously the events of last week were very troubling. Let me first say in unequivocal terms that violence is never justified. I have strongly condemned it when it occurred on the left, and with equal vigor, I condemn what took place last week. While I support the Constitutionally-protected right to a peaceful protest, the lawless images we saw of people ignoring law enforcement directives, battling with authorities and vandalizing public property were a stain on our democracy. As we work to ensure accountability for all those who committed these criminal acts and investigate the planning failures that allowed such an incident to occur, I remain grateful to all the brave men and women who serve in the Capitol Police Department. My thoughts and prayers are especially with the family and friends of U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died as a result of injuries sustained during the attack. May his service and sacrifice never be forgotten and may his memory be eternal! 

The time has now come to move forward and act upon the lessons that we have learned from this experience. The entire 2020 election has shed light on the fact that many states in our union need to review and improve their election laws in order to restore greater confidence in the integrity of our process. Because of these concerns, I joined my colleagues in signing on to the amicus brief asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of the changes that were made to election processes in several states. Transparency is key. I was a Member of the Florida Legislature during the 2000 Presidential election which was also wrought with problems. We did important work after that election to modernize and strengthen our elections’ procedures. Florida should serve as a model for other states moving forward, and I am exploring legislative remedies for achieving this paramount goal. 

Regardless of how we feel about the 2020 election or which candidate we supported, the long-term success of our country is dependent on our willingness to work together for the greater good. We have serious problems that require the attention of thoughtful, principled, solution-oriented leaders. I remain committed to working in such a manner as we prepare for a peaceful transition of power later this month. I especially look forward to working with my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee on stopping the overreach of Big Tech in silencing the viewpoints of all Americans. All of my constituents can be assured that I will continue to defend conservative principles and work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle as we seek free-market solutions to restore our way of life, rebuild our economy and renew the American dream.

Please continue reading for a brief overview of important public information.  

Ensuring the Rule of Law

I am glad to see the state of Florida taking action to crack down on violent protests and protect funding for law enforcement. Violence, especially against our first responders, must never be tolerated.  Anyone who engages in this type of activity must be held accountable. The rule of law must prevail!  
 
 

Providing Relief to Small Businesses

I know many local small businesses are in desperate need of relief. The Small Business Administration has extended the deadline to apply for an Economic Injury Disaster Loan. Click here to learn more. 

Here is also some updated information about the second round of Paycheck Program Protection loans for small businesses. As a reminder, business owners apply for this assistance directly through his/her lender. 
 

Protecting Consumers

Last week, the Combating Pandemic Scams Act, which I co-sponsored, was signed into law. The bill requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), in consultation with relevant agencies, to inform the public about mail, telemarketing, and internet scams related to COVID-19. Additionally, the FTC must establish a national database of this information and also provide information on how to report COVID-19-related scams to the appropriate agency. Especially during times of crisis, we must protect vulnerable populations from exploitation.

According to the Pasco County Health Department, someone created a FAKE Eventbrite account and has been charging seniors to register for the COVID-19 vaccination. This despicable, criminal act is an awful example of exploiting the elderly and must not be tolerated. I trust law enforcement is working to apprehend those responsible and hold them accountable for their egregious offense. I am aware that many people in Pasco are having difficulty obtaining a vaccine slot due to the limited available supply, and I’ve relayed these concerns to state and local leaders. However, as of right now, the Pasco County Health Department has confirmed that the only way to register is by visiting this website and clicking on the link that says Vaccine Distribution. If you are on the correct site, you will not be charged to sign up for the vaccine, as it is free of charge.  
 

Offering Direct Relief to Americans Impacted by the Pandemic 

I’ve received many questions about the newly extended unemployment benefits for those who remain unemployed due to the pandemic. The state recently shared the following guidelines for accessing these benefits. 

	•	The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity has now provided additional weeks for nearly one million claimants who have not previously exhausted their federal benefits before December 26, 2020. These individuals should receive notification through their CONNECT account regarding benefits for those additional weeks. 
	•	Claimants who exhausted their eligible weeks of benefits under the CARES act and are unemployed after December 27, 2020 will be able to request benefit payments soon. 
	•	The Governor has waived the waiting week requirement and work search/work registration requirements through February 27, 2021.
	•	For more information, please visit the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity’s website. 
 
 

The IRS has also announced that it has finished processing the second round of Economic Impact Payments. Below, it has provided answers to frequently asked questions. Additionally, the IRS is encouraging Americans to visit the Get my Payment Tool to receive the most up-to-date information about their payment. 

	•	I didn’t receive a direct deposit yet. Will I get a second Economic Impact Payment? 

Maybe. IRS updated Get My Payment (GMP) for individuals who are receiving the second Economic Impact Payment on January 5, 2021. If you checked GMP on or after January 5 then: 

	•	If GMP reflects a direct deposit date and partial account information, then your payment is deposited there. 
	•	If GMP reflects a date your payment was mailed, it may take up to 3 – 4 weeks for you to receive the payment. Watch your mail carefully for a check or debit card. (See the FAQ for EIP Card) 
	•	If GMP shows “Payment Status #2 – Not Available,” then you will not receive a second Economic Impact Payment and instead you need to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit on your 2020 Tax Return. 

Because of the speed at which the law required the IRS to issue the second round of Economic Impact Payments, some payments may have been sent to an account that may be closed or, is or no longer active, or unfamiliar. By law, the financial institution must return the payment to the IRS; they cannot hold and issue the payment to an individual when the account is no longer active. If Get My Payment shows “Payment Status #2 – Not Available” you will not receive a second EIP.  The IRS advises people that if they don’t receive their Economic Impact Payment, they should file their 2020 tax return electronically and claim the Recovery Rebate Credit on their tax return to get their payment and any refund as quickly as possible. 

	•	What if I have a different bank account than I had on my 2019 tax return. What should I do? 

If the second Economic Impact Payment was sent to an account that is closed or is no longer active the financial institution must, by law, return the payment to the IRS, they cannot hold and issue the payment to an individual when the account is no longer active. The IRS advises people that if they don’t receive the full Economic Impact Payment they should file their 2020 tax return electronically and claim the Recovery Rebate Credit on their tax return to get their payment and any refund as quickly as possible. 

	•	Why can’t the IRS re-issue the second Economic Impact Payment to me? 

The IRS is working hard to deliver the second Economic Impact Payment quickly, as required by law, while still preparing for the upcoming 2021 tax filing season. Due to the compressed timeline, the IRS is unable to reissue and mail checks and instead encourages people to file their 2020 tax return electronically to claim and receive the Recovery Rebate Credit quickly as possible.

	•	Can I call the IRS, software company or bank to resolve issues with my Economic Impact Payment?

This column by HHS Secretary Alex Azar outlines the steps the federal government is taking to improve the vaccine distribution process and ensure that the vaccine is able to efficiently inoculate as many Americans as possible. 

Many seniors in Pasco, Pinellas and Hillsborough counties have reported difficulties registering for a vaccine. I have shared your feedback with state and local officials, and have been assured they are working on improvements. As they work to strengthen this process, I will ensure they have continued federal support. In the interim, you can sign-up for text messages to get the most updated vaccine information available. 
 

Celebrating Epiphany
 
﻿While last week’s Epiphany celebration in Tarpon Springs was limited to parishioners due to safety concerns, I hope all of my Orthodox brothers and sisters enjoyed the sacred celebration. May the joy and hope that accompanies this holy day stay with each of you throughout the year. A special congratulations to diver Colten Sakadales on retrieving the blessed cross at the celebration. Many blessings to him and his family!
 
 

Raising Awareness

January is Human Trafficking Awareness Month. The Pasco County Commission on Human Trafficking has prepared this public service announcement to spread information about how we can all take simple steps to help stop this horrific crime.  
 
 

Constituent Corner

I recently received this note from a constituent who lives in Dunedin.

Thank you for helping me get in touch with the state unemployment office. Prior to contacting your office, I had spent hours on hold trying to get through with no luck. Your staff filed a help ticket for me and a few days later I received a call from someone at the state office who helped me figure out what I needed to do. These extra payments will help my family over the next few weeks. 

This is just one example of the work we do each day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!

Sincerely,

1/13/21 8:55,Why I’m voting to impeach,"￼
Dear Friend,
 
Later today, I will vote to impeach Donald Trump for incitement of insurrection. I believe it’s my obligation to tell you why this step is necessary.
 
For more than two months, the President has used his platform as the leader of our nation to spread dangerous lies regarding the results of the 2020 presidential election. He repeatedly used rhetoric designed to divide the American people and rile up his base. And he even went so far as to pressure Georgia’s Secretary of State into finding votes to overturn their election results.
 
That alone was a despicable abuse of power.
 
But he didn’t stop there. President Trump spent weeks telling his supporters to flock to Washington to help overturn the will of the American people on January 6th, and when he addressed the crowd last Wednesday, he told them to go to the United States Capitol and “fight like hell” on his behalf.
 
Thousands of his supporters descended on the Capitol where they assaulted police officers, vandalized the building, hunted down elected officials they felt were disloyal to the President, and attacked our democracy. In short, it was a failed insurrection, a failed attempt to overturn your votes and overthrow our government.
 
As I told you last week, the President bears direct responsibility for the attack and should have resigned that same evening. Knowing that he would never willingly give up power, Vice President Pence should have invoked the 25th Amendment to remove him from office.
 
Since neither the President nor his Vice President are capable of putting the future of our Democracy ahead of their own political ambitions, I will vote today to impeach Donald Trump for inciting an insurrection.
 
This article will pass the House, and it will do so with Republican support. Then it will be up to the Senate to uphold their constitutional obligation to try and convict this President and bar him from ever tarnishing the Office of the Presidency again.
 
Thank you for your trust in me to do what’s necessary to protect our Democracy and to send a clear message to future presidents that this kind of behavior has no place in our nation.
 
Sincerely,

 
￼

1/12/21 18:28,Impeachment: I want to hear from you,"￼


Dear Friend,

On Jan. 6, 2021, a violent mob incited by the President of the United States tried to obstruct the democratic process and overturn a free and fair election. Although we came together to uphold our oath and to certify the election results later that evening, this deadly attack on the U.S. Capitol was a threat to the very fabric of our nation.

This week, an article of impeachment against the President will be considered by the U.S. House of Representatives.

I believe Congress has a moral and constitutional obligation to provide a check and balance on the President and we should impeach him, but I also want to hear from you before the vote. Listening to you, the people I represent, is one of the most important parts of my job, so I want to hear your thoughts as we move forward in this process. 
￼

Rest assured I will uphold my oath to preserve and protect the Constitution of the United States.
Sincerely, 
￼
Stephanie Murphy

BROADBAND 
Take a Speed Test Here. 
The sad fact is that many places in West Virginia simply do not have access to reliable broadband and the lack of access affects West Virginians every day. Back in 2015, the FCC released a coverage map that stated 99.9% of Americans had wireless coverage. I knew then what I know now: That is just plain wrong. 
HOW MAY WE HELP YOU? 
To request assistance from my case team, click here.  As your U.S. Senator, I am proud to be your voice with government agencies during your time of need. My goal is for me and my staff to provide the best possible customer service for every West Virginian who contacts me needing assistance. While I have no direct jurisdiction in legal or administrative matters of any federal, state, or local agency, I welcome the opportunity to assist you in any way possible and to assure that full consideration is given to your case. See one of our success stories below: 
  
Mr. Jackson Irick of Glen Fork worked for 22 years in a union mine, and qualified for UMWA pension, but was told he did not qualify for the hospital/medical benefits.  As a result of Caseworker Sylvia Asbury’s inquiry, Mr. Irick was able to appeal the decision, and was notified that he will begin receiving medical benefits through the UMWA, and has been able to plan his retirement with his wife.

JANUARY 11, 2021: MANCHIN MEETS WITH SECRETARY OF DEFENSE NOMINEE AUSTIN  Charleston, WV – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, met with Secretary of Defense nominee Retired General Lloyd Austin.     ""As a former Governor, I understand how critical it is for the President to choose their cabinet. General Austin bravely served our nation for over four decades and has proven he is a dedicated American who will lead the Department of Defense with experience and leadership. President-elect Biden has selected him to fulfill the position of Secretary of Defense because he fully believes General Austin understands the role of our military in subordination to civilian command. After meeting with him today I am convinced of that as well, and I believe the Senate should move to confirm General Austin as Defense Secretary on day one of the Biden Administration. I look forward to working with him and my colleagues to strengthen the United States’ role as the hope of the world.”

MANCHIN URGES ADMINISTRATION TO IMMEDIATELY ADDRESS COVID-19 VACCINE DISTRIBUTION ISSUES  Charleston, WV – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) led 45 Senators in urging U.S. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar to take immediate action to fix the significant issues of the COVID-19 vaccine distribution as coronavirus cases continue to climb. The Senators called on the Administration to work and communicate with state, local, Tribal, and territorial governments, vaccine and PPE manufacturers, public health experts, and healthcare providers to develop a plan for COVID-19 vaccine distribution and administration.  The Senators said in part, “We write to you with concerns about significant challenges in COVID-19 vaccine distribution and administration across the country and to outline key actions the Trump Administration should have taken—and must now take—to address these challenges. With our health system and economy in crisis, and millions of lives at stake, we cannot afford for this vaccination campaign to continue to be hindered by the lack of planning, communication, and leadership we have seen so far.""

1/12/21 17:00,Tonight: An Address to the District on Facebook Live,"￼
 
Dear Friends,  I would like to start out by saying thank you for the support I’ve received over the past few days since the attack at the Capitol. I relied on my military training to keep calm during those moments of chaos, but I remain deeply disturbed by the events that took place on Wednesday. I was in the House Gallery when armed rioters tried to breach the chamber. Five people are dead, including a Capitol Police Officer, and many more lives were put in danger.  Insurrection is defined as “a violent uprising against an authority or government.” That’s what we saw on Wednesday: an attack on our democracy and the U.S. Congress. The insurrection accentuated the fragility of our democracy and the dangerous impact of the President’s and Republican leadership’s actions.  Members of Congress were not deterred. Despite being attacked hours earlier, we reconvened and carried out our constitutional duty of certifying the election of Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States. Now, we embark on measures to ensure that no one is above the law.  Tonight at 6:00 pm, I will be addressing NJ-11 via Facebook Live to discuss last week’s events, what Congress is doing now to hold those responsible accountable, and my thoughts on what we need to do next to strengthen our democracy and support our next president. I hope you’ll tune in.  All the best, 
￼
Mikie Sherrill

""Trump fueled the attacked on the United States Congress with the hate-based rhetoric we have witnessed from his bully pulpit and social media accounts, since day one in office. Enough is enough and through his reckless engagement and provocation of his supporters, his actions lie at the heart of Wednesday's violence and the lives that were lost as a result of it. President Trump and any individual, including those who serve in elected offices, should be investigated and held fully accountable.""

President Donald J. Trump knowingly and purposefully incited a violent and unlawful insurrection at the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021. The Espaillat Resolution calls for an investigation of any individual who participated in, aided, or abetted the violent attack and urges they be prosecuted to the fullest extent under the laws of the United States and be brought to justice.

Beatty Bill Helping Veterans Experiencing Homelessness Becomes Law  Congresswoman Beatty is the original author of the Homeless Veterans Legal Services Act

The Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020, H.R. 7105, was recently signed into law. The bipartisan-backed piece of legislation includes a provision that mirrors U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty’s (OH-03) bill, the Homeless Veterans Legal Services Act, H.R. 716, to allow the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to partner with public and private entities to increase access to legal services for homeless veterans and those at-risk of homelessness. This is the sixth bill authored by Beatty to be signed into law.
“Our nation made a lifelong commitment to our veterans, and clearly we can and must do more,” Beatty said. “Providing expanded access to free, high-quality legal services—to prevent eviction or the loss of their home, restore their driver’s license, or resolve child support issues, to name a few examples—is one way we can do so immediately.” Beatty continued, “This bill reaffirms the promise to serve those who answered the call to serve in the Armed Forces.”
“Thank you, Congresswoman Beatty, for your work to develop and pass this critically important bill. Your support for and advocacy of Veterans mitigates critical gaps for service members in need. Your unwavering commitment to Veterans ensures our nation provides resources to assist those who selflessly served our country,” National Veterans Memorial and Museum President and CEO Lt. General Michael Ferriter added.
“We owe a tremendous debt to the brave men and women who risked it all for our country. This law change is critical because it means the VA will now be able to directly fund civil legal services that help our homeless and at-risk veterans resolve the myriad of civil legal challenges that stand in their way of living stable, healthy, and financially secure civilian lives,” Ohio Access to Justice Foundation Executive Director Angela M. Lloyd noted.
Prior to H.R. 7105 becoming law, the VA was only authorized to fund legal services through the Supportive Services for Veterans Families (SSVF) program and the Grant Per Diem (GDP) program. Yet, a 2018 Community Homelessness Assessment, Local Education and Networking Groups Survey (Project CHALENG Survey) showed that legal assistance accounted for four of the top ten unmet needs for both male and female veterans, highlighting the drastic need to expand access to services.

Coronavirus Update

On Monday, Michigan reported 4,536 new cases of COVID-19 and 47 new deaths, bringing the state’s total cases to 523,618 and deaths to 13,401. Michigan’s chief doctor, Dr. Khaldun, is warning that we are at a pivotal moment in Michigan’s fight against the coronavirus. “The declines we were seeing prior to the holidays seem to be reversing,” she said. If you traveled during the holidays, it is important to get tested and follow CDC guidelines to prevent potential spread.
Vaccines are continuing to be delivered to states. On Monday, Michigan reported 829,200 COVID vaccines have been distributed and, of that, 233,085 vaccines have been administered. Michigan ranks 11th in the U.S. for the number of first doses that have been administered. To speed up vaccinations, on Friday, Gov. Whitmer announced that Michigan will expand vaccination eligibility to Michiganders 65 and older, frontline workers, and teachers and childcare providers.
President-elect Biden will hit the reset button on the Trump Administrations vaccine rollout plan, or lack thereof. Rather than holding back vaccines for second doses, the Biden Administration will move to make reserved vaccinations immediately available for more Americans to receive their first dose. Most health experts agree this is the right move to speed up vaccinations and bring this terrible time to a close.

House Plans Vote Demanding Pence Seize Trump’s Powers – New York Times
 
 Legislative Update

￼

Last Wednesday, the symbol of Democracy in the U.S. was violently attacked as Members of Congress were meeting to perform our sacred duty of certifying the 2020 Presidential Election. The attack on the Capitol, incited by Donald Trump, was not an act of patriotism – it was an act of terrorism. Trump has shown time and time again that he is unhinged and unfit for office. The violence caused by his rhetoric demands immediate and aggressive action.
On Monday, House Democrats introduced a resolution calling upon Vice President Mike Pence to immediately invoke the powers of the 25th Amendment, to remove Donald Trump from office until the new administration is sworn in. Additionally, Democrats have also introduced an impeachment resolution, charging President Donald Trump with inciting a deadly insurrection attempt at the U.S. Capitol last Wednesday.
The House will vote on the 25th Amendment Resolution today and the impeachment resolution tomorrow.
With deep sadness for our country and the state of our democracy, I will be supporting these efforts to remove Trump from office and transfer the powers of the presidency to Vice President Pence until the new administration is sworn in. Trump poses a clear and present danger to our nation as he becomes more unhinged in the waning days of his administration. He must be removed from office and barred from ever holding public office again.

 COVID Vaccinations
 
Michigan is busy at work distributing and administering COVID vaccines. On Friday, the state expanded eligibility to receive the vaccine. More information on vaccinations can be found by visiting https://www.washtenaw.org/3269/COVID-19-Vaccination.

Be safe, Michigan! Wear your mask, keep your physical distance, and wash those hands!
Sincerely,
￼
Debbie Dingell

Hi there, 
 Last week cemented the legacy of Donald Trump‘s presidency as the most destructive in our nation’s history, inflicting serious damage on our democratic institutions, our international standing, and our national psyche. Our task now is to prevent further damage and hold accountable those who participated in the attack on the US Capitol to make sure this kind of violent insurrection never happens again  I am on my way back to DC now to hold this president accountable and I just wanted to share my thoughts with you on the events that took place.   On January 6, 2020, I was prepared to join members of Congress to participate in the ceremonial counting of the certified results of the 2020 Presidential Election and confirm that the American people had decisively chosen President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris to lead our nation.   Instead, Republican members of Congress chose to hijack this constitutional process and engage in a political charade to humor a president who has refused to concede that he lost both the popular and electoral college vote by wide margins. Those members decided to buy into the President’s desperate and increasingly unhinged claims that the results of the election were suspect, and, at his urging, challenged the duly certified electoral votes of several states that he had lost, including Pennsylvania.   One of the more bizarre aspects of the decision of the President’s GOP allies is that they were challenging the very ballots that secured their own elections. But the real evil of that decision is that their cowardly efforts to please a president who only considers his own self-interest fueled the flames of hatred and lies that caused the attack on the Capitol on Wednesday.   Last Wednesday, I spent the morning in (virtual) meetings with the Pennsylvania delegation and my staff to prepare our response to the baseless challenge to Pennsylvania’s electoral college votes. Though the President’s claims of illegal votes or fraud had been rejected by dozens of courts, including his hand-picked Supreme Court, we anticipated that his allies would challenge the electoral college votes of up to seven states. We also knew that the President had been urging his supporters to come to DC for “wild” protests on January 6, and that previous Trump rallies had resulted in late-night violence in DC, so I arrived at the Capitol with food and clothing for two days, in case I had to sleep over in my office.   It never occurred to me that I, or the people who work every day in our nation’s capital, would be in physical danger.   That realization quickly changed following the start of the electoral college ceremony The electoral college ceremony began at 1:00 PM. At the other end of the mall, Trump and his allies were holding a rally in which they were repeating the lie that the election had been stolen from him via a variety of unproven conspiracy theories. I decided to watch via CSPAN in my office so that I could continue to work on my remarks, and because COVID restrictions limited the number of people in the chamber.   Arizona was the first state to which the President’s allies objected in the vote count. I leaned in to watch the arguments, but it quickly became apparent that something was wrong.   First, I started receiving emails that some nearby office buildings were being evacuated. Then, some of my colleagues and staff began texting photos and videos of people who had been at Trump’s rally breaking down metal protest barriers at the Capitol. While I was looking at those texts, the House debate stopped and Speaker Pelosi was taken to a more secure location. When debate resumed, Chairman Jim McGovern was in the Speaker’s Chair, and I noticed that some of the members who were speaking sounded nervous.  Suddenly, the House recessed and the screen went blank. My phone started blowing up with texts, emails, Facebook messages, and even LinkedIn inquiries, from family, friends, and colleagues asking what was going on, and if I was safe. I honestly didn’t know what was happening. I started receiving messages from security that there was an internal threat in the Capitol complex, that we should lock doors, move away from windows and doors, be quiet and turn off any devices that might alert the intruders to our whereabouts. This continued every half hour or so for the next eight hours.   My office does not face the Capitol, so it was difficult to directly observe what was happening. I could see Trump supporters walking on the street with their flags and MAGA hats, but saw little evidence of the violence and mayhem at the Capitol until busloads of police and the national guard started pulling up, and I heard explosions as the police detonated suspicious packages (some found to be containing explosive devices) in the area. After moving office furniture and copiers to create barricades in front of the doors, and assembling a cache of makeshift weapons, I spent the afternoon and early evening reassuring my family, answering messages, checking in with colleagues, and seeking more news.   Once the police and national guard gained control of the situation, my colleagues and I turned our focus to how soon we could resume the electoral college vote count. We all felt an urgency to finish the job that the rioters had tried to stop.   We weren’t sure if the halls were fully secured when the debate resumed around 9:00 PM, so I walked over to the Capitol with colleagues. While it is not unusual to see people in uniform on the Hill, now the halls were filled with members of the National Guard. I passed bruised and bandaged members of the Capitol Police and spoke with a young man who had suffered a concussion.   When we got to the House floor, my usual entrance was blocked. A woman was shot there when she and other rioters began breaking windows and doors to force their way into a room where members of Congress and staff were sheltering. Windows were also broken at the main entrance, where the President enters for the state of the union, but police in the chamber had been able to block that entrance and hold off the rioters until everyone was safely out. When I arrived at the House floor, the incredible staff members, most in their 20s, were back at their posts, but many looked truly distraught; one young staffer had red-rimmed eyes and appeared to be in shock.   We debated the trumped-up challenge to Pennsylvania’s electoral votes at about 2 am, and by 3:30 am, Joseph Biden had been declared the President-elect. Despite the trauma and shame of the day’s events, 139 Republican members of the House of Representatives and eight senators still voted to overturn the election.   In the days since the attack, we have learned a lot about why it happened. We know that the President encouraged his supporters to come to DC, and once there, he and his allies whipped them into a frenzy with a toxic mix of lies and disingenuous appeals to patriotism. Trump directed his supporters to march to the Capitol and fight to overturn the electoral college votes. He told them that the Vice President had betrayed him and, in doing so, placed at risk the lives of the Vice President, his family, every member of Congress, and the hundreds of people who go to work on the Hill every day. And when the violence of the attack became clear, he failed to call off his mob for hours or to take other action to defend our government. Instead, he told the mob that he loved them, repeated his lies about a stolen election, and continued his efforts to overturn the clear will of the people.   Wednesday’s attack on the Capitol has now claimed the lives of at least six people, including two brave Capitol Police officers who fought to protect our democracy. Dozens more were seriously injured. Congressional employees, including young aides, custodians, and cafeteria workers, were traumatized. But for the bravery of some key individuals and a lot of luck, it could have been much worse. But for the COVID pandemic, there would have been thousands of visitors, and staff, in the Capitol too.    I want to thank everyone who has reached out for your words of kindness for myself, my staff, and my colleagues. Your messages and calls of concern and support meant so much to all of us during this incredibly challenging time. But even more, I want to thank you for your recognition that this was wrong.   Wednesday was one of the darkest days in our nation’s history, the culmination of our founders’ darkest fears, in which a president led an attack against our own government, aided and abetted by the dangerous rhetoric and actions of members of Congress, and carried out by a mob convinced that their actions were justified because the president lied to them.   This president is a clear and present danger to our country and he must be removed from office, as soon as possible. I have called for his immediate removal through either resignation, invocation of the 25th Amendment, or impeachment.   There must be accountability -- and I will do everything in my power to hold those responsible accountable.   I will make sure to keep you posted as these proceedings progress.   Thank you for taking the time to read this message.  Sincerely,  Mary Gay

I’m a farmer. A third-generation, Big Sandy farmer brought up on Montana values.
It’s also the honor of my lifetime to represent the good people of Montana and those Montana values in the U.S. Senate. To walk the halls of the Capitol building and to stand on the Senate floor is a sacred responsibility that has humbled me from the beginning. 
So it was truly gut-wrenching to witness last week's attack on the United States Capitol. This act of terrorism was an affront to the rule of law and an assault on our democracy. Regardless of your personal views or where you call home, this attack weakened us in the eyes of our foreign adversaries.
We must prioritize our national security in this time of crisis by coming together as Americans. We have faced threats to our democracy before, and there are threats that still remain. But Americans are made of tough stuff, and I know that if we work together, we’ve got it in us to take on any challenge. Now is the time to heal our divisions and work together to solve the pressing issues facing this country.
January 6th was a dark day, there is no getting around that fact. If we are going to leave our kids and grandkids a better future, we need to pull together and put our country before politics. And as long as I have the honor of walking through the halls of our Capitol, know that I’ll continue to fight for you and represent our Montana values as best I can.
I know America is still the best country in the world. We’ve just got to put in the work to keep it that way.

Adriano Espaillat (NY-13). 

""I encourage all small businesses in my district that are still in need of recovery assistance to apply today. My office is here to assist with the process and my team is ready to help businesses receive the support and assistance necessary to rebuild.""

How Can I Help?
Friends, 
With the recent passage of the COVID-19 relief bill, hardworking North Carolinians will receive another round of direct payments in response to the coronavirus pandemic. I want to make sure you have the most up-to-date information on when and how you might receive yours. 
Who will receive a direct payment? 
As of December 29th, the U.S. Department of Treasury started sending $600 stimulus checks to individuals, $1,200 for married couples, and $600 per child for eligible taxpaying Americans who qualify.  
What is the income threshold? 
Individuals who have an adjusted gross income for 2019 of up to $75,000 and married couples who filed joint returns up to $150,000 will receive the full amount of the second payment. Those above this threshold will see a reduced amount. 
How can I check to see if I am receiving a direct payment?

If you are eligible and did not receive your first direct payment, or the second direct payment by January 15, you will be able to file for the Recovery Rebate Credit when you file your 2020 taxes. The IRS recommends filing your 2020 taxes as soon as possible.
I am a Social Security recipient. Will I receive a direct payment? 
If you are on Social Security retirement or disability, you do not need to do anything additional to receive your direct payment.

￼ 
Dear Friends,
By now, many of you have heard and read of the tragic and disturbing attack that took place at the U.S. Capitol last Wednesday. You have viewed the horrifying video and photographic images. I am deeply saddened and outraged by the actions of those involved in this uncivil and devastating act.  I condemn the rioters’ destruction, mayhem, and malice towards the peaceful conduct of the business of democracy in the People’s House. We are a nation of law and order, and it was disgraceful that the safety and security of citizens and the historic structure that houses the first branch of government were needlessly put at risk.  Make no mistake that the Founding Fathers foresaw an event like this that occurred on Wednesday. They anticipated the unrest that follows when the legislative branch holds too much power in determining who serves as the president and vice president of our country.  The dissemination of the misleading perception, by the president and others, that Congress somehow could overturn an election was reckless. This view does not align with the U.S. Constitution. The framers of the Constitution carefully debated and designed our system whereby the president would be elected under rules determined by the individual states and with electors selected in the states. This diffusion of power in separating Washington from the selection of the president was set to prevent the boiling over of passion and heat that we watched unfold on January 6th. Faithful to the U.S. Constitution, which I took an oath to uphold, I voted to uphold the results of the Electoral College, which were certified by the individual states on December 14, 2020. Please see my statement from the morning of January 6th HERE.  I have listened carefully to central Arkansans and their concerns about election security, and I can assure you that election integrity is one of my top priorities for the 117th Congress. I support the idea of a federal commission to review the November 2020 election, assess procedures and any irregularities, and make recommendations to the states for any needed reform. As I have said on CNBC, Fox Business, and local television, we must have faith in our government; we must have faith in our election results. Elections are the cornerstone of our democracy, and if we wish to preserve our democracy, we must ensure that all our citizens have confidence in our electoral process.  For generations, the United States of America has witnessed a peaceful transition of power on Inauguration Day; it’s a hallmark of our society and our nation and a day that sets us apart from oppressive and unstable nation-states. As we move toward the executive transition at noon on January 20th, I am preparing my work with the new 117th Congress and the incoming administration to expand opportunity for all of our families, bolster our national security, and provide American leadership on the global stage. These goals reflect the values of the hardworking women and men of central Arkansans who sent me to Washington – this is especially important as we work to rapidly distribute the vaccines, defeat the menacing coronavirus, and restore our economy and prosperity. Thank you for the many expressions of support and concern that I received from folks across Arkansas and the nation. Please keep our country in your prayers. 

COVID-19 VACCINE UPDATE

As vaccines continue to be distributed across Arkansas, learning how and when can you get your COVID-19 vaccine is critical to defeating this virus. 
Governor Asa Hutchinson has laid out a detailed plan, which can be found HERE.
Please adhere to these key updates to the vaccination process:
VACCINATION FACTSHEET
As of January 5th, the vaccine is available to 73 of the 75 Arkansas counties. 
When can I get the vaccine?
-        Phase 1-A: High-priority healthcare workers, first responders, long-term care workers, and residents.  There are an estimated 180,000 Arkansans in this category, and the goal is to complete this phase by the end of January.
-        Phase 1-B:  Arkansans 70 years of age and older, frontline essential workers (for example, school staff, postal workers, grocery store workers, childcare workers, etc.).  There are an estimated 400,000 Arkansans in this category. The goal is to start and complete this phase in February.
-        Phase 1-C:  Arkansans between 65-69 and between 16 and 64 years of age with high-risk medical conditions, as well as additional essential workers.  The goal is to start this phase in April.
Where can I get vaccinated?
-        Phase 1-A.  Vaccinations for healthcare workers and first responders are currently available at select hospitals and community pharmacies. Others in this phase should contact community pharmacies available HERE.  Call your local pre-approved pharmacies to schedule the first dose; the second dose can be scheduled once the first dose is complete.
-        Phases 1-B and 1-C. Vaccines will be distributed at community pharmacies and certain hospitals. These phases will require a private-public partnership with state agencies.
-        The Arkansas Department of Emergency Management (ADEM) and Arkansas National Guard, along with other partners, will release a logistical plan for vaccinations on or by January 15, which will be made public and available on ADH’s website.
Can I choose which vaccine I receive?
-        At this time, you’re unable to choose which vaccine you receive, but both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccinations have been found to be safe and effective.
How much does the vaccine cost?
-        Through Operation Warp Speed, the cost of the vaccine is covered in full by the government, but there is an administration cost. 
-        However, CMS is acting to cover the administration cost in full and at no cost to you.

DISCUSSING COVID RELIEF WITH ARKANSAS CPAs

Last week, I had the opportunity to meet with Certified Personal Accountants (CPAs) in Arkansas to discuss the most recent COVID-19 relief bill.  

I appreciate the time that this group dedicated to sharpening their knowledge on the updated loan processes of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), Economic Impact Disaster Loans (EIDL), and the newly created rental assistance program.

These programs will serve to provide much-needed aid to Arkansas families, small businesses and their employees, and the hard-working men and women of Arkansas. 

Providing long-lasting and impactful support to Arkansans is a top priority as we move into the 117th Congress. 

￼

ATTENDING THE ICBA THINKTECH ACCELERATOR KICK-OFF EVENT  Last week, I was able to able to kickoff, via video, the 3rd Annual ICBA ThinkTECH Accelerator. It is an honor to have innovators and leaders such as The Venture Center, global financial services technology, and FIS in the second district.
The Think TECH Accelerator allows community banks to help propose fintech solutions and come together with ideas to take the future of banking forward through innovation.
I am especially excited for the exceptional 10 companies that have chosen Little Rock as their home and working hub for the next 12 weeks. With a revitalized and growing downtown area, access to tech talent, low cost of living, our superb outdoor recreation areas, Little Rock is fast becoming a technology hub.   
￼


LAW ENFORCEMENT APPRECIATION DAY


It is critical to note the importance of building and investing in positive community models. The work that organizations do to contribute to improving the quality of life in the central Arkansas region is important and doesn’t go unnoticed. One of the key players in building and keeping a positive community is law enforcement. 

Each day, I am reminded of the sacrifices the men and women of our law enforcement agencies make to keep us safe.

Last Saturday was National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, and I took that time to reflect on the dedication of those officers who commit to keeping our friends, families, and communities safe.

I had the opportunity to speak with Brian Osmundson at the Little Rock Police Department to let him and his fellow officers know just how much I appreciate their service to central Arkansas. 

The tireless effort that these men and women put into their work deserves our utmost respect, and I would urge you to show appreciation to these hard-working individuals whenever you are given the opportunity.

PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROTECTION PROGRAM LOANS EXTENDED

Thanks to the recent COVID-19 relief bill, which passed Congress with my support, $284 billion in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans will be reopened and available to struggling small businesses across the country this week. 

The PPP program has been extended until March 31, 2021, and creates a process for small businesses or non-profits to can receive a “Second Draw PPP Loan” of up to $2 million if the entity (i) has fewer than 300 employees and (ii) can demonstrate a reduction in gross receipts of 25% when compared to a corresponding financial quarter of 2019; (iii) creating a simplified PPP loan forgiveness application for loans under $150,000. Small businesses that never previously received a PPP loan can also apply.

The Small Business Administration and the Treasury Department announced last Friday that Paycheck Protection Program loans would be available to First Draw PPP loan applications starting today, January 11, and second draw PPP loan applications on January 13 from participating CFIs, which include Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), Certified Development Companies (CDCs), and Microloan Intermediaries.

The program will be open to all participating lenders shortly thereafter. 
For more information on the Paycheck Protection Program and other resources for small businesses, visit the SBA website HERE. 



OPEN HEALTH INSURANCE ENROLLMENT

Last week, the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service sent an estimated 8 million Economic Impact Payments (EIPs) in the form of prepaid debit cards.

If you did not receive an EIP as a direct deposit, make sure to check your mail carefully for a check or a prepaid card.

These prepaid cards are contained in envelopes that display the U.S. Department of the Treasury seal. The EIP card will have the Visa name on the front of the card and the issuing bank name, MetaBank, N.A., on the back of the card. 

More information about receiving EIPs in the form of debit cards and checks can be found HERE. 

Sincerely,
￼
Representative French Hill

Kansas Common Sense  January 11, 2021
Hello,  Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them. 
  
Condemning the Violence & Destruction at the U.S. Capitol 
The violence and destruction that occurred at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday was completely unacceptable and unpatriotic, and I condemn it in the strongest possible terms. It was a sad day for our nation, and it was an unwelcome reminder that our democracy is fragile.  I extend my sincere gratitude to all the law enforcement officers who worked to keep all congressional members and staff safe during the breach. My deepest sympathies are with the family, friends and colleagues of U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick who gave his life defending our U.S. Capitol and our democracy. We must never forget his sacrifice and work to quickly bring to justice those responsible for his death and the harm caused to other law enforcement officers. My heart also goes out to the family and friends of Officer Howard Libengood who died on Saturday after serving as a Capitol Police officer for 15 years.  God Bless the U.S. Capitol Police and our law enforcement officers. 
  
Certifying the Electoral College 
On Tuesday, I released the following statement regarding the joint session of Congress to count the results of the Electoral College:  ""I am a conservative Republican. Therefore, I must strictly adhere to the United States Constitution. The Constitution clearly limits the role of Congress with respect to presidential elections to the counting of electoral votes that have been certified by the states. The states, consistent with the principles of federalism and a limited national government, possess the sole authority to determine and submit their electors. To vote to reject these state-certified electoral votes would be to act outside the bounds of the Constitution, which I will not do.  President Trump had every right under the Constitution to challenge the results of the election in the courts, and I publicly supported his right to do so given the allegations and reports of irregularities and fraud. But in every instance, the judgments were clear, and no judge or Supreme Court justice – including those appointed by President Trump – determined there was evidence sufficient to change the results of the election.  Support of the institutions and legal processes established in the Constitution by those who founded this exceptional American Republic are necessary to preserve our most cherished American values. Voting to object to the electoral process without a constitutional basis to do so may be expedient and lead to short-term political benefits for some, but would risk undermining our democracy – which is built upon the rule of law and separation of powers. No victory for one’s cause today can be worth what we would lose tomorrow.  On Wednesday evening, following the events and violence that befell the U.S. Capitol during these constitutionally-mandated proceedings, my Senate colleagues and I returned to the House chamber to finish the counting of the Electoral College votes. At 3:40 a.m. EST, Vice President Pence announced the state of the vote for the 2020 Presidential election, certifying President-elect Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 Presidential Election. 
  
Convening the 117th Congress 
This past Sunday, January 3, 2021, Congress officially convened for its 117th session, an event that has taken place every two years since America’s first official Congress commenced in 1789. Newly elected members took their oaths of office to defend and uphold our Constitution, serve their fellow Americans, their states and districts. 
  
Legislation to Improve the Lives of Veterans Signed into Law 
On Tuesday, the President signed into law the Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act of 2020. This comprehensive legislation is the culmination of more than two years of bipartisan work, with input from our veteran service organizations, dozens of senators and members of the House and our partners at the VA. This legislation combines more than 34 separate bills to address veterans’ needs across a wide range of benefits and services.  This law invests in the GI Bill and economic opportunities for veterans so they can realize the American dream they fought to defend on our behalf. This includes preserving education benefits during and after the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as expanding job training programs for veterans pursuing technology careers. This legislation will also give VA the tools it needs to serve veterans at risk of homelessness during the pandemic and increase legal protections for veterans receiving benefits and care from VA. It also includes provisions from the Deborah Sampson Act, a landmark bill that makes it clear that women who serve their country in the armed forces must have a VA that is as effective for them as it is for men who have served.  Enacting this law is another step in the ongoing efforts to ensure that veterans receive the right benefits and the right care at the right time in order to maximize their ability to achieve success after service. I look forward to this law being faithfully implemented by the VA, and I commit to monitoring their progress in that effort. 
  
￼ 
  
Speaking with Department of Defense Secretary Nominee Lloyd Austin  
This week, I met virtually with General (Retired) Lloyd Austin, President-Elect Biden’s nominee for Secretary of Defense. We spoke specifically about the role Kansas plays in defense manufacturing and technology research, as well as Kansas’ military bases and research facilities. I was pleased to hear that General Austin has existing relationships with some of our Kansas military leaders, including Lieutenant General James Rainey, the commander of the Combined Arms Center and Fort Leavenworth, and Brigadier General Douglas Sims, commander of the First Infantry Division and Fort Riley. He also spoke fondly of former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, a great Kansan I hold in high regard. My Senate colleagues and I will continue to learn more about General Austin during his confirmation hearings in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

￼ 
  Dear Lindsey, 
I join our community members as we continue to grapple with last week's attack on our U.S. Capitol, the physical embodiment of our democracy. Since Wednesday, our office has received over 25,000 messages from concerned neighbors about how we move forward as a nation. As I said last week, there is such division in this country, and I believe that we must do everything in our power as elected leaders to heal this nation. I am committed to that healing process. 

The issues we face are complex and deserve thorough, thoughtful consideration. Hearing directly from you enables me to best represent our community in Congress, which is why I hope you'll join me tomorrow, January 12 at 7:00 PM, for a Telephone Town Hall. I am inviting you, constituents of the Pennsylvania Sixth, to ask questions and share your thoughts with me about our plans to uphold the Constitution and defend our democracy. Anyone can participate by dialing (855) 731-4616. If you are unable to attend, we will share an audio recording to social media in the coming days.

 .  .  .

￼

.  .  .

If you haven't seen, please watch as I share my thoughts regarding the attack on our U.S. Capitol and my responsibility as our Representative here.

Thank you for taking the time to engage with me. I want to hear from you. I will use your feedback to best serve our community. As always, you can send us your full thoughts here. 

Respectfully,

Tragedy for our Nation   Last week was one of tragedy for our country, and I continue to pray for healing for our great nation. I am thankful for the brave men and women who fought to keep us safe in the Capitol last week, and am grateful for those who worked tirelessly to put the Capitol back together again.   Even when we disagree on issues, Congress is still a group bonded together with the united purpose of serving the American people. I will fight for this purpose and continue to do what is right for the people of South Carolina.   The President’s call for a smooth and peaceful transition of power is an important reminder that we owe it to each other and to future generations to remain focused on healing and uniting for this purpose. We owe this to each other and to future generations. Now is the time to come together and turn beauty for ashes. We must all, including myself, choose daily to be a part of the solution; this is what leadership looks like. Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats seem intent on further dividing our nation by once again impeaching the President. A peaceful transition is what our nation needs to start healing - it is what the President has now promised, and what we must all work together to achieve.   The decision by various social media platforms decision to ban the president does not fit this call for unity, and I am fighting to reform section 230. It is not their place to pick who can and cannot speak.   Election Integrity Commission   On Tuesday, I introduced a bill to establish the 2020 Bipartisan Advisory Committee. This committee is charged with the responsibility to examine the integrity of the November 2020 election. The genius of the American experiment is the ability to freely question our processes and build upon lessons learned. We cannot move forward without looking back and scrutinizing the issues that led to millions of Americans losing trust in our election system. This committee will study how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the election, the scope of fraudulent voting, and practices for how to raise public confidence in our voting system. 
Sincerely,

￼
￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ 

Dear Lindsey: 
This past week, our democracy was tested as it never has been before when President Trump incited an insurrection and attempted to overturn the results of a free and fair election. This President remains an immediate threat and is unfit to be in office a moment longer. For this reason, I proudly support several impeachment resolutions to bring him to justice and prevent him from ever abusing his office again.  
To discuss this process and how we protect our democracy, I will be hosting a town hall TOMORROW at 2:00 p.m. PT on Zoom. To join this important conversation and submit a question, RSVP here or by clicking the image below. You will receive a link to join the Zoom event before the town hall.

PRESS RELEASE
For Immediate Release
January 11, 2021


More Than 450 Bipartisan Bills Passed in the House During 2020

#ForThePeople

Dear friend,

The House of Representatives passed more than 900 bills over the past two years, including bipartisan legislation to clean up government, defend access to affordable health care, respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, lower prescription drug costs, protect immigrants, and support policies to create jobs and bring greater economic security to constituents throughout New York's 13th congressional district and families across the nation. 

I am particularly proud of my successful efforts to provide grants of up to $10,000 to small businesses suffering from the pandemic, as well as H.R. 3870, which passed in both the House and the Senate and was signed into law to rename the U.S. Post Office at Audubon Avenue and West 165th Street in recognition of the late Normandía Maldonado, a community organizer, cultural pioneer and activist. I was also able to secure funding for many key federal programs and saw a number of my legislation pass in the Democratic-controlled House. I am proud my constituents have given me the opportunity to return as their representative in Congress, and I will continue these and other efforts over the next two years.

Below is a snapshot of legislation the House has passed to address the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as some of my key legislative wins during the 116th Congress.

ADDRESSING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
Since the onset of this pandemic, House Democrats have acted swiftly to address its catastrophic impacts on both the economy and on public health. The House has passed major legislation including:  • H.R.6074, Coronavirus Preparedness and Response Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2020 • H.R.6201, Families First Coronavirus Response Act • H.R. 784, Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act  • H.R. 266, Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act  • H.R. 6800, Heroes Act  • H.R.7301, Emergency Housing Protections and Relief Act  • H.R. 7027, Child Care Is Essential Act  • H.R. 7327, Child Care For Economic Recovery Act • H.R. 925, Updated Heroes Act  • H.R.133, Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2021 
￼
ESPAILLAT BILLS PASSED IN THE HOUSE:  I was proud to secure House passage of three additional bills over my past term in Congress aimed at helping victims of natural disasters secure housing assistance, investing in small businesses, and promoting security in the Caribbean and stemming the flow of illegal drugs into the United States:  • H.R. 2914, Housing Survivors of Major Disasters Act of 2020 • H.R. 7703, Caribbean Basin Security Initiative Authorization Act • H.R. 4387, To establish Growth Accelerator Fund Competition within the Small Business Administration, and for other purposes  ESPAILLAT FEDERAL FUNDING VICTORIES:  Here is a snapshot of funding I was able to secure in federal appropriations bills on behalf of my constituents that impact families around the nation. Click here for a full list of my legislative activities during 2020.   • $14.4 million for body-worn cameras for border agents to ensure greater transparency and oversight of immigration enforcement agencies, building on $21 million secured last year.  • $15 million increase in the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI), bringing that project to nearly $75 million total, to combat drug trafficking, promote social justice, and increase public safety and security in the region.   • $2 billion for the Capital Investment Grants program, which will provide the federal portion of funding for the Second Avenue Subway Phase II Extension project. This comes in addition to more than $2 billion secured last year.   • $46.5 million for a National Science Foundation grant program specifically for Hispanic-serving colleges and universities to expand opportunities in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). This comes in addition to $45 million achieved last year.  • Funding for the National Institutes of Health that includes resources for an array of specialized research programs such as the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for cancer research; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS); National Institute on Mental Health (NIMH) for the BRAIN Initiative; Precision Medicine Initiative; and, Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot Initiative.   • $21 billion for the WIC Farmers Market Nutrition Program, which helps those participate in the WIC nutrition assistance program purchase fresh produce from locally sourced farmers markets. This is a $2.5 billion increase over the previous year.  I will continue working across the aisle in the House to get things done for constituents of New York's 13th congressional district, and I look forward to working with the incoming Biden-Harris Administration.  Sincerely, 
￼

Más de 450 proyectos de ley bipartidistas aprobados en la Cámara durante 2020

#ForThePeople (#ParaLaGente):


Apreciado amigo,

La Cámara de Representantes aprobó más de 900 proyectos de ley en los últimos dos años, incluida una legislación bipartidista para limpiar el gobierno, defender el acceso a la atención médica asequible, responder a la pandemia de COVID-19, reducir los costos de los medicamentos recetados, proteger a los inmigrantes y apoyar políticas para crear empleos y brindar mayor seguridad económica a los constituyentes en todo el distrito congresual 13 de Nueva York y las familias de toda la nación.

Me siento particularmente orgulloso de mis exitosos esfuerzos para otorgar subvenciones de hasta $10,000 a las pequeñas empresas que sufren por la pandemia, así como por el proyecto de ley H.R. 3870, que se aprobó tanto en la Cámara como en el Senado y se convirtió en ley para nombrar la Oficina Postal de los EE.UU. en la avenida Audubon y West de la calle 165 en reconocimiento póstumo a Normandía Maldonado, organizadora comunitaria, pionera cultural y activista. También pude asegurar fondos para muchos programas federales clave y logré que varias de mis legislaciones fueran aprobadas en la Cámara controlada por los demócratas. Estoy orgulloso de que mis constituyentes me hayan dado la oportunidad de regresar como su representante en el Congreso, y continuaré con estos y otros esfuerzos durante los próximos dos años.

A continuación, una instantánea de las legislaciones que la Cámara aprobó para abordar la pandemia de COVID-19, así como algunas de mis victorias legislativas clave durante el Congreso 116º.

PARA ABORDAR LA PANDEMIA DEL COVID-19

Desde el inicio de esta pandemia, los demócratas de la Cámara de Representantes han actuado rápidamente para abordar sus impactos catastróficos, tanto en la economía como en la salud pública. La Cámara ha aprobado importantes leyes que incluyen:

• H.R.6074, Ley de Asignaciones Suplementarias de Preparación y Respuesta al Coronavirus, 2020
• H.R.6201, Ley Familias Primero de Respuesta al Coronavirus
• H.R. 784, Ley de Ayuda, Alivio y Seguridad Económica por el Coronavirus (CARES)
• H.R. 266, Programa de Protección de Cheques de Pago y Ley de Mejora de la Atención Médica
• H.R. 6800, Ley de Héroes
• H.R.7301, Ley de Ayuda y Protección de Emergencia para la Vivienda
• H.R. 7027, Ley el Cuidado Infantil es Esencial

• H.R. 925, Ley de Héroes Actualizada
• H.R.133, Ley de Asignaciones Suplementarias de Respuesta y Alivio al Coronavirus, 2021

PROYECTOS DE LEY DE ESPAILLAT APROBADOS EN LA CÁMARA:

Me llenó de orgullo asegurar la aprobación en la Cámara de tres proyectos de ley adicionales durante mi mandato anterior en el Congreso, destinados a ayudar a las víctimas de desastres naturales a obtener asistencia para la vivienda, invertir en pequeñas empresas, promover la seguridad en el Caribe y contener el flujo de drogas ilegales a los Estados Unidos:

• H.R. 2914, Ley de Vivienda para Víctimas de Grandes Desastres de 2020
• H.R. 7703, Ley de Autorización de la Iniciativa de Seguridad de la Cuenca del Caribe
• H.R. 4387, Para establecer Competencia en Financiación como Acelerador de Crecimiento dentro de la Administración de Pequeñas Empresas, y para otros fines

VICTORIAS DE ESPAILLAT EN FINANCIACIÓN FEDERAL:

Aquí hay una instantánea de los fondos que pude asegurar en los proyectos de ley de asignaciones federales en nombre de mis constituyentes que afectan a las familias de todo el país. Haga clic aquí para obtener una lista completa de mis actividades legislativas durante el 2020.

• $14.4 millones para cámaras corporales para agentes fronterizos a fin de garantizar una mayor transparencia y supervisión de las agencias de control de inmigración, sobre la base de los $21 millones obtenidos el año pasado.

• $15 millones para la Iniciativa de Seguridad de la Cuenca del Caribe (CBSI), lo que eleva ese proyecto a casi $75 millones en total, para combatir el tráfico de drogas, promover la justicia social y aumentar la seguridad pública en la región. 

• $2 mil millones para el programa de Subvenciones para Inversión de Capital, que proporcionará la porción federal de fondos para el proyecto de Extensión de la Fase II del Subway de la Segunda Avenida. Esto se suma a los más de $2 mil millones asegurados el año pasado.

• $46.5 millones para un programa de subvenciones de la Fundación Nacional de Ciencias, específicamente para que las universidades de dos y cuatro años que sirven a los hispanos amplíen las oportunidades en los campos de ciencia, tecnología, ingeniería y matemáticas (STEM). Esto se suma a los $45 millones logrados el año pasado.

• Financiamiento para los Institutos Nacionales de Salud que incluye recursos para una variedad de programas de investigación especializados como el Instituto Nacional del Cáncer (NCI) para la investigación del cáncer; Instituto Nacional de Trastornos Neurológicos y Accidentes Cerebrovasculares (NINDS); Instituto Nacional de Salud Mental (NIMH) para la Iniciativa BRAIN; Iniciativa de Medicina de Precisión; y la Iniciativa Beau Biden Cancer Moonshot.

• $21 mil millones para el Programa de Nutrición del Mercado de Agricultores de WIC, que ayuda a quienes participan en el programa de asistencia nutricional de WIC a comprar productos frescos de los mercados de agricultores de origen local. Este es un aumento de $2.5 mil millones con respecto al año anterior.

Continuaré trabajando más allá de lo partidario en la Cámara para obtener logros para los constituyentes del distrito congresual 13 de Nueva York, y espero con entusiasmo trabajar con la Administración entrante de Biden-Harris.

Sinceramente,

￼

Congresman Donalds' Weekly Wrap-Up 
 
 
My first week as a United States Congressman has been a historic week for our nation. Growing up in the inner city in Brooklyn, New York, I've seen violence, and I've seen mobs, but never in a million years did I think I'd see it in the halls of Congress. I came to Washington, D.C, to serve the people of Florida's 19th Congressional District. I am deeply saddened that the violence that ensued distracted me from doing so. As a nation, we must come together and take part in a healthy debate on the issues and always remember that more that unites us than divides us.  
 
As a Congressman, my priorities are serving Southwest Florida with honor by defending their conservative values, protecting our waterways, following the Rule of Law, and abiding by the Constitution.    I am looking forward to the next two years and all of the good we will accomplish together. 
 

 
 
Violence on the Capitol
 
On my fourth day as a United States Congressman, I followed Capitol staff into a safe room with a gas mask in hand rather than representing my consitutents. I am deeply sadded and heartbroken over the violence and destruction that occurred on the United States Capitol on January 6th. The United States is a nation of law and order, and that will not waiver. There is no place for violence and upheaval in this country. Read my full statement on the violent protests below.

Objecting to the Electoral College Certification
 
On January 6th, I voted alongside the Consitution to object to the certification of the Electoral College. Every Floridian and American deserves to believe that our elections result from a transparent and lawful democratic process. I have objected to the certification process on January 6th and will ask legitimate questions to restore faith in our election system.
￼

 
 
Swearing In Ceremony
 
 
On January 3rd, I was honored to take the solemn oath at my swearing-in ceremony as a Member of the 117th United States Congress. It was a joyous day that I was grateful to have my wife, Erika, our boys, and my family by my side. I am eternally thankful to Florida's 19th Congressional District's hardworking people for entrusting me to represent them in the House of Representatives dutifully. I am genuinely grateful to all of my volunteers, supporters, and everyone in Southwest Florida who believed in me and voted me to be their next Congressman. I promise never to stop fighting for conservative values, economic freedoms, school choice, clean water, and everything that makes this country great. .

￼ 
Joni Ernst: What happened at the Capitol ‘is not the America that I know'   We are and forever will be the UNITED States of America, and no difference or disagreement is too big for us to overcome.   As Published In: The Des Moines Register | January 11, 2021   Wednesday was a tragic day in our nation’s history. The very institution that millions of people from across the world revere, visit, and look to for democratic decision-making was pillaged by an angry mob incited by false hope.   To say I’m saddened by what happened is an understatement. I’m furious. This is not the America that I know, that I love, and that I fought for.   In this nation we have a beautiful history of debating and disagreeing on very, very tough issues. We also have a long-standing record of peacefully transitioning power from one administration to the next. And let me be perfectly clear: We will have that again on Jan. 20, 2021, when Joe Biden is sworn in as our next president.   Peaceful protest is a fundamental freedom that Americans are able to enjoy — one that I worked to defend in my 23 years in the military, and that I proudly support. But storming the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to influence elected officials — an insurrection as many have called it — is not, and will never be, a peaceful protest. It is anarchy — and America and her people cannot stand for it in any form.    Last summer, I gave the looting and rioting that swept across our country, from Portland and Seattle to the streets of Washington, D.C, the same label — anarchy. And what I stated then rings true today: Peaceful protesters are being drowned out by the sounds of shattering glass and splintering wood.    I understand that many Iowans are upset with the results of the 2020 presidential election, and that most of these hardworking people would not resort to the violence we saw this week in an attempt to get a different outcome. I’ve received countless calls, texts, emails, and letters from Iowans with real concerns about the integrity of our election system. I hear their voices, and believe we should have a thorough review of this past election — which is why I support my good friend and colleague Sen. Tim Scott’s bipartisan effort to establish a commission to do so.   But there can be no doubt that the violent mob who lawlessly breached the Capitol in hopes of intimidating elected officials and disrupting our constitutional duties are criminals. Blood was shed and lives were lost because of their heinous actions. They should all be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will fight to make sure that happens.    I am gravely concerned that dictators around the world will use last week’s indelible images against us. A divided America is communist China’s dream. They spew propaganda about the United States by portraying us as unstable and undeserving of global leadership. And you better believe there is nothing that Vladimir Putin loves more than to point out the flaws of Western democracy.   It is past time to tone down the rhetoric — from the president down to every single American — and treat each and every human being with dignity and respect. We should once again be able to enjoy a meal around the table with our family, friends, and neighbors without having harsh political debates.   I believe in this country, and what she stands for. I wouldn’t have served in military uniform, local elected office, and now as a United States senator if I didn’t. We are and forever will be the United States of America, and no difference or disagreement is too big for us to overcome.   America, we must always strive to be a more perfect union and to remain a beacon of hope and freedom for people around the globe.

My Thoughts on Last Week
 
 
On Wednesday, January 6, 2021, the House and Senate were set to meet in a joint session of Congress to review the electoral college votes and hold debate on the 50 states' submissions. As we began our debate, the time and place for civil discourse to be center stage were immediately disrupted when protestors broke through barriers and stormed the Capitol building. The pro-democracy and pro-Trump march turned bloody and violent, resulting in the loss of life.
 
What started as an eventful week with the beginning of a new Congress has since been overshadowed by the short-sighted actions of a few bad actors who turned a peaceful demonstration into a violent and embarrassing clash. Breeching the doors of Congress served no purpose, and I vehemently reject this type of behavior. A complete investigation must be conducted, and all individuals involved must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.
 
As Congress resumed its Constitutional duties, I objected to the certification of electoral college votes for Arizona and Pennsylvania. Our efforts were not to overturn the election but to draw serious attention to the perceived unconstitutional acts and irregularities in several states. All Americans deserve absolute faith that the election is free from fraud, corruption, and outside influence – we require the full truth. 
 
Whether we like it or not, Joe Biden is now the President-elect. Joe Biden has promised to heal America and to be a president for all Americans. It is imperative that he live up to this promise. I am asking every American to pray for our current president and our future president with the hope that God will continue to bless our nation so that we may unite to be stronger.
 
We are so fortunate to live in the greatest country on Earth, and I fully understand why half of America is concerned with the future of our country.  I’ve been fighting the left’s radical agenda, and if it is implemented, it will destroy America as we know it. We will no longer stand as a republic but fall to be a third-rate socialist country.
 
There is more that unites us than divides us, and that’s where we must turn our focus. Let’s set politics aside, focus on the American people and sound policy to fix our nation, and preserve its bounty for future generations. 
 
I want to close by recognizing the Capitol police officers and other law enforcement officials who help protect my colleagues' lives and all staff members who were on campus during this time. Please pray for the loved ones of the Capitol Police officers who lost their lives in the wake of this event. Please pray for the protection of our National Guard members who are still deployed in D.C. Lastly, please pray for this nation. We must heal and unite to remain the greatest country in the world.
 
We are one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.
 
In your service,
￼
  
Steven

1/11/21 12:42,ICYMI: Sen. Rick Scott is Fighting to Keep Higher Education Affordable,"￼
 ￼￼￼￼ 
In Case You Missed It! 
U.S. Sen. Rick Scott is Fighting to Keep Higher Education Affordable 
￼
Senator Scott understands that Florida’s students are the future of our nation, and they must be given every opportunity to succeed. With the start of a new semester, Senator Scott is continuing the fight to make higher education more affordable and ensure schools are preparing students for jobs. 
Throughout his time as Governor, Senator Scott had two main higher education goals: to keep college affordable for students and to realign Florida’s higher education system to promote career readiness and skills training. Because of his leadership, Florida now has the second lowest state university tuition and fees in the nation and the U.S. News & World Report has rated Florida in the top five best states for higher education. 
Senator Rick Scott is proud to continue to build on these initiatives in Washington so every student can receive a world-class education that leads to a good-paying job at a price they can afford.

Sen. Rick Scott to Florida Board of Governors: Do Not Raise Tuition on Florida Students 
On November 30, 2020, Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after reports that the Florida Board of Governors is considering a tuition increase for state university students. As Governor, Senator Scott fought to hold the line on tuition by vetoing tuition increases, eliminating automatic inflationary tuition increases, freezing tuition, greatly limiting tuition differential, and appointing leaders who share his goal of providing an affordable higher education to Florida students and families. He also worked to pass several constitutional amendments that make it harder to raise taxes and fees, including requiring 2/3rds of the legislature to vote on a tax or fee increase for it to become law, and requiring a supermajority vote of the State Board of Governors to impose, raise or authorize university fees. As Senator, he is working to keep higher education affordable and make sure students are prepared to get good-paying jobs.  Senator Rick Scott said, “Raising tuition on families is a tax increase. And, it’s a tax increase that harms Floridians’ ability to achieve the American dream of earning a higher-education diploma. As families are still struggling to recover from the coronavirus, leaders in Florida should absolutely not consider raising tuition.  ""Over the last six years of my term as Governor, we held the line on tuition. I asked every person interviewing for appointments to our universities and colleges if they would support a tuition increase. If they said yes, I didn’t appoint them. And if they went against their word, they were not re-appointed. The federal government has spent almost $14 billion in the CARES Act to give higher education institutions the support they need during the coronavirus, and with more classes moving online, university operations costs should be lower. Businesses and families around the country are having to navigate this difficult time – our universities have to do the same and live within their means instead of taking the easy way out and passing the costs on to students. The opportunities and dreams of future graduates are at stake, and we owe it to them to continue our fight against the tax increase of rising tuition.""

Sen. Rick Scott: Taxpayers Win When We Hold Universities Accountable for Student Debt Crisis 
On October 16, 2019, Senator Rick Scott released an episode of his series in partnership with the Heritage Foundation: How Washington Wastes Your Money. 
This episode covers the student loan debt crisis in America. Right now, Americans are $1.6 trillion in student loan debt, and colleges have no incentive to keep their costs low. A college education is becoming out of reach for more and more students – who are losing out on their opportunity to live the American Dream. Just like he did as Governor of Florida, Senator Scott is working on a plan to drive down costs for students and their families, and incentivize colleges and universities to actually prepare students for a job. Holding the entire higher education system accountable means taxpayers get a better return on their investment.

Sen. Rick Scott Announces Proposals to Lower the Cost of Higher Education 
On September 10, 2019, Senator Rick Scott spoke at the Heritage Foundation on the future of higher education and his efforts to keep higher education affordable and make sure students are prepared to get good-paying jobs. During his speech, Senator Scott announced five proposals to lower the cost of higher education for our students.

Sen. Rick Scott: Florida’s Higher Education System Continues to be Best in the Nation 
On September 9, 2019, Senator Rick Scott released the following statement commending Florida’s public universities after the release of the 2020 Best Colleges rankings by U.S. News & World Report.   Senator Rick Scott said, “For years, U.S. News & World Report has rated Florida’s higher education system as the best in the nation, and I want to thank our universities and our students for continuing this success. Our public universities, especially University of Florida, Florida State University and the University of South Florida, continue to score impressive ratings every year. We worked hard in Florida to provide our students with a world-class education that leads to a good-paying job at a price they can afford, and today’s rankings show Florida continues to be a leader in higher education. I look forward to working in the Senate to share Florida’s success with the nation and to make education more affordable for all families.""

Sen. Rick Scott Introduces STEM Act to End Skyrocketing Higher Education Costs 
On September 27, 2019, Senator Rick Scott introduced the Student Training and Education   Metrics (STEM) Act to force universities to take more responsibility when it comes to preparing students for successful careers. The STEM Act is the first proposal in Senator Scott’s plan to lower the cost of higher education and ensure graduates are prepared to get jobs.  Senator Rick Scott said, “I am introducing the STEM Act to offer a solution to make higher education more affordable and ensure schools are preparing students for jobs. Just like I did as Governor of Florida, I’m working to make sure colleges and universities never raise tuition or fees on our students. My STEM Act eliminates all federal funding for institutions that raise tuition, requires standards and metrics for both for-profit and non-profit colleges, and holds colleges and universities accountable for a portion of student loans. The Democrats’ plans to eliminate all student loan debt is a fairy tale that would only make bad behavior worse. Proposals to make everything free seems great, but would bankrupt families. We need to focus on real solutions to bring down the cost of higher education and make sure students are prepared for jobs.""  The STEM Act encourages higher education institutions to prepare students for high-paying jobs by:
	•	Tuition Lock
	•	Put institutions on the hook for student loan debt

Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 1.11.21
Monday, January 11, 2021 –                                 
Priorities for the New Congress
On January 20, Joe Biden will be sworn in as president of the United States. I will attend his inauguration, which I consider one of my duties as a Member of Congress.
I also consider it my duty to conduct rigorous oversight of any Administration to ensure it upholds the Constitution and carries out the laws we enact.
Earlier this year, I was sworn in for a new term. I am honored to represent you for another term in the U.S. House of Representatives.
The new Congress presents a chance to renew my work on priorities for the constituents of Virginia’s Ninth Congressional District.
Improving access to and lowering costs of health care remain among the topmost items on my agenda. The ongoing coronavirus pandemic obviously poses the most significant challenge in the health care space. Monitoring the rollout of new vaccines and therapeutics are a task for this phase of the pandemic, but this same task also points forward to a health care agenda beyond the pandemic.
The development of multiple safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines in Operation Warp Speed was a landmark accomplishment. It came about through a partnership between the Federal Government, private sector, and scientific institutions. Likewise, policies of the Federal Government must be geared toward promoting the development of new cures and treatments for other diseases and medical conditions through cooperation of these various sectors.
At the same time, the high cost of prescription drugs has long been a problem borne by Ninth District residents and a top concern. I have worked throughout my time in the House of Representatives on commonsense measures with bipartisan backing to address this problem.
In the last Congress, the bill passed by House Democrats pursued a different path, purporting to make drug prices affordable but only by a socialistic-style price control scheme that would have stifled innovation and new cures. That bill went nowhere. In this Congress, we have the chance to return to the bipartisan path that addresses costs without sacrificing development of new drugs and treatments.
Before the pandemic, I championed telehealth as a way to provide access to health care to more people, especially in rural and isolated areas such as those found in the Ninth District. The pandemic has increased the use of telehealth and shown just how valuable it can be. I will continue to advocate policies that encourage the use of telehealth to care for patients.
For telehealth to work at its best, communities need reliable internet access. Such access also enables economic growth, educational opportunities, and higher quality of life for residents.
I have supported legislative and regulatory measures that encourage the building out of broadband networks and promote other creative solutions, such as use of TV white spaces and satellite technology, to bring better service to more people. The work of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under outgoing Chairman Ajit Pai has been very beneficial in this effort. I will encourage the FCC to continue its efforts to close the digital divide as well as work on legislation in the halls of Congress.
Job creation and economic growth are essential so constituents of the Ninth District can support themselves and their families, communities can attract new residents, and local jurisdictions can fund their services. In Congress, support for this effort means calling for the right tax and regulatory policies that lead to investment, hiring, and wage growth.
I have introduced legislation on a regulatory change that I believe would support efficiency and productivity in manufacturing. The current New Source Review (NSR) program, meant to prevent pollution emissions from industrial facilities, actually discourages these facilities from making upgrades that would ultimately lead to lower emissions. My bill would reform these counterproductive rules so manufacturers and others can make pollution-reducing upgrades to their facilities without running afoul of the Environmental Protection Agency.
The new Congress and Administration may look different, but my objective in the House of Representatives remains the same: to be a voice for the liberties, priorities, and needs of the people of Virginia’s Ninth Congressional District.

1/11/21 10:02,SBA and Treasury Announce PPP Re-Opening; Issue New Guidance ​,"

SBA and Treasury Announce PPP Re-Opening; Issue New Guidance 

Washington - The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), in consultation with the Treasury Department, announced that the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) will re-open the week of January 11 for new borrowers and certain existing PPP borrowers.

To promote access to capital, initially only community financial institutions will be able to make First Draw PPP Loans on Monday, January 11, and Second Draw PPP Loans on Wednesday, January 13.  The PPP will open to all participating lenders shortly thereafter. Updated PPP guidance outlining Program changes to enhance its effectiveness and accessibility was released on January 6 in accordance with the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Non-Profits, and Venues Act.
This round of the PPP continues to prioritize millions of Americans employed by small businesses by authorizing up to $284 billion toward job retention and certain other expenses through March 31, 2021, and by allowing certain existing PPP borrowers to apply for a Second Draw PPP Loan. 
“The historically successful Paycheck Protection Program served as an economic lifeline to millions of small businesses and their employees when they needed it most,” said Administrator Jovita Carranza.  “Today’s guidance builds on the success of the program and adapts to the changing needs of small business owners by providing targeted relief and a simpler forgiveness process to ensure their path to recovery.” 
“The Paycheck Protection Program has successfully provided 5.2 million loans worth $525 billion to America’s small businesses, supporting more than 51 million jobs,” said Treasury Secretary Steven T. Mnuchin.  “This updated guidance enhances the PPP’s targeted relief to small businesses most impacted by COVID-19.  We are committed to implementing this round of PPP quickly to continue supporting American small businesses and their workers.”
Key PPP updates include:
	•	PPP borrowers can set their PPP loan’s covered period to be any length between 8 and 24 weeks to best meet their business needs;
	•	PPP loans will cover additional expenses, including operations expenditures, property damage costs, supplier costs, and worker protection expenditures;
	•	The Program’s eligibility is expanded to include 501(c)(6)s, housing cooperatives, direct marketing organizations, among other types of organizations; 
	•	The PPP provides greater flexibility for seasonal employees; 
	•	Certain existing PPP borrowers can request to modify their First Draw PPP Loan amount; and
	•	Certain existing PPP borrowers are now eligible to apply for a Second Draw PPP Loan. 
A borrower is generally eligible for a Second Draw PPP Loan if the borrower: 
	•	Previously received a First Draw PPP Loan and will or has used the full amount only for authorized uses; 
	•	Has no more than 300 employees; and 
	•	Can demonstrate at least a 25% reduction in gross receipts between comparable quarters in 2019 and 2020.
The new guidance released includes:
	•	PPP Guidance from SBA Administrator Carranza on Accessing Capital for Minority, Underserved, Veteran, and Women-owned Business Concerns;
	•	Interim Final Rule on Paycheck Protection Program as Amended by Economic Aid Act; and
	•	Interim Final Rule on Second Draw PPP Loans.

Wicker Looks Ahead to New Congress 
Lawmakers Must Unite Around Bipartisan Priorities 
The recent elections in Georgia have produced a major power shift in the U.S. Senate. Both Republican senators lost narrowly to their Democratic challengers, bringing the Senate to an even 50-50 split. As presiding officer, Vice President Kamala Harris will be able to break any tie, allowing Democrats to control the agenda and name committee chairs. This means Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., will become chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and I will be the Ranking Republican. 
It has been 20 years since the Senate last had a 50-50 split. During that time, my predecessor, Trent Lott, was Majority Leader, and Vice President Dick Cheney was the presiding officer. Although Republicans were technically in control of the chamber, strong cooperation across party lines was essential. I hope Americans will see the same level of cooperation that existed then. 
Senate Remains Bulwark Against Liberal Agenda 
The close margin in the Senate means it will be difficult to pass legislation without bipartisan support. This should discourage lawmakers from pushing far-left proposals that do not enjoy broad consensus. My Republican colleagues and I will stand strong against any proposals that could lead our country toward socialism. 
Congress will continue to exercise constitutional oversight of the executive branch, ensuring that federal agencies follow the law. Republicans also recognize the need to restore the American people’s confidence in our election system. My colleagues and I will make a strong push for measures to improve election integrity and transparency. 
In the weeks ahead, the Senate will resume its unique role of vetting and confirming presidential nominees. I take this “advice and consent” role very seriously. I have opposed nominations in the past, and I will support only those nominees who I believe are qualified for the job. 
Continued Work on Commerce Committee 
As the lead Republican on the Senate Commerce Committee, I will continue to shape legislation on a broad range of issues affecting our economy. One of my top priorities continues to be expanding broadband to rural communities. Lawmakers from both parties understand the importance of delivering high-speed internet to every community in America, and I will lead efforts in Congress to expedite making that vision a reality. I also plan to introduce legislation that would attract private investment to rural communities and improve STEM education in rural schools. 
The Commerce Committee oversees our nation’s transportation networks, which are vital to our economy and our vaccine distribution efforts. This Congress, I hope to help negotiate a multi-year surface transportation bill to continue improving safety and provide funding for critical transportation programs, including highway, freight, motor vehicle, and rail programs, such as Gulf Coast Rail. 
States across the country are advancing legislation to allow college athletes to earn money through the use of their “name, image, and likeness” in merchandise. To avoid a confusing patchwork of state laws on this issue, I will help draft legislation to create a national standard. I will also help write legislation to authorize funding for NASA, including Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, and I will keep advocating for data privacy legislation that protects consumers’ personal information. The committee will continue to support the Coast Guard’s polar icebreakers being built by Mississippi shipbuilders in Pascagoula. I will continue working on legislation to promote aquaculture and support Gulf Coast fisheries. And I will keep pushing the Army Corps of Engineers to complete the long-delayed Yazoo backwater pumps and the Pearl River flood control project. There is no shortage of work to be done, and I look forward to producing more results for Mississippi and the American people.

Certifying the Results of the 2020 Presidential Election
A fundamental, defining feature of a democratic republic is the right of the people to elect their own leaders. That feature was on display this week when Congress met to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election. During the certification process, some lawmakers tried, but failed, to overturn the results of the election in Pennsylvania. Nowhere in our constitution is Congress vested with this authority. The people select the president, not Congress.
Even if Congress had the constitutional authority to judge the worthiness of a state's election process-which it does not-rejecting Pennsylvania's electoral college votes would have been wildly out of proportion to the purported election irregularities and very damaging to our nation.
Let's consider some of the arguments that the objectors made. First, they observed that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court disregarded existing law when it ruled that mail-in ballots could be counted even if they arrived up to three days after the Election Day. In my view, the objectors are right about that and the U.S. Supreme Court should overturn that illegal decision. However, late arriving mail-in ballots did not change the outcome of the election in Pennsylvania. Only about 10,000 ballots arrived in Pennsylvania during the three days after the election. Those 10,000 ballots have been excluded from the vote count that resulted in President-elect Biden winning Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes.
Second, the objectors argued that a 2019 Pennsylvania law allowing mail-in ballots for any reason might violate the Pennsylvania constitution. However, this is a bipartisan law that passed with nearly unanimous Republican support. Clearly, Republican state legislators believed that it was consistent with the Pennsylvania constitution. This law was not challenged when it was passed, when it was first implemented during the June 2020 primary, or before the November 2020 general election. It was only challenged after President Trump lost the general election. In that election, 2.6 million Pennsylvanians voters, in good faith, relied on this law to cast their votes by mail-in ballot. I understand there may be a question about the constitutionality of this law that should be decided for future elections. But preventing Pennsylvania voters from participating in this election entirely would be an outrageous remedy to this purported offense. An unanimous bipartisan Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejected this remedy in a legal challenge, with the court's two conservative Republican justices calling it ""extreme and untenable.""
Certainly there were some irregularities in this election, as there always are, but there is no evidence of systemic fraud, conspiracies, or even significant anomalies that cast any serious doubt on who actually won the election.
As Members of Congress did their duty counting and certifying electoral votes, a mob stormed the Capitol and attempted to stop this constitutionally-required process. Tragically, five people died as a result of day's events, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer. While the mob temporarily delayed this process, Congress reconvened that evening and certified that President-elect Joe Biden won the election.
The mob's attack on the U.S. Capitol is a stark reminder of the damage that can result when men in power and responsibility refuse to acknowledge the truth. I hope you will take a few moments to watch the two floor speeches I gave in opposition to the objections:

Dear Neighbor,  How do I begin to write to you about the week we just experienced?  In Washington, as across the country, it was a week unlike any other—and one we must all make sure that we never experience again.  It was just a week ago today that I was sworn in as your representative for the 117th Congress of the United States.  As the Congress began to organize itself this week—adopting the Rules that will govern our work for the next two years and appointing committees to do that work—we knew that the week would include the certification of electoral college results from each state.   What took place on Wednesday shocked the nation and the world.  I wrote to you on Thursday about Wednesday’s events, although to me, it seemed like it was all the same day.  That is because for me, in many ways, it was still the same very long day.  Like many of you, I am continuing to learn about the events of that day—as we all are—from emerging reporting, photographs and footage of what was happening throughout our Capitol.  I am forever in the debt of the Capitol Police officers who saved my life on Wednesday as I sat in the Gallery of the House of Representatives, and I am heartbroken over the deaths of two officers arising from the events that day, and to the many more who were injured and are recovering.  I hope you will keep all of them in your thoughts.  I will share more on my experience and my thoughts with you on these events again very soon.   What we saw in Washington this week represents a real and serious threat to our democracy.  And at the same time, we continue to battle a real and serous threat to our lives and livelihoods presented by the coronavirus pandemic.  I urge you to take all precautions to protect yourself and our neighbors.  The positivity rate in Harris County is 16.5 percent, and there are more than 37,000 active cases in our community.  On Thursday, officials confirmed the first case of the new COVID-19 variant in Harris County, which is also the first case in Texas.  Across Texas, 1 in 5 hospital beds are now occupied by COVID-19 patients.  On Friday, and officials across the United States reported more than 300,000 new coronavirus cases in a day for the first time.   Harris County Public Health has received 10,000 COVID vaccines and is ramping up its distribution efforts.  On Saturday, the Houston Health Department announced approximately 1,000 new COVID-19 vaccine appointments became available for Houstonians who meet the state's Phase 1A and Phase 1B criteria.  All the slots were filled, but additional vaccination opportunities will be posted on HoustonEmergency.org/COVID19 as supply increases.  We are facing unprecedented challenges of enormous scope and importance.  I am honored to represent you, and I hope that, in these difficult times, you will remember that I am here as a resource for you.  My team and I are always glad to answer your questions, listen to your suggestions, and provide assistance whenever possible.  You can contact us at any time by emailing here or by calling (713) 353-8680.  Best wishes, 
￼

￼

1/10/21 21:14,We ask “God mend thine every flaw”,"￼ 

Dear Friends,
 
It was a tumultuous week for our nation. Yet, America has shown her resolve. It is critical that everyone – regardless of political party – work to lower the collective temperature of our political discourse. We must, as Ronald Reagan often said, disagree without being disagreeable. Before any political ideology or persuasion, we are first Americans.
Please join me in praying for our nation and those who lost their lives during the events that unfolded at the Capitol this past week.
Best, Brad

I unequivocally condemn the actions of the criminals who broke into the U.S. Capitol, injured law enforcement, and tried to disrupt the constitutional process. No matter what flag one is carrying, people violating the law need to be held accountable. That is not who we are. That is not what this country stands for. 
The peaceful transfer of power is enshrined in the fabric of our constitutional republic. It is part of what makes America the greatest country in the world. Without it, we are no better than the banana republics from which we seek to protect ourselves and our allies.

I believe there remain constitutional concerns and actual violations regarding election administration. Understandably, many Americans across the political spectrum have concerns about its fairness and accuracy. Unfairness on the part of the media and big tech only exacerbated these concerns, which have been arising over the last two decades.
I am deeply concerned about state officials making changes to their election laws without the consent of their state legislators. This concern has arisen in states won by each candidate.
That’s why I joined with 125 of my colleagues last month in signing the amicus brief that presented election irregularities and asked the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on whether states should be held accountable to the Constitutional prescriptions. It is the body best suited to make that determination of constitutionality. Unfortunately, it refused to hear the case based on standing, though it never heard the arguments or struck down the merits of the questions. The Court has unfortunately left this issue unresolved.
Article II, Section 1, Clause 2 of the U.S. Constitution grants state legislatures sole authority to direct the manner for how its state’s Electors are appointed to the Electoral College. And yet, judges, governors, and other officials in certain states repeatedly made changes to election laws that circumvented the state legislatures.
The discrepancies in these states must be resolved, and the constitutional questions must be answered. Before the election, state legislatures should have exerted their constitutional role to either object to or codify election administration changes. They did not, and they still have not, sadly. The Supreme Court should have accepted the opportunity to hear and rule on this issue, which is why I joined the amicus brief asking the Court to take up the issue and rule definitively. They did not. Presidential campaigns with constitutional concerns should have brought those forth before Election Day. They did not. We as Congress should weigh these constitutional concerns alongside a state’s constitutional role in appointing and certifying their electors.
Two constitutional issues are hitting each other: The non-constitutionality of non-legislative changes to the election and the constitutionality of states choosing their own electors and certifying them.
Specifically, I joined the petition to object to Pennsylvania’s Electors because of clear discrepancies between Pennsylvania’s own state law and how its election was administered. These include judges unilaterally extending certain election deadlines, election officials not requiring signature checks on mail-in ballots, and inconsistent standards from county officials for “ballot curing.” I believe the changes these Pennsylvania officials made without the consent of their state legislators are unconstitutional. In addition, Pennsylvania’s law – Act 77, which expanded mail-in ballots – violates their own Constitution. These issues need to be heard and debated. Objections in the certification process are not unprecedented.
As I understand it, neither Article II nor the 12th Amendment grants Congress the power to overrule the states’ certification of their own Electors. Article II states, in part, “Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors,” and the 12th Amendment states, in part, “The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted; -- The person having the greatest number of votes for President, shall be the President.” Historically, a reason the Electoral Counting Act of 1887 included the ability to object to a slate of electors came from the need to resolve disputes arising from when a single state certified multiple slates of electors. That has not happened in this case. 
One may not like it right now amidst this election, but we would create a dangerous precedent and do harm to the institution of the Electoral College and election process. If either party were to gain a majority in both chambers of Congress, they could simply reject the will of the voters and select their own President.
This is not a decision I have arrived at lightly, and I understand and respect that many of my colleagues may have reached a different conclusion. Our discussions in the House were spirited and sincere, with both sides legitimately standing firmly on constitutional ground with competing interpretations.
The Electoral College is a critical component of our carefully balanced constitutional republic, and we must protect it. Let me be clear: the issues I’ve raised deal not with the institution of the Electoral College but only with how some states have run their elections and selected their Electors. Ultimately, the individual states should and must decide their Electors.
Where Do We Go from Here?
I pledge to work to ensure that these constitutional questions are answered ahead of the next election so that Americans can have faith in our republic as well as clarity as we work to protect the electoral college, our constitution, and our laws. America remains the greatest country in the world. However, we must settle these unresolved questions and restore faith in our election system if we are to live up to the legacy given to us by past generations and sustain the blessings of our liberties for future generations. I pledge to work to ensure these constitutional questions are answered ahead of the next election so Americans have clarity on and faith in our democracy and the integrity of the Electoral College and our Constitution is protected. 
Our government – Congress, the courts, and the states – must work to reach agreed-upon answers to these questions to ensure future integrity of, and faith in, our elections. Ohio has stood as a model in election administration for the 2020 Presidential Election. We did things right. 
I am going to fight to make sure the American people are never in this position again. I support efforts by Senator Tim Scott to establish an Election Integrity Commission to formally investigate the missteps from this election and provide guidance for future elections as both sides of the aisle should want clarity and certainty.  Undoubtedly, more legislation to safeguard our Electoral College and elections will be needed to prevent future irregularities, discrepancies, and constitutional concerns. The American people deserve it.
We can and we must right these wrongs. Like the song ""America the Beautiful"" suggests, we ask that ""God mend thine every flaw.""

1/10/21 17:49,Accountability ,"￼
January 10, 2021
Dear Friend,
I was right there last Wednesday when an angry mob of domestic terrorists assaulted and overwhelmed Capitol Police and stormed the Capitol building. We should all be clear that this happened because Donald Trump willfully incited this mob to riot and for weeks repeated the lies and conspiracy theories that animate them.
So should Donald Trump be impeached? Obviously. Should he be allowed to ever hold office again? Absolutely not. There must be accountability as we hold responsible those who committed these violent acts, those like the President who incited these crimes, and those who enabled the President's worst impulses.
But I want to be absolutely clear that there is a difference between accountability and retribution. I want my country back, not revenge. I am not motivated by the desire to punish this failed President. I am motivated by the desire to turn the page on this dark chapter in our country's history.
To do that, our first and foremost priority must be to respect the will of the voters and to successfully execute the conclusion of the 2020 presidential election.  
The peaceful inauguration of Joe Biden must be our paramount priority as we begin the process of returning this country to its rightful place in the world. Then we must govern and govern fairly, produce results for even the most disaffected, and create opportunities for ALL Americans if we are to begin the process of healing this nation torn asunder.
Sincerely,
￼

Congressman McHenry Weekly Update 


Upholding My Constitutional Duty



In November 2016, I was proud to have supported President Trump as he shocked the world with his resounding defeat of Hillary Clinton. I was even more proud of what he accomplished after taking office. In the face of a majority of Democrats claiming his presidency was illegitimate and the baseless Mueller probe, President Trump got to work for the American people. 

President Trump achieved historic tax cuts, repealed the core of Obamacare and Dodd-Frank, fought unfair trade practices of China, and defended our most sacred ally Israel. I supported and worked to pass his agenda every step of the way—voting with President Trump more than any other member of North Carolina’s Congressional delegation. It was his leadership that brought us the best economy of the last 50 years.

While I am proud to have supported President Trump’s agenda and am honored to have worked with him as he accomplished so much, I could not violate the oath I took to to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. I also worried about the long-term consequences these actions could have on the Electoral College, which the left has been seeking to eliminate for years.  I have no doubt that activists on the left will use Congress’ votes against legally submitted electors as further evidence for why the Electoral College must be eliminated. Please click here or on the image below to read my full statement on why I decided to uphold my Constitutional responsibilities during the electoral college certification last week.

Condemning Wednesday's Violence



The Capitol is our nation’s most remarkable building. It is a working monument to our nation’s founding principles and testament to the freedoms we hold dear. A building which—in normal times—all Americans are invited to visit and experience. What happened there last Wednesday was awful. Seeing Capitol Police attacked as mobs forced their way in, was not something I ever expected to see in this country. There is real frustration, but frustration should be expressed through peaceful protest. All Americans must agree that we can never condone violence. Thank you to the law enforcement officers who helped restore order and continue to protect the building.

￼

I have the honor of interacting with U.S. Capitol Police officers everyday I’m in Washington. They are hardworking, professional, and dedicated to their duty protecting the Capitol, its employees, and all who visit. I am heartbroken to learn that one of these officers—Brian Sicknick—lost his life from injuries sustained in the line of duty during Wednesday’s events. Giulia and I join with the rest of the Capitol community in praying for the family, friends, and colleagues of Officer Sicknick as they mourn this tragic loss. 

￼





Thanking All of Our Law Enforcement



Saturday was Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, a day to recognize our law enforcement for everything they do to keep our communities safe. Please join me in thanking these brave men and women for their service and dedication to our communities. Let us also take a moment to remember U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, Mount Holly Officer Tyler Herndon, and Concord Police Officer Jason Shuping who have all tragically lost their lives recently in the line of duty. Today, and every day, I am thankful for the sacrifices and dedication of law enforcement officers as they work to keep our families safe here in western North Carolina and all across the country. God bless our law enforcement for all you do to protect this great nation.

To the millions who were told to sit down, shut up, and blindly accept the unconstitutionality of the 2020 election: I heard you. I stood for you. I objected for you.

To abdicate that responsibility is a surrender to tyranny.

￼
To watch my floor speech, please click here.

Now, I would like to address the events that transpired on January 6, 2021, as a whole.

The media is attempting to confuse the public regarding objectors and the importance of election integrity for all future elections with the violence that took place in Washington, DC, on Wednesday.

I stand by my objections to the Electoral College count from certain states in the November 2020 election. If we allow representatives of the people to be threatened and accused of treason for carrying out their constitutional duty to ensure free and fair elections, I fear that all of our American freedoms will soon be in danger of becoming nothing more than patriot dreams of the past. I will not be bullied into forsaking the oath I swore to uphold.

If SCOTUS had properly acted and heard the Texas lawsuit, we might have prevented frustrations from festering into the tragic events that took place this week. The American people deserved a decision on the merit of numerous claims of unconstitutionality, irregularity, and fraud. It was their duty. They failed.

I am against what took place on Wednesday inside the Capitol building and the manner in which it occurred. I am also against the vile insults directed toward me and my fellow objectors that slam our integrity and blame us for Wednesday's incidents – especially from those who have condoned and even championed the violent events that have taken place over the last nine months.

My Democrat colleagues offered objections in 2001, 2005, and 2017 when counting the electoral votes – there was nothing treasonous or seditious about it then, nor is there now. The Left cannot call for unity, while also calling for my expulsion from the House of Representatives simply for doing the same thing they have done in every Republican-won presidential election in modern history.

That being said, Congress has spoken and there will be a peaceful transfer of power on January 20, 2021. Regardless of who is in the White House, I will continue to spend every day faithfully serving the people of TX-36 and work to protect this country from the Democrats’ socialistic agenda.

May God bless you always,

￼
Rep. Brian Babin

Condemning the awful violence at the Capitol on Wednesday
￼
Photo via TIME
Let me first and foremost, in the strongest way possible, condemn the anarchy and violence that beset our Capitol on Wednesday. As I have said many times peaceful protests are one of the most meaningful foundations of our democracy. However any type of violence is not to be tolerated. We were having meaningful debate in the House chamber regarding beliefs about the United States Constitution and possible violations of it by certain states. That meaningful dialogue was destroyed and marred by this violence. This is not how America operates. I am ashamed of this horrible behavior.

Objecting to the Electoral College votes of Pennsylvania
It is the duty of the US
 Congress to confirm the votes for the Electoral College. Wednesday's debate
 regarding the Constitutional validity of the electoral process in
 certain states was occurring in an orderly manner until it was abruptly
 interrupted by a group of protestors who overran the Capitol building.
 The debate centered around Article II Section 1 of the US Constitution
 which explicitly states that the state legislature is the
 governmental body that is to make election law. After weeks of dutiful review I
 believe those directives were violated by several states. I previously
 mentioned that it was my intention to object based upon that line of
 reasoning. Two states were objected to by both a House member and the
 required Senate member and they were Arizona and Pennsylvania. After
 the events of the day I was urged by many to not object because of the
 violence. I will say that I will not be dissuaded in my constitutional
 duty by threat or the occurrence of violence. After careful review I
 did not feel that the objections to the Electoral College in Arizona
 fit my objecting criteria and so I did not object for that state. On the
 other hand the egregious actions by the State Supreme Court in
 Pennsylvania did indeed fit those criteria and I objected to their Electoral
 College votes. I performed my Constitutional duty. Objections to the
 Electoral College were made by Democrats in 2000, 2004 and 2016. Those
 objections were constitutional also.

Opposing another divisive impeachment
The lawlessness the world witnessed at the Capitol on Wednesday was an utter embarrassment to the United States of America. Those who participated in the riot should be held responsible and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Thankfully, President Trump has committed to a peaceful transition of power. He spoke to the nation last night asking for peace and unity and support of the new administration. Speaker Pelosi’s intention to prematurely remove him from office is an unnecessary and partisan act which will only further divide our nation. I will oppose any such efforts to remove the president prior to the inauguration on January 20th.

Beginning my first full term
￼
The 117th Congress officially began on January 3rd and I was
 sworn in for my second term as the Representative of the Third District
 of North Carolina. It is such an honor to represent the good people of
 eastern North Carolina in our nation’s capital. Being a voice
 for the Third District is an immense responsibility and I pledge to
 support the conservative agenda on which I campaigned, just as I did in
 my first term. Obviously the first order of business is to work
 diligently in helping our state and our nation survive the pandemic. But we
 cannot forget the other issues that face our district and our nation.
 We have an economy to rebuild, election security to review and foreign
 affairs that need scrutiny. I look forward to meeting with more
 hard-working eastern North Carolinians as I continue to travel the district
 and meet with constituents to learn more about the people and
 interests I will be fighting for in Washington, D.C.

Opposing Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House
I proudly voted for my friend Kevin McCarthy for Speaker of the House at the beginning of the 117th Congress. Nancy Pelosi is unfit to be the leader of the People's House because she is so out of touch with the people themselves. We haven't forgotten how she gleefully showed off her $13 per pint ice cream and $24,000 fridge to her friends in the mainstream media after blocking hundreds of billions of dollars in relief aid for small businesses. More recently, she thought it would be okay to get her hair done in San Francisco while everyone else couldn't.  She has made it abundantly clear that she thinks there are two sets of rules: one for elites like herself and another for everyone else. That might be the case in socialist countries, but it is not the case in the United States. My Republican colleagues and I will stop at nothing to hold her accountable during this Congress.

Democrats recklessly strip minority party rights in the 117th Congress
￼
This week, House Democrats passed H. Res. 8
 - the rules package for the 117th Congress. H. Res. 8 significantly
 alters the Motion to Recommit (MTR), a procedural motion used since the
 very 1st Congress, and one guaranteed to the Minority Party since
 1909. The MTR gives the Minority Party a chance for their voice to be
 heard and is the last chance to amend a bill before it is put up to vote
 for passage. In the 116th Congress, eight MTRs proposed by Republicans
 were passed in bipartisan votes.
Democrats claim to care about diversity, but
 in reality it is diversity in everything except opinion. The 117th
 Congress’s rules package clearly demonstrates that. The MTR gives
 the minority party a chance to put their best foot forward and offer
 bipartisan ideas to improve legislation. Republicans improved eight bills
 last Congress with bipartisan MTR votes, and although that was a boon
 for the American people, it wasn’t for Nancy Pelosi’s
 radical progressive agenda. Her cowardly move is an attempt to protect
 her party from taking hard votes. This action indicates that Democrats
 do not want to be forced to defend their beliefs in the public arena.
 Unfortunately, because of her smaller majority in the House, all Nancy
 Pelosi wants to do is consolidate her power. In reality this is the
 beginning of ushering in one-party rule and subsequently socialism.
 These actions are a blatant attack in suppressing the ideas of the
 Minority Party.
The rules package also institutes speech codes for Members’
 social media pages and ridiculously prohibits members from using words such
 as father, mother, son or daughter on the House floor. The speech
 policing instituted by these rules clearly violates the First
 Amendment.
In
 addition, H. Res. 8 repeals a longstanding rule for certain legislation
 pertaining to COVID-19 and climate change known as PAYGO that requires
 bills to dictate how they will be paid for. The PAYGO repeal is
 irresponsible and indicative that, once again, Democrats don’t want to
 defend their draconian climate change tax and spend measures like the
 Green New Deal for the public to see.
Finally, the rules also provide for
 proxy-voting, which allows members to vote remotely rather than traveling to
 Washington, D.C. Some Democrats don’t even want to show up to do
 their job in Washington in the first place, so they are continuing with
 proxy voting.
This partisan rules package is a disaster
 for the institution of the U.S. House of Representatives and
 it’s a disaster for the American people.

Happy New Years!
￼
Happy New Year! The year 2020 was a year filled with trials and tribulations for everyone. Historians will study the COVID-19 pandemic and our response to it for decades to come. This year has seen plenty of suffering, death and mourning caused by this awful virus.  While some may wholly define this year by the pain caused by the virus, we shouldn't forget about the resolve this great nation showed in the face of so much adversity. Was our response perfect? No, but we did the best we could with the information that was available to us at the time.  The safe and effective vaccines that have been developed in less than a year are nothing short of miraculous, and are the key to getting us back on track in the New Year. Thanks to the COVID vaccine, we have hope for a brighter 2021.

CASH Act
On Monday, December 28th, I opposed increasing stimulus payments from $600 to $2000 on the House floor. The last time stimulus checks went around, many people who did not need the extra cash ended up pocketing their $1200 payment. I am in favor of more targeted relief aid, which is exactly what we got with the increased PPP funds and unemployment that was in the most recent COVID-19 relief package. One time payments give an instant boost of cash. Keeping people on the payroll so they have a steady stream of income is far more useful than providing a one-time payment.
With the amount of money we have spent during this pandemic we cannot continue to carelssly print money without paying for it. It's easy to forget that American taxpayers are the ones who will ultimately need to pay off this debt. As a federal representative, it is my duty to be a responsible steward of American taxpayers' money. That's why I believe we need more targeted relief instead of a handout to the people who don't need it.

Great news
 for Pitt County! Working together with other Congressional and local
 leaders, we were able to help American Airlines reestablish service at
 Pitt/Greenville airport. The travel industry has been hit especially
 hard. People have not been able to travel for business or to see loved
 ones. We hope in the upcoming months life will return to normal and
 people will travel freely once again. Great for the economy of Eastern
 NC.

Friends,
This was a dark week for our nation. It is an absolute tragedy that fulfilling a Constitutional duty led to the violence we saw this week at the Capitol. It is every person’s right to protest peacefully, but there is no excuse for the violence that took place at the Capitol on Wednesday. 
I am thankful for the Capitol Police officers who bravely protected us that day and everyday. Their heroic efforts during the siege on the Capitol will not be forgotten.  Friday was National Law Enforcement Day; may we not forget that Law Enforcement Officers are heroes.

Joint Session of Congress
 
 
I am honored every day to serve the Seventh District of South Carolina. It is my duty to be your voice and your vote in Washington and to defend the Constitution. All Americans should have confidence in our elections.
I attached my signature to five objections to the electoral votes. This was a decision that I weighed heavily, and I waited until the last moment to complete.  Because it is so momentous an issue, I wanted to hear every argument before I decided.   It was perhaps the most difficult decision in my eight years. But, 70% of Republican voters believe the election was not fair.  
I knew that regardless of any objection the votes would be certified. No one in the democratic majority would cross the aisle, and a substantial minority of Republicans had said they would not support objections.  I was angry that the President and some Republican leaders were promoting the lie that if we only fought hard enough he would get 4 more years.
My decision was not based on love or hate of Trump, nor was I trying to play to the base.
Before making a decision to certify or object to the electoral results, I wanted to know two things:
1. Were there proven problems with the election?
2. Did Congress have a role in reviewing the vote since states run their own elections, or was our job merely ministerial?
I read, I researched, and I listened to reasoned arguments by brilliant people on both sides.  I said over and over I would wait until I heard everything before I made up my mind. I was leaning toward not objecting until the night before.  However, in the end two documents cemented my decision to object:
1. A letter received the night before the vote, from the President of the Pennsylvania State Senate objecting to their own electoral vote and outlining problems that occurred in that state 
2. A letter from the Vice President which laid out his view of the role of Congress in the approval of the electoral college vote 
It was apparent to me that the right thing to do was object and make the argument, even knowing it would be defeated. However, our nation is better than the violence displayed in our capital this week. We must do better as a nation to move forward together.

Dear Friend, 

Early last Wednesday, I was diagnosed by the House Physician with COVID-19, and was told that I must immediately quarantine. As such, I was not present for the debate and the vote on the Floor regarding the certification of electoral votes.

Obviously the events of last week were very troubling. Let me first say in unequivocal terms that violence is never justified. I have strongly condemned it when it occurred on the left, and with equal vigor, I condemn what took place last week. While I support the Constitutionally-protected right to a peaceful protest, the lawless images we saw of people ignoring law enforcement directives, battling with authorities and vandalizing public property were a stain on our democracy. As we work to ensure accountability for all those who committed these criminal acts and investigate the planning failures that allowed such an incident to occur, I remain grateful to all the brave men and women who serve in the Capitol Police Department. My thoughts and prayers are especially with the family and friends of U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died as a result of injuries sustained during the attack. May his service and sacrifice never be forgotten and may his memory be eternal! 

The time has now come to move forward and act upon the lessons that we have learned from this experience. The entire 2020 election has shed light on the fact that many states in our union need to review and improve their election laws in order to restore greater confidence in the integrity of our process. Because of these concerns, I joined my colleagues in signing on to the amicus brief asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the constitutionality of the changes that were made to election processes in several states. Transparency is key. I was a Member of the Florida Legislature during the 2000 Presidential election which was also wrought with problems. We did important work after that election to modernize and strengthen our elections’ procedures. Florida should serve as a model for other states moving forward, and I am exploring legislative remedies for achieving this paramount goal. 

Regardless of how we feel about the 2020 election or which candidate we supported, the long-term success of our country is dependent on our willingness to work together for the greater good. We have serious problems that require the attention of thoughtful, principled, solution-oriented leaders. I remain committed to working in such a manner as we prepare for a peaceful transition of power later this month. I especially look forward to working with my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee on stopping the overreach of Big Tech in silencing the viewpoints of all Americans. All of my constituents can be assured that I will continue to defend conservative principles and work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle as we seek free-market solutions to restore our way of life, rebuild our economy and renew the American dream.

Please continue reading for a brief overview of important public information.  

Ensuring the Rule of Law

I am glad to see the state of Florida taking action to crack down on violent protests and protect funding for law enforcement. Violence, especially against our first responders, must never be tolerated.  Anyone who engages in this type of activity must be held accountable. The rule of law must prevail!  
 
 

Providing Relief to Small Businesses

I know many local small businesses are in desperate need of relief. The Small Business Administration has extended the deadline to apply for an Economic Injury Disaster Loan. Click here to learn more. 

Here is also some updated information about the second round of Paycheck Program Protection loans for small businesses. As a reminder, business owners apply for this assistance directly through his/her lender. 
 

Protecting Consumers

Last week, the Combating Pandemic Scams Act, which I co-sponsored, was signed into law. The bill requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), in consultation with relevant agencies, to inform the public about mail, telemarketing, and internet scams related to COVID-19. Additionally, the FTC must establish a national database of this information and also provide information on how to report COVID-19-related scams to the appropriate agency. Especially during times of crisis, we must protect vulnerable populations from exploitation.

According to the Pasco County Health Department, someone created a FAKE Eventbrite account and has been charging seniors to register for the COVID-19 vaccination. This despicable, criminal act is an awful example of exploiting the elderly and must not be tolerated. I trust law enforcement is working to apprehend those responsible and hold them accountable for their egregious offense. I am aware that many people in Pasco are having difficulty obtaining a vaccine slot due to the limited available supply, and I’ve relayed these concerns to state and local leaders. However, as of right now, the Pasco County Health Department has confirmed that the only way to register is by visiting this website and clicking on the link that says Vaccine Distribution. If you are on the correct site, you will not be charged to sign up for the vaccine, as it is free of charge.  
 

Offering Direct Relief to Americans Impacted by the Pandemic 

I’ve received many questions about the newly extended unemployment benefits for those who remain unemployed due to the pandemic. The state recently shared the following guidelines for accessing these benefits. 

	•	The Florida Department of Economic Opportunity has now provided additional weeks for nearly one million claimants who have not previously exhausted their federal benefits before December 26, 2020. These individuals should receive notification through their CONNECT account regarding benefits for those additional weeks. 
	•	Claimants who exhausted their eligible weeks of benefits under the CARES act and are unemployed after December 27, 2020 will be able to request benefit payments soon. 
	•	The Governor has waived the waiting week requirement and work search/work registration requirements through February 27, 2021.
	•	For more information, please visit the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity’s website. 
 
 

The IRS has also announced that it has finished processing the second round of Economic Impact Payments. Below, it has provided answers to frequently asked questions. Additionally, the IRS is encouraging Americans to visit the Get my Payment Tool to receive the most up-to-date information about their payment. 

	•	I didn’t receive a direct deposit yet. Will I get a second Economic Impact Payment? 

Maybe. IRS updated Get My Payment (GMP) for individuals who are receiving the second Economic Impact Payment on January 5, 2021. If you checked GMP on or after January 5 then: 

	•	If GMP reflects a direct deposit date and partial account information, then your payment is deposited there. 
	•	If GMP reflects a date your payment was mailed, it may take up to 3 – 4 weeks for you to receive the payment. Watch your mail carefully for a check or debit card. (See the FAQ for EIP Card) 
	•	If GMP shows “Payment Status #2 – Not Available,” then you will not receive a second Economic Impact Payment and instead you need to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit on your 2020 Tax Return. 

Because of the speed at which the law required the IRS to issue the second round of Economic Impact Payments, some payments may have been sent to an account that may be closed or, is or no longer active, or unfamiliar. By law, the financial institution must return the payment to the IRS; they cannot hold and issue the payment to an individual when the account is no longer active. If Get My Payment shows “Payment Status #2 – Not Available” you will not receive a second EIP.  The IRS advises people that if they don’t receive their Economic Impact Payment, they should file their 2020 tax return electronically and claim the Recovery Rebate Credit on their tax return to get their payment and any refund as quickly as possible. 

	•	What if I have a different bank account than I had on my 2019 tax return. What should I do? 

If the second Economic Impact Payment was sent to an account that is closed or is no longer active the financial institution must, by law, return the payment to the IRS, they cannot hold and issue the payment to an individual when the account is no longer active. The IRS advises people that if they don’t receive the full Economic Impact Payment they should file their 2020 tax return electronically and claim the Recovery Rebate Credit on their tax return to get their payment and any refund as quickly as possible. 

	•	Why can’t the IRS re-issue the second Economic Impact Payment to me? 

The IRS is working hard to deliver the second Economic Impact Payment quickly, as required by law, while still preparing for the upcoming 2021 tax filing season. Due to the compressed timeline, the IRS is unable to reissue and mail checks and instead encourages people to file their 2020 tax return electronically to claim and receive the Recovery Rebate Credit quickly as possible.

	•	Can I call the IRS, software company or bank to resolve issues with my Economic Impact Payment?

People should visit IRS.gov for the most current information on the second round of Economic Impact Payments rather than calling the agency or their financial institutions or tax software providers. IRS phone assistors do not have additional information beyond what’s available on IRS.gov. 

 

Ensuring Access to a Safe and Effective Covid-19 Vaccine

This column by HHS Secretary Alex Azar outlines the steps the federal government is taking to improve the vaccine distribution process and ensure that the vaccine is able to efficiently inoculate as many Americans as possible. 

Many seniors in Pasco, Pinellas and Hillsborough counties have reported difficulties registering for a vaccine. I have shared your feedback with state and local officials, and have been assured they are working on improvements. As they work to strengthen this process, I will ensure they have continued federal support. In the interim, you can sign-up for text messages to get the most updated vaccine information available. 
 

Celebrating Epiphany
 
﻿While last week’s Epiphany celebration in Tarpon Springs was limited to parishioners due to safety concerns, I hope all of my Orthodox brothers and sisters enjoyed the sacred celebration. May the joy and hope that accompanies this holy day stay with each of you throughout the year. A special congratulations to diver Colten Sakadales on retrieving the blessed cross at the celebration. Many blessings to him and his family!
 
 

Raising Awareness

January is Human Trafficking Awareness Month. The Pasco County Commission on Human Trafficking has prepared this public service announcement to spread information about how we can all take simple steps to help stop this horrific crime.  
 
 

Constituent Corner

I recently received this note from a constituent who lives in Dunedin.

Thank you for helping me get in touch with the state unemployment office. Prior to contacting your office, I had spent hours on hold trying to get through with no luck. Your staff filed a help ticket for me and a few days later I received a call from someone at the state office who helped me figure out what I needed to do. These extra payments will help my family over the next few weeks. 

This is just one example of the work we do each day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!

Sincerely,
 

Gus Bilirakis

THE 117TH CONGRESS

As the 117th Congress began this week, the world watched as a mob stormed the United States Capitol. I was on the floor of the United States House of Representatives ready for a critical debate about free and fair elections as the Capitol was breached. I was one of the last to leave the chamber.

This was nothing short of anarchy and I condemn it strongly. 

We lost a member of the Capitol Police due to the violence that day. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died defending the heart of American democracy. He is a hero and we are praying for his family and friends, and all law enforcement.

Congress continued our work for the American people, though. Once the Capitol was secure, we returned to continue our duty of certifying the electoral votes from each state. 

In this episode of Buddy's Briefing, I reflect on Wednesday, explain why I objected to the certification of some electoral votes, discuss the beginning of the 117th Congress, and more.

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCXCIV
Sunday, January 3, 2021:  The 20th Amendment to the Constitution established noon on the 3rd day of January as the initial meeting date of each newly-elected Congress. After flying up this morning, I head to Statuary Hall in the Capitol where I pick up my voting card and other materials. I’m in the House Chamber at noon as we begin the 117th U.S. Congress through a quorum call conducted by the Clerk of the House.  This is one of the rare occasions where each member votes present.  We begin today with 433 members eligible to take the oath of office.  Two seats, NY-22 where the race has still not been called and LA-1 where Representative-elect Luke Letlow (R-LA) tragically died last week, are still empty.  Although a few members are not here - primarily because of COVID-19 - the breakdown at this point is 222 Democratic and 211 Republican. 
￼
Rep. Carter signs the oath of office
Once a quorum has been established, we vote for Speaker and, as expected, Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) is re-elected Speaker.  After she is sworn in by the Dean of the House, Rep. Don Young (R-AK) who has been a member of Congress since 1973, she then traditionally swears in the other members of Congress.  Because of COVID-19 precautions, only new members are allowed to have guests in the balcony.  They are to be sworn in first and the returning members are to be sworn in in groups.  However, a motion is made not to seat the new members from Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin because of election integrity questions in those states.  Immediately after the motion is made, a motion is made to dispense with the measure. That motion to table passes and we continue with the swearing in ceremony.  After I am sworn in by the Speaker, I go back to Statuary Hall where I sign my oath of office.  Later in the afternoon, I have a live interview with Fox News to discuss the Georgia Senate run-off elections to be held on Tuesday.

Monday, January 4, 2021:  After our daily all-staff conference call, I head to the House Chamber for our first vote of the day.  Today is the day that we adopt the rules package that will govern our activities in the House this session. Since the first Congress, the minority party has had the right to recommit a bill to the Rules Committee with instructions to amend it before the House votes on it for final passage.  The Democrats have proposed essentially eliminating this essential minority right.  A motion is made this morning by Republicans to table discussion of the rules package but does not pass, therefore debate continues. Once back in my office, I meet with my senior staff to discuss the issues we are facing this week before meeting with some of my House colleagues to discuss issues.  Afterwards, I head back to the House Chamber where we have our second vote series then, after returning to my office, return to the House Chamber for our third and final vote series of the day.  Later in the evening, I head to the studios of Fox News downtown where I have a live interview to discuss tomorrow's Senate runoff elections in Georgia.

Tuesday, January 5, 2021:  After doing 1020 push ups in 1 hour this morning with my friends and House colleagues Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) and Josh Gottheimer (D-NY), I head to the Capitol Visitors Center (CVC) for our GOP Conference meeting where we discuss tomorrows vote certifying the electoral college from each state.  Next, I join in on a Tri-Caucus (comprised of the Congressional Black-, Hispanic-, and Asian-Pacific Islanders Caucuses) and bipartisan briefing with doctors from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to discuss promoting COVID-19 vaccination and adoption for all Americans. Afterwards, I head downtown to the Fox News studios where I have a live interview to discuss today’s Georgia Senate runoffs and tomorrow’s vote on certifying the Electoral College from each state. Once back on Capitol Hill, I head to the House Chamber for our first and only vote series of the day then head back to my office where I have a virtual call with Americans for Fair Taxation to discuss the Fair Tax legislation I am the leading this session.  After our daily all-staff conference call, I head to a meeting of the Georgia congressional delegation and, later in the evening, I am honored to speak to students from the University of South Carolina School of Pharmacy in a virtual meeting.  My last event of the day is a live interview on Newsmax at 10:15 p.m. where I discuss the early returns of the Georgia Senate runoffs and tomorrows legislative agenda. A link to my interview can be found here.

Wednesday, January 6, 2021:  I’m up early this morning as I am live on Fox Business at 6:00 a.m. to discuss the Georgia Senate runoff results as well as the electoral certification today.  A link to my interview can be found here.  Later in the morning, I have a phone call with Dr. Lawton Davis, Health Director of the Coastal Health District of the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) to discuss the COVID-19 vaccine distribution in the First District.  After our daily all-staff conference call, I have an interview with WTOC-TV in Savannah to discuss results of the Georgia Senate runoffs. Afterwards, I join in on a conference call to discuss the SolarWinds Hack before heading down to the House Chamber for certification of the electoral votes from each state.  We have been warned to avoid being outside because of the protestors and as we begin our vote certification, we can hear the protestors outside.  After the Speaker gavels us in, she welcomes the Senators to this joint session and relinquishes the gavel to Vice President Mike Pence, the President of the Senate.  After accepting the electoral votes from Alabama and Alaska, a House member and Senator both object to accepting the electoral votes from Arizona.  As is in the rules, the Senate then goes back to their chambers to debate the issue and we stay in the House to debate.  During the debate, the protestors outside can be heard getting louder and louder.  After about 15 minutes of civil debate, the Capitol Hill police enter the House Chamber, lock us inside and inform us that the Capitol has been breached by the protestors.  Next, they escort the Speaker and other leaders from the House Chamber and then lead members out and through tunnels to an undisclosed location for our safety.  I am one of the last ones to leave the Chamber and I leave with mixed emotions.  I am very sad because of what I am witnessing, but I am also mad as hell at the protestors for what they are doing.  This type of behavior has no place in our society and those responsible should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.  We are carrying on a civil debate of a very important issue, which is our responsibility and our job.  The destruction and lawlessness displayed by these protestors hurts their own purported purpose and destroys what we are trying to achieve by having a civil debate.  Once we are in our secured location, all of us - Democrats, Republicans and Independents - are terribly upset by these developments.  After notifying family members of my safety, I have a number of phone interviews with district media to report on my experiences.  After being hunkered down in the undisclosed location for almost five hours, the Capitol is secured, and we head back to the House Chamber and continue with our work.  I am very proud that we did not let the protestors stop our work but instead we gaveled back in at 9:00 p.m. and worked until almost 4:00 a.m. the next morning having civil debate and finishing our work.  You can hear more about the experience, how I voted, and my thoughts on the 117th Congress in this week’s edition of Buddy’s Briefing.

Thursday, January 7, 2021:  After a little over 3 hours of sleep, I’m on the radio this morning with my good friend Bill Edwards with NewsTalk 1290 in Savannah to discuss the events of yesterday. Next, I film a video reflecting on Wednesday and explaining my votes. A link to that video can be found here. Next, I have a virtual interview with WTOC-TV in Savannah to discuss the events of yesterday, followed by our daily all-staff conference call.  Afterwards, I have a series of interviews to discuss yesterday’s events beginning with WCTV in Tallahassee, then WJCL-TV and WSAV-TV in Savannah.  A link to some of today’s interviews can be found here and here.

Next, I head outside of the Rayburn office building where I have an interview with WSB-TV in Atlanta.  A link to that interview can be found here.  Finally, I film this week’s edition of Buddy’s Briefing before ending what has been one of the saddest times of my life.  What I witnessed this week in our Nation’s Capitol was despicable, maddening and heartbreaking.  My hope is that those responsible for this will be arrested and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.  This type of behavior has no place in our society and I condemn it.

THE ATTACK ON OUR CAPITOL AND OUR DEMOCRACY
Dear friend, 
I could have never imagined the violence and lawlessness that I saw in the United States Capitol last Wednesday. Americans across the country watched in horror as a violent mob beat down the doors of the U.S. Capitol. Like many of you, this armed insurrection left me heartbroken and deeply disturbed.
Our current President threatens the very foundation of our democracy and the safety of our country. That is why I am calling on him to be removed from office immediately. 
I do not say this lightly, but his instigation of violence and failure to activate security forces to protect the Capitol or call on his supporters to stop their attack make him a threat to America for every hour that he remains in the Oval Office. For the good of the country, President Trump needs to be removed from office immediately through the 25th Amendment or impeachment.

Through all of this, my colleagues and I were committed to fulfilling our constitutional duty to certify the election of President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. We have a long way to go to heal our nation after this week, and I am committed to doing my part to end this national nightmare. 
As always, I am here to help you. If you need assistance at this difficult time, please do not hesitate to contact my Kirkland office at (425) 485-0085. For more updates on what I’m doing for WA-01, you can follow me on social media at the links above.
Stay safe and stay healthy,
Suzan

1/9/21 21:41,Protecting our Democracy,"
 

￼

Dear Lindsey,
 
This has been a dark week in our nation's history.
 
The violent storming of the United States Capitol by a lawless mob seeking to thwart the certification of the presidential election was an assault on our democracy.
 
The images of extremists desecrating the seat of our democracy - many proudly waving Confederate flags and anti-Semitic symbols - filled me with a deep level of anger and sadness.
 
Those who laid siege on the Capitol and committed these heinous crimes, including the tragic death of a Capitol Hill police officer, must be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law.
 
Let's be clear: this riot was incited by the President of the United States, who spent months fomenting distrust in our democratic process with his wild conspiracy theories and public efforts to overturn the will of the American people. 
 
By inciting this riot, President Trump violated his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the duties of the Presidency and has shown to be incapable of leading our country over the next 11 days. For the safety and security of our country, he must be immediately removed from office.
 
Despite the seditious acts that took place this week, and the undermining of our democracy by the President, the will of the voters was ultimately upheld. On January 20th, the peaceful transition of power will take place and President-elect Biden will be sworn in to lead our country.
 
As we reflect on the tumultuous events of this week, let us not forget that our democracy is precious, but worth protecting. We must move forward together with strength and resolve.
 
  
Be well,
￼
  
Ami Bera, M.D.

Dear Friend,

Martin Luther King, Jr., once said that “Peace is not merely a distant goal that we seek, but a means by which we arrive at that goal.” 

Over the past year, we have seen violent protests spread throughout our country, and over and over, those who committed violence were not held accountable. In fact, when the statue of Christopher Columbus was torn down this past summer in Baltimore, Speaker Nancy Pelosi shrugged it off as “people will do what they do.”

This lack of accountability undoubtedly contributed to the shameful display this week in the United States Capitol building...KEEP READING HERE

Rob’s Rundown: Week of January 4 – January 8, 2021  
Happy new year everyone. On Wednesday, Portman condemned the violent and criminal acts that took place at the U.S. Capitol saying that an attack on the Capitol building is an attack on every American. Likewise, an attack on our nation’s brave law enforcement officers is an attack on the rule of law and the safety and security of all Americans. He called on President Trump to embrace the peaceful transfer of power, and said the Senate should reconvene to get the work of the American people done. 
Once the Capitol was secured and the Senate reconvened on Wednesday evening, Portman delivered remarks on the Senate floor reiterating his condemnation of the attack on the Capitol and discussing his support for certifying the formal count of the Electoral College votes by Congress. As Portman stated on Monday, the Constitution was drafted by the Founders to ensure that the people and the states hold the power to choose the President, not Congress, and that voting to reject a state’s electors is an extreme remedy that runs counter to that intention. Ultimately, Portman reiterated that he could not support establishing a dangerous precedent where Congress can inappropriately assert itself to try to reverse the will of the voters. That is why he upheld his oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States by voting to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election. 
On Friday, Portman and Senator Gary Peters (D-MI), the leaders of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Senators Roy Blunt (R-MO) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), the leaders of the Senate Rules Committee, announced their intention to hold hearings and conduct joint bipartisan oversight of security failures after a criminal mob stormed the Capitol and interrupted the formal count of the Electoral College votes, attempting to subvert American Democracy. 
For a more detailed look at Senator Portman’s week, please see the following: 
Monday, January 4, 2021 
Portman Statement on the Formal Count of the Electoral College Votes by Congress 
Today, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) released the following statement on the upcoming formal count of the Electoral College votes by Congress: 
""The Constitution created a system for electing the President through the Electoral College that ensures the people and the states hold the power, not Congress. I cannot support allowing Congress to thwart the will of the voters. 
""I voted for President Trump, campaigned for him as one of his Ohio co-chairs, and believe his policies are better for Ohio and America. Like nearly half the country, I was disappointed in the election results. Following the election, I supported the Trump campaign’s right to pursue recounts and legal challenges. There were instances of fraud and irregularities, as there are in every presidential election, and those who engaged in that conduct should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. But after two months of recounts and legal challenges, not a single state recount changed a result and, of the dozens of lawsuits filed, not one found evidence of fraud or irregularities widespread enough to change the result of the election. This was the finding of numerous Republican-appointed judges and the Trump Administration’s own Department of Justice. Every state has now weighed in and certified its electoral slate based on its vote and the process set out in the Constitution.  
""I understand that despite these findings and the state certifications, many Americans believe the election was unfairly decided and, as I noted, there were instances of fraud and irregularities that occurred. For these reasons, for the past several weeks I have advocated that Congress should establish a blue ribbon bipartisan panel on election integrity that would provide transparency into issues in the 2020 election, and recommend best practices for the next election.  
""The process in Congress on January 6 is based on a federal law that allows Congress to consider objections to a state’s certification of its electors. If both a member of the House and a member of the Senate object to a state’s certification of electors, it requires a Congressional vote on whether to reject that state’s electors. This vote has only happened twice in the 133 years since Congress enacted this statute, and Congress has never voted to uphold a challenge. It is an extreme remedy because, counter to the Constitution, it allows Congress to substitute its judgment for the judgment of the voters, and for the judgment of the states that certified the results.  
""The only time this was attempted in the past 70 years was in 2005 when Democrats objected to the electors from my home state of Ohio, hoping to give the presidency to John Kerry instead of George W. Bush. I stood in opposition to Democrats then, saying Congress should not ‘obstruct the will of the American people.’ I was concerned then that Democrats were establishing a dangerous precedent where Congress would inappropriately assert itself to try to reverse the will of the voters. I cannot now support Republicans doing the same thing. Over the course of my public service career I have taken the same oath on numerous occasions, swearing to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. I plan on honoring that oath by supporting the state certifications and the will of the people. I will vote to certify in accordance with my duty under the Constitution.""  
Portman, Peters Bipartisan Bill to Fix Security Vulnerability Posed by Foreign Ownership of Federally Leased Properties Signed into Law 
A bipartisan bill authored by U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH) and Gary Peters (D-MI) that requires the federal government to determine if office space it leases is owned by foreign entities has been signed into law. Portman and Peters will lead the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in the 117th Congress.  
""I applaud President Trump for signing into law this important legislation to help ensure our federal agencies are prepared to address the risk of espionage and unauthorized cyber and physical access to federally leased buildings,” said Senator Portman. “This bill, now law, will ensure that the federal government has access to leased properties’ ownership information so we can better protect our people and information.""

Portman Names Pam Thiessen, Andy Dockham, Amanda Neely, Kirsten Madison & Emily Benavides to Senior Roles at Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee
Portman, who is expected to be the top Republican at the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), announced that his senior HSGAC leadership team will include Pam Thiessen as Staff Director, Andy Dockham as Chief Counsel and Deputy Staff Director, Amanda Neely as Director of Governmental Affairs and General Counsel to Senator Portman, Kirsten Madison as Director of Homeland Security, and Emily Benavides as Communications Director.
""Pam is a great friend and trusted confidant, and I look forward to her leading our team at HSGAC,” said Portman. “I’m grateful for her loyal service over the past decade. She has been instrumental in our biggest legislative victories, whether it was passing tax reform, addressing the addiction crisis, combating online sex trafficking, and much more. I look forward to her leadership as Staff Director at HSGAC in the next Congress.""  
""Andy has led a team at PSI that built an incredible record of accomplishment through hard-hitting bipartisan investigations,” said Portman.  “He is a highly respected investigative professional and his knowledge and years of experience at HSGAC will serve our team well. I’m pleased that he will serve as my Chief Counsel and Deputy Staff Director.""  
""Amanda has led thoughtful PSI investigations to hold federal agencies accountable over the past four years and her oversight expertise will be invaluable as she takes on the Director of Governmental Affairs role at HSGAC,” said Portman.  “I look forward to her leadership of the Governmental Affairs team at HSGAC and I’m pleased that she will continue to serve as my General Counsel.""  
""I am pleased that Kirsten is joining our team as the Director of Homeland Security,” said Portman. “Her excellent reputation and wealth of experience on Capitol Hill, as well as in the Executive Branch, will be a great asset to the HSGAC team."" 
""Emily Benavides is a talented communications professional and brings a wealth of experience and an unique perspective to this new role,” said Portman.  “An Ohio native of Mexican-American descent, Emily has been a critical member of my team for nearly five years. I’ve come to rely on her guidance and counsel, and I’m pleased she will serve as Communications Director at HSGAC.""  
Portman Announces Matt Lloyd Joining Team Portman as Deputy Chief of Staff and Communications Director 
Portman announced today that Matt Lloyd has joined his personal office as Deputy Chief of Staff and Communications Director.  In that role, Matt will oversee communications for the Portman operation.  The move comes as Portman is taking on additional responsibilities as either chairman or ranking member of the Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee.  As previously announced, Emily Benavides will serve as Portman’s Communications Director at the Committee. Portman issued the following statement: 
""Matt brings tremendous experience to our already strong team and I’m excited he is coming on board.  From his national security work at the Justice and State Departments, his work in House Republican leadership, and his years of service to Mike Pence when he served as Governor and in the House, Matt is a results-oriented pro who will make our team stronger.  We have a lot of work ahead of us in this new Congress.  I’m excited about our team as we focus on continuing to deliver results for Ohio and the country.""

Portman, Shaheen Applaud Signing of Bipartisan Legislation to Reauthorize Peace Corps Commemorative Project into Law
Senators Portman and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) applauded the president for signing their bipartisan legislation to reauthorize the Peace Corps Commemorative project into law. Representatives Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) and Garret Graves (R-LA) led the legislation in the House. In 2014, Senators Portman and Shaheens’s and Rep. Kennedy’s bipartisan Peace Corps Commemorative Act was signed into law to create a commemorative memorial in Washington, D.C.'s National Capital Area to celebrate the mission of the Peace Corps and the ideals on which the Peace Corps was founded. This bipartisan legislation designated the Peace Corps Commemorative Foundation as the lead nonfederal sponsor for the project, and prohibits the use of federal funding. The current authorization for the project is set to expire in January 2021. This legislation would extend the authorization for the project for an additional seven years, to January 2028, in order for the project to secure the necessary design approvals and raise the funding for construction.  
“For more than 50 years, the Peace Corps has served as a powerful vehicle for volunteers who wish to use their talents to carry America’s humanitarian values to other parts of the world,” said Portman.  ""By reauthorizing this project, we can ensure the Peace Corps Commemorative Foundation can finish this important project and honor those Americans who have donated their time and talent to serving others. I applaud President Trump for signing this important legislation into law."" 
Portman, Stabenow, Joyce, Kaptur Applaud Signing of Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act into Law 
Senators Portman and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), along with Representatives David Joyce (R-OH) and Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), applauded the signing of their bipartisan bill, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) Act, into law. The legislation reauthorizes the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which is set to expire at the end of FY 2021, for another five years. It also increases the current authorization level from $300 million to $375 million in FY 2022 and by $25 million annually until it reaches $475 million in FY 2026.  The FY 2021 Bipartisan Funding Agreement appropriated $330 million for the program for the next fiscal year.  Enactment of this legislation paves the way for higher funding levels in future years. 
""I applaud President Trump for signing the GLRI Act into law today. This is a victory for our efforts to protect our Great Lakes. GLRI is a successful public-private partnership that has helped address the greatest threats to the Great Lakes, including harmful algal blooms, invasive species, pollution, and contamination. Despite the program’s success, there is more work to be done,"" Senator Portman said. ""Lake Erie supports fishing and tourism industries totaling over $10 billion and is a top tourist destination in Ohio. With more than 10 million people depending on Lake Erie for their drinking water and hundreds of thousands of Ohioans depending upon the Lake for jobs, we must continue to protect our Great Lakes for the economic and environmental well-being of our region."" 
Portman, Brown, Ryan Applaud Signing of Bipartisan, Bicameral Legislation to Name Youngstown Veterans Affairs Clinic After Ohioan Carl Nunziato into Law 
Senators Portman and Sherrod Brown (D-OH), along with U.S. Representative Tim Ryan (D-OH) applauded the signing into law of their bipartisan and bicameral legislation to name a Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient clinic in Youngstown, Ohio after Major Carl Nunziato, a veteran of the U.S. Army.    
Major Nunziato served two voluntary tours of combat duty in Vietnam, where he was severely injured by a mortar shell while protecting the village of Soui Da, resulting in the amputation of both his legs. For his bravery, he received the Bronze Star, the Army Air Medal, a Purple Heart, and the Vietnam Campaign Medal. Throughout his admirable life, Carl Nunziato has served Youngstown and the United States, both at home and abroad, with bravery and honor. He has worked valiantly to improve accessibility, rights, and quality of life for veterans and people with disabilities, and the naming of the Youngstown Veterans Affairs Clinic after Mr. Nunziato would be a fitting tribute to his outstanding work and service.   
""Carl Nunziato is a true son of Ohio and an American patriot who deserves this honor,” said Portman. “I’m proud that President Trump signed this important legislation into law to name the Veterans Affairs clinic in Youngstown, Ohio after Major Nunziato. He has fought and sacrificed for our nation, for his fellow veterans, and for all disabled Americans and this legislation is a fitting tribute to his valuable achievements. I’m grateful for his service and proud to call him a fellow Ohioan.”   
Portman Statement on the Attack on the U.S. Capitol 
Portman issued the following statement today on the attack on the U.S. Capitol: 
""I condemn the violent and criminal acts that took place at the U.S. Capitol today.  These shameful actions to disrupt a session of Congress and vandalize the Capitol building should never happen in our great republic. The U.S. Capitol belongs to every American and is a symbol of the citadel of democracy. An attack on the Capitol building is an attack on every American. Likewise, an attack on our nation’s brave law enforcement officers is an attack on the rule of law and the safety and security of all Americans.  
""It is time for President Trump to embrace the peaceful transfer of power, which is mandated under the Constitution and a hallmark of our democracy.  The Senate should reconvene in our Chamber to get our work done. I urge the House and Senate to certify the electoral college results tonight."" 
On Senate Floor, Portman Condemns Attack on U.S. Capitol and His Support for Certifying Electoral College Results 
On the Senate floor, Portman condemned the attack on the U.S. Capitol by a criminal mob. In addition, he discussed his support for certifying the formal count of the Electoral College votes by Congress. As he has stated previously, he noted that the Constitution was drafted by the Founders to ensure that the people and the states hold the power to choose the President, not Congress, and that voting to reject a state’s electors is an extreme remedy that runs counter to that intention. Portman, who supported President Trump’s re-election, understands that many Americans believe the election was unfairly decided despite two months of recounts and legal challenges that found no evidence of fraud or irregularities widespread enough to change the result of the election. That is why he plans to introduce legislation to establish an independent, bipartisan, blue ribbon panel on election integrity that would provide transparency into issues in the 2020 election, and recommend best practices for the states moving forward. 
Ultimately, Portman reiterated that he cannot support establishing a dangerous precedent where Congress can inappropriately assert itself to try to reverse the will of the voters. That is why he is upholding his oath to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States by voting to certify the results of 2020 presidential election.

Portman Announces $2.7 Million FEMA Grant to Franklin County to Provide COVID-19 Protective Measures 
Portman applauded the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for awarding a $2.7 million grant to help Franklin County with costs associated with continuing to provide COVID-19 emergency protective measures. FEMA awarded this grant from replenished funds accessible thanks to the bipartisan CARES Act, which Senator Portman supported and was signed into law by President Trump.  
""The $2.7 million FEMA grant is good news for Franklin County because it will help them continue to provide the protective measures that Central Ohioans desperately need during this ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” said Portman. “This pandemic has created significant and unprecedented challenges across Ohio and these funds will provide much-needed additional support. I will continue to work with my bipartisan colleagues in Congress to ensure that Ohio has the necessary resources during these uncertain times.""   
Portman: $2.2 Million Federal Grant for Ohio University Will Boost Economic Development Efforts Across Southeast Ohio 
Portman praised the $2.2 million federal grant awarded by the U.S. Commerce Department’s Economic Development Administration (EDA) to Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. The federal grant will boost economic development efforts in Southeast Ohio by providing technical assistance to accelerate the economic transition to new industries in 18 Appalachian Ohio counties. The EDA grant will be matched with $550,000 in local funds. 
The funding announced today will catalyze private investment in nearby Opportunity Zones. As part of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Portman fought for to include Opportunity Zones in the final tax reform package. This tax incentive is designed to encourage investment and job creation in low-income communities.  
""This $2.2 million federal grant to Ohio University is great news for our economic development efforts in Southeast Ohio and our workers and families in the region,” said Portman. ""Opportunity Zones boost investments and jobs in struggling communities throughout Ohio which is exactly what Congress intended to accomplish when we created this incentive in the 2017 tax reform law. I want to thank Secretary Ross for this investment to allow Ohio University to help the Southeast Ohio region make the economic transition to new industries and ensure continued job creation as well as economic growth.""

Bipartisan Senate Homeland Security and Rules Committee Leaders Announce Joint Oversight After Attack on the Capitol Building
Senators Rob Portman and Gary Peters (D-MI), leaders of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, and Roy Blunt (R-MO) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), leaders of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration, released the following statement announcing their intention to hold hearings and conduct joint oversight of security failures after a criminal mob stormed the Capitol and interrupted the formal count of the Electoral College votes, attempting to subvert American Democracy: 
""Wednesday’s violent and criminal acts directed at our Capitol, a symbol of American Democracy, will forever be a stain on our nation’s history. Due to the heroic acts of many, the perpetrators of this attack failed to achieve their goal. It is our duty as bipartisan leaders of the Senate committees with jurisdiction over homeland security, oversight and Capitol operations to examine the security failures that led to Wednesday’s attack.  
""Let us be clear: An attack on the Capitol Building is an attack on every American. We plan to conduct oversight and hold bipartisan hearings on these horrific events, and work together to make the necessary reforms to ensure this never happens again.""

Ohio’s Sen. Rob Portman won’t support electoral vote challenges in Congress 
Ohio Republican Sen. Rob Portman announced Monday that he won’t side with Republicans who hope to challenge the electoral vote counts in several states on Jan. 6 in hopes of swaying the results of the 2020 presidential election to incumbent Republican Donald Trump.
""The Constitution created a system for electing the President through the Electoral College that ensures the people and the states hold the power, not Congress,” said a statement that Portman released on Monday. “I cannot support allowing Congress to thwart the will of the voters.""
Portman issued his statement as several Republicans in the U.S. Senate announced that they’ll back efforts to challenge the presidential election results when when Congress meets on Jan. 6 to count and certify Electoral College votes.
Democratic President-elect Joe Biden clinched the election with 306 electoral votes to 232 for Trump, but Trump has insisted that the results were tainted by fraud in several states that backed Biden. He has not provided evidence to back his claims, and courts have tossed out dozens of Trump-backed lawsuits aiming to overturn the election results. Despite the lack of legal success, a faction of Republicans loyal to Trump whose members include Champaign County Republican Rep. Jim Jordan and Holmes County Republican Rep. Bob Gibbs plan to challenge the electoral vote count of the states Trump disputes. After that happens, the Senate and House will meet individually to weigh the arguments.
In a statement released Monday, Gibbs said he doesn’t believe the fraud allegations got their day in court since many of the cases were dismissed on procedural grounds. He said he will object to the certification of the Electoral College for some states on Wednesday so Congress can provide a venue for the American people to hear evidence that wasn’t presented in court, and to “ensure the validity of our elections.""
""The Constitution gives state legislatures the authority and power to set elections, and I believe state judiciaries and state executive offices overstepped their authority in a handful of states,” said Gibbs. “Based on my reading of federal code, Congress has the authority to deem whether electors were appointed in accordance with state election law.""
GOP Rep. Anthony Gonzalez of Rocky River released a constituent letter on Thursday that cited reasoning similar to Portman’s for declining to contest the election results. 
""There is simply no legal basis for Congress to throw out the the certified electoral vote and overturn the results of this election,” Gonzalez wrote 
Because a majority in both the Republican-controlled U.S. Senate and the Democrat-controlled U.S. House of Representatives would have to reject any state’s results, the anticipated debate is unlikely to keep Biden from assuming the presidency, though it could have political fallout for elected officeholders like Portman.
Portman’s statement said he voted for Trump, campaigned for him, supports his policies, and was disappointed by the results of November’s election. 
""Following the election, I supported the Trump campaign’s right to pursue recounts and legal challenges,” Portman’s statement said. “There were instances of fraud and irregularities, as there are in every presidential election, and those who engaged in that conduct should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. But after two months of recounts and legal challenges, not a single state recount changed a result and, of the dozens of lawsuits filed, not one found evidence of fraud or irregularities widespread enough to change the result of the election. This was the finding of numerous Republican-appointed judges and the Trump Administration’s own Department of Justice. Every state has now weighed in and certified its electoral slate based on its vote and the process set out in the Constitution.""
Portman said that because there were some cases of election irregularities and he understands many Americans believe the election was unfairly decided, he has urged Congress to create a “blue ribbon bipartisan panel on election integrity that would provide transparency into issues in the 2020 election, and recommend best practices for the next election.""
He noted the objections to be lodged on Jan. 6 have happened only twice since Congress enacted the statute that enabled them, and the challenges were never upheld. He called it an “extreme remedy” that would allow “Congress to substitute its judgment for the judgment of voters, and for the judgment of states that certified the results.""
The statement observes that when Portman was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2005, he opposed an effort by Cleveland Democratic Rep. Stephanie Tubbs Jones to challenge Ohio’s electoral vote count to draw attention to voting problems in the state such as hours-long lines at the polls. Unlike the efforts on Trump’s behalf, the Tubbs Jones protest did not aim to overturn the results of the 2004 election, and was not endorsed by the losing candidate: Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry.
""I stood in opposition to Democrats then, saying Congress should not ‘obstruct the will of the American people,'” Portman’s statement said. “I was concerned then that Democrats were establishing a dangerous precedent where Congress would inappropriately assert itself to try to reverse the will of the voters. I cannot now support Republicans doing the same thing.""
Even though Portman was re-elected in 2016 with a more than 20% edge over that year’s Democratic candidate, former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, he has been loath to alienate voters in the state who support Trump, who won the state’s voters by an 8% margin each year he was on the ballot, observes Baldwin Wallace University political scientist Thomas Sutton.
Portman is up for re-election in 2022, and Sutton believes he’d prefer to avoid a primary challenge from a Republican such as Jordan who might argue Portman was insufficiently loyal to Trump. Shortly after GOP Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine referred to Biden as “President-elect” in a November CNN interview, Trump posted a message on Twitter that asked: “Who will be running for Governor of the Great State of Ohio? Will be hotly contested!” The comment was widely interpreted as an invitation for a DeWine primary challenge. Portman waited until December to call Biden “President-elect.""
Sutton said that Trump has “deep, broad, enthusiastic support among core Republican constituencies” in nearly all of Ohio’s 88 counties, and can have an effect on the state’s 2022 election if he remains politically active. Because Ohio voters have trended Republican in statewide elections in recent years, Sutton believes a primary challenge has greater potential to thwart Portman’s re-election than any Democrat. Sutton says Portman has low name recognition for an incumbent U.S. Senator, and is more of a policy expert than a “popular presence.""
A Trump loyalist like Jordan could mount a challenge if he doesn’t decide to remain in the U.S. House of Representatives to assume a party leadership role if Republicans win control of the legislative body in 2022, says Sutton.
""Trump is clearly a charismatic, dynamic presence on the political scene,” said Sutton. “People either really love him or really don’t.""

Portman calls for hearings, joint oversight of security failures during Capitol breach 
U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH), alongside other Senate leaders, announced his intention to hold hearings and conduct joint oversight of the security failures that went on during Wednesday’s breach of the U.S. Capitol. 
Portman was joined by Gary Peters (D-MI), with whom he leads the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, as well as Roy Blunt (R-MO) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who together lead the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration. 
The Senators’ announcement comes two days after a mob of President Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, leading to the death of five people, including a Capitol police officer. 
The Senators released the following statement Friday, in response the violent interruption of the formal count of the electoral vote:
""Wednesday’s violent and criminal acts directed at our Capitol, a symbol of American Democracy, will forever be a stain on our nation’s history. Due to the heroic acts of many, the perpetrators of this attack failed to achieve their goal. It is our duty as bipartisan leaders of the Senate committees with jurisdiction over homeland security, oversight and Capitol operations to examine the security failures that led to Wednesday’s attack.
""Let us be clear: An attack on the Capitol Building is an attack on every American. We plan to conduct oversight and hold bipartisan hearings on these horrific events, and work together to make the necessary reforms to ensure this never happens again."" 
A number of lawmakers have called for Trump’s removal from office following Wednesday’s events, including Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH). 
Portman called on Trump to condemn the actions taken by his supporters that day, but has so far not supported the president’s removal.

Dear Friend,
I hope that you and your family are keeping safe and staying healthy during this difficult time.
In the aftermath of the horrible violence at the Capitol this week, I wanted to let you know that my staff and I are safe, and we continue our work on behalf of the people of the 11th Congressional District. 
 
The failed insurrection briefly delayed our proceedings, but after law enforcement secured the Capitol, we quickly returned to complete our Constitutional duty of certifying the Electoral College vote and affirming Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the next President and Vice President of the United States. President-elect Biden will be sworn in at noon on January 20th, and we will finally turn the page on this dangerous, corrupt administration.
 
The responsibility for the disgraceful scenes we witnessed at the Capitol lies at the feet of President Trump, who has spent the last two months fomenting anger and delusion about the results of the election. Also responsible are politicians who have been undermining our democratic system of government by embracing disinformation and conspiracy theories.
 
Let me be clear: this attempted insurrection failed and did not prevent the Congress from carrying out the people's business. January 6th will live in infamy in our nation's history as a day we saw the very worst of America, but we also saw something else - the unwavering resilience of our democracy.
 
President Trump's actions since the election have only made the case for removing him from office stronger. He is dangerously unfit to be President. The Vice President should immediately invoke the 25th Amendment and work with the Cabinet to remove Trump from power. At the same time, Congress should reconvene and move to impeach and remove him from office. I voted to impeach the President before, and I will do so again. 
 
Regardless of the outcome of these efforts, the United States will have a new President in no more than 11 days. While the next two weeks may be chaotic, one thing is clear: our democracy will survive Donald Trump and the toxicity that will define his legacy.
Remember, I am here to work for you. If you have any questions, or concerns please feel free to e-mail me, call our office, or connect with me on Facebook and Twitter.
Sincerely,
￼
Bill Foster
Member of Congress

January 9, 2021 


Early Thursday morning, our democracy prevailed. Despite President Trump’s calls for insurrection, his contempt for the Constitution, and his lawless conduct, the will of the American people held firm. The historic victory of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris has been certified by the United States Congress and they will both be sworn in as President and Vice President on January 20th. 
But this resounding testament to the durability of our institutions was interrupted earlier on Wednesday by a violent and seditious attack on our republic. I never thought I would witness this type of assault on our Capitol and our democracy – both from without and within. The President ignited this fire and the complicity of far too many Republican members of Congress fueled the flames. Following the attacks, I spoke on the Senate floor about Republican lawmakers’ irresponsible and unfounded attempts to challenge November’s election results, and the damaging consequences of their actions. 
President Trump instigated this attack and must be removed from office. Each day he remains in the White House is a threat to our country. While only a few days still remain in his term, Trump is a ticking time bomb aimed at the heart of our democracy. Washington’s leaders have a moral responsibility to intervene before the fuse blows. I have already urged Vice President Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment. Should he and the Cabinet fail to act, I believe that Congress must move forward with articles of impeachment. 
This has been a dark week for our democracy, but there is still cause for hope. On Tuesday, the people of Georgia raised their voices and sent two new leaders to Washington, D.C. – Rev. Raphael Warnock, the senior pastor at the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church where Dr. King once held the pulpit, and Jon Ossoff. Their victories have given the Democrats a razor-thin majority in the Senate and, importantly, taken the gavel out of the hands of Senator McConnell. We will move with urgency to defeat the raging COVID-19 pandemic, deliver more emergency relief to struggling Marylanders, build an economy that works for all, tackle the deeply-rooted problems of racial and social inequality, and work to mend the torn fabric of our democracy. 
In his second inaugural address, Abraham Lincoln issued a now famous call to “bind up the nation’s wounds.” Despite the wake of blood, betrayal, and violence left by the Civil War, Lincoln determined that the only way forward was in peace and unity. In only a few days, we will inaugurate a new President and Vice President who will be tasked with helping a divided country come together again. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have promised to serve both those who voted for them and those who didn’t. I know that they will uphold this pledge. It remains to be seen whether a substantial number of Senate Republicans will accept their hand of unity. I do know that, with your input and help, I will fight every day to help heal a broken nation, meet the urgent challenges before us, and set us on a brighter course.

1/9/21 12:05,Rep. Grothman Newsletter- Chaos in Washington,"￼

 
This Week's Events in Washignton
 
Wednesday was a big day for news out of the U.S. Capitol. The riots that took place around the building were chaotic and, as I am sure they were broadcast around the world, it was embarrassing for our country. I condemn the rioters as well as any public officials who played a role in encouraging this behavior. In particular, Rudy Giuliani and the President’s son, Donald Trump Jr., behaved irresponsibly.
 
I sincerely hope that as many of these lawbreakers as possible are apprehended, charged and the public is informed of their backgrounds. I would like to thank the Capitol Police and the National Guard, who entirely restored order to the situation by 9 p.m. that night.
 
I would also like to comment on the vote that took place later that night and into the morning to certify the Electoral College votes as forwarded by the states. The U.S. Constitution is very clear that the states determine their own electors. In Wisconsin, for example, the elections commission and state Supreme Court determined that Joe Biden won the election, and federal courts did not overturn this result.
 
Some Congressmen this week wanted to overturn the results in two states, Arizona and Pennsylvania, by voting to not certify the electoral votes in Congress. I am sure that James Madison and Alexander Hamilton are spinning in their graves. The idea that the President would be determined by a vote of Congress is both absurd and dangerous. I ask my Republican friends how they would feel if in 2024 Mike Pompeo were to best Kamala Harris with 275 electoral votes and a Democratic Congress were to throw out Wisconsin’s electoral votes because we have photo I.D. laws or didn’t have enough voting machines? We would be apoplectic. But on Wednesday, over 100 Republican Congressmen and six Senators were prepared to set that precedent. Some Congressmen voted ‘no’ to ‘make a statement’. I almost did this myself so I don’t want to be too critical, but a vote is a vote and it would go into the history books as one more Congressman approving of the idea that Congress elects the President.
 
After the 2016 election, a smaller number of Democratic Members of Congress tried to break with the Constitution when Donald Trump was elected President. Seven Democratic Congressmen made objections on the House floor to take the election away from Trump. Congressmen Jim McGovern (D-MA) and Maxine Waters (D-CA) did so because of the debunked theory that the Russians won the election for Donald Trump. Most of the seven are prone to extremism and I was glad their effort went nowhere. At the time I was appalled that even seven Democrats would think that the Constitution gave them the right to overturn the electoral college and President Trump’s victory. Nevertheless, some of my colleagues cite these seven as a precedent to turn elections over to Congress.
 
Normally it’s the Democrats who trash our founding fathers and the electoral college and the protections it provides. Now, Republicans want to ignore it!
 
People raise allegations of voter fraud or unfair behavior. Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell repeatedly promised bombshells that would prove crookedness. It never appeared, which undermined the President’s case. I will also point out that privately, Congressmen from Georgia, Arizona, and Pennsylvania have said that Joe Biden won their states, but they are hesitant to say so publicly.
 
I do, however, believe we need a commission to investigate election fraud as advocated by Senator Johnson. The overwhelming number of President Trump’s supporters who believe the election was stolen shows the need for the public to receive answers to these allegations.
  
 
Officer Sicknick
 
During Wednesday's insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick defended the building but was, unfortunately, injured and later died. Please take a moment to pray for officer Sicknick's family, the Capitol Police force, and everyone who was injured or killed because of the riot on Wednesday.
  
 
Fixing Elections in Wisconsin
 
Leading up to Wednesday's vote to certify the 2020 election results, I joined my Republican colleagues in the Wisconsin delegation in writing an article that outlines six ways we can improve the election system in Wisconsin right now.

Weekly Roundup
 
Usually, I use the weekly roundup to share some of the places I visited, meetings I had and comments I've made during the week. This week, I would like to share with you two floor speeches made by my colleagues.
 
The first was made by Congressman Chip Roy (R-TX), where he explains the scope of the Constitution and the founding fathers’ intent for Congress to leave the Presidential election to the people and states.

The second was made by Senator Rand Paul (R-KY). As Republicans, we believe in the American experiment, states’ rights and that Congress is not a forum to overturn the election results of the states. That responsibility lies with the citizens of the state and it’s local officials.

A DARK DAY FOR OUR COUNTRY
Wednesday was a dark day for our country. I 100 percent support peaceful protest but this was not it. What happened at the Capitol is unacceptable and every perpetrator must be punished to the fullest extent of the law. 
￼
I joined Good Morning America the morning after the riots to talk about what I saw. Click here to watch. 
￼
I also shared my experience at the Capitol with Neil Cavuto on Fox Business. Click here to watch the full interview.
 While we saw the worst in some, we also saw the best in others. I am grateful for the law enforcement officers, especially those with the U.S. Capitol Police and Sergeant at Arms, who put their lives on the line to keep people safe.
 
THE FUTURE OF OUR ELECTION SYSTEM IS AT STAKE
￼
I shared why I supported contesting the electoral votes from several states with C-SPAN. Click here to watch.
 On Wednesday, January 6th, a joint session of Congress convened to count the electoral college votes and I contested the votes from several states.
 
The reason I contested the results was not a political decision. It is because I firmly believe the procedures surrounding how the electors in several states were chosen violates our Constitution.
 
Under the Constitution, states have the right to set their own election laws and state legislatures are the only ones who have the authority to direct how the presidential electors are chosen. In several states, the rules were deliberately changed by officials other than the state legislatures in direct violation of the U.S. Constitution and the constitutions of those states.
 
I swore an oath to protect and defend the Constitution therefore I could not in good conscience vote to certify an election where the electors were not chosen properly. Standing by and letting those electoral votes be certified would have shown the American people the foundation of our democracy means nothing.
 
The future of our election system is at stake. Our country is and always will be worth fighting for.
 
THANK YOU, LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS
Today is National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day and I want to take the opportunity to say thank you to the many law enforcement officers across the Second District. We are forever grateful for your service and the sacrifices you make for your communities.
 
WHERE ARE YOU IN DISTRICT 2?
￼
 
Communities all across the Second Congressional District of Oklahoma are full of things that make them unique and I want to highlight some of them. Every week on my Facebook page, I will post an up-close photo of a landmark somewhere in the district with a clue to where it is. I encourage everyone to put their best guess in the comments. The correct answer will be right here, in my weekly e-newsletter. 
￼
This week's landmark took us to the southern part of the district to a town named after a general and it honors our service members who served from 1917-1918. It’s the World War I memorial in Fort Towson!
 
Stay in touch by visiting my Facebook and Twitter  pages and as always, don’t hesitate to contact me if I can help in any way. 

Thank you, ￼

1/9/21 10:01,Covid-19 Vaccine: YOU HAVE A SPOT. TAKE YOUR SHOT.,"￼

 
COVID-19 Vaccine: 
 
 
YOU HAVE A SPOT. TAKE YOUR SHOT.
 
 
Dear Friends,
 
North Carolina’s multi-phase distribution plan for the COVID-19 vaccine is already underway. The vaccines are tested, safe and effective. In fact, I’ve already taken my shots and I feel fine.
 
Although in limited supply currently, ultimately every citizen will have an opportunity to get a vaccine, save lives and slow the spread of COVID-19. Getting vaccinated is our best shot at stopping COVID-19. YOU HAVE A SPOT. TAKE YOUR SHOT.
 
 
Who is being vaccinated now?
We are currently in Phase 1, which means we are vaccinating:

	•	Long-term care staff and residents: People living or working in places like skilled nursing facilities or group homes
	•	North Carolinians age 75+: Limited supplies mean those age 75 and over may have to wait, but they have one of the first spots to take their shot
 
Where are they being vaccinated?
	•	Health care workers at highest risk for COVID-19 exposure: In hospitals or local health departments that have received early shipments of the vaccine
	•	Long-term care staff and residents: The federal government manages vaccinations for most long-term care facilities. Most will be vaccinated at their facilities under the Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program with CVS and Walgreens
	•	North Carolinians Age 75+: Call the North Carolina COVID-19 line at 1-877-490-6642, visit YourSpotYourShot.nc.gov, or contact your local health department or hospital  to make an appointment
 
Below are the Phases of COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution:
 
Phase 1a: 
Health care workers fighting COVID-19 & Long-Term Care staff and residents.
 
Phase 1b: 
Adults 75 years or older and frontline essential workers.
	•	GROUP 1: Anyone aged 75+, regardless of health status
	•	GROUP 2: Health care workers and frontline essential workers aged 50+
	•	GROUP 3: Health care workers and frontline essential workers of any age
Phase 2: 
Adults at high risk for exposure and at increased risk of severe illness.
	•	GROUP 1: Anyone 65-74 years old, regardless of health status
	•	GROUP 2: Anyone 16-64 years old with high-risk medical conditions that increase risk of severe disease from COVID-19, such as cancer, COPD, serious heart conditions, sickle cell disease, Type 2 diabetes, etc.
	•	GROUP 3: Anyone who is incarcerated or living in close group living settings
	•	GROUP 4: Essential workers not yet vaccinated

1/9/21 9:34,An assault on American democracy,"￼

  
Dear Neighbor,
 
Like you, I am outraged and devastated by this week’s unprecedented assault on American democracy at the US Capitol. And I am overwhelmed with gratitude for the hundreds of messages of concern and support you delivered to me and my staff. We are safe. And we are more determined than ever to do our work on your behalf, and on behalf of every American who believes in the fundamental rightness of democracy.
 
On Wednesday, I arrived at the Capitol for the counting of the Electoral College votes. I was on the House floor when the building was breached and the House Chamber was placed into lockdown. Speaker Pelosi and other members of leadership were rushed off the floor by their security details, while the Sergeant at Arms locked the chamber doors and instructed members of Congress to don the gas masks kept under our seats in case of a chemical attack. With weapons drawn, Capitol Police used furniture to barricade the doors. 
 
We were evacuated from the Chamber as the mob smashed through the windows and attempted to break down the doors at the main entrance to the floor -- the same doors presidents are ushered through to deliver State of the Union addresses. As we left for a secure location through the Republican side of the Speaker's Lobby, I turned to my left and saw another makeshift barricade had been erected by the entrance to our side of the Lobby. I looked up and through smashed glass saw a second faction of the mob attempting to force their way onto the floor from the front of the Chamber. Tragically, a rioter pushing her way through that same broken window was shot and killed several moments later.
 
I will not mince words about this nightmare. The siege of the US Capitol was an act of violent insurrection against a coequal branch of the federal government, incited by the words and actions of a president desperate for power and incapable of coping with perceived humiliation or defeat. 
 
With our own eyes, we saw Donald Trump whip a crowd of his supporters into a frenzy outside the White House and urge them to march to the Capitol. With our own ears, we heard Rudy Giuliani, the president’s lawyer, tell them to engage in a ""trial by combat"" to overturn the election results. The mob was given orders, and the world watched on live TV as they carried them out.
 
So there’s no question that Donald J. Trump lit this flame. But don’t forget that it was Republicans in Congress who handed him the match. 
 
House and Senate Republicans have spent months lying to their supporters, pushing the outlandish claim that this election was rigged and stolen from the president. That was and is a lie.
 
They have spent months pushing the outlandish claim that Congress and the Vice President could somehow overturn the legitimate will of the people. That was and is a lie.
  
Over the coming days, there will be an intense effort among White House staff and Congressional Republicans to erase the president’s fingerprints from this attempted coup. That effort is an insult to the intelligence of the American people, and it will fail. We know where the responsibility lies. 
 
To that end, it is inescapably clear that we cannot endure another second of Donald Trump’s presidency, let alone another two weeks. Congress has the tools at its disposal to remove the president from office, and we must now use them. I am unequivocally prepared to impeach President Trump – again. The United States Congress does not negotiate with domestic terrorists and their enablers. 
 
For the sake of our democracy, and for the safety of our people, Donald Trump must go. Now.
 
Please continue to take care of yourselves and each other, and remember that my office is here to help. Be sure to visit the COVID-19 page on my website for more information and resources. If you have any questions or concerns, or if you need assistance, please don't hesitate to call us at (703) 256-3071.
 
Sincerely,

1/9/21 9:30,The Right Way and the Wrong Way,"
￼

Congressman Smith's E-news: January 09, 2021  
￼

On Wednesday, I spoke with NTV about the events at the Capitol. Click here to watch the interview in full. 

The Right Way and the Wrong Way

The actions of violent protesters at the heart of our republic this week were appalling and despicable. I continue to condemn these actions in the strongest possible terms. Our republic remains strong because of our shared commitment to settling our disagreements democratically, at the ballot box and through the deliberations of Congress. It was a testament to the dedication we have to our republic when we continued with the business of Congress that same day. 

On Wednesday, January 6, we met in a Joint Session of Congress to review and certify electoral votes from the states. At this joint session, states’ electoral votes are counted in alphabetical order. In order to debate whether to accept a state’s electoral votes, an objection must be presented in writing, signed by at least one Representative and one Senator. The process allows members of the House and Senate to raise their concerns.

While the procedures we followed were initially enacted by the Electoral Count Act of 1887 to settle disputes when factions within states submitted competing slates of electors, in modern Presidential elections the process has been used to highlight concerns about the elections conducted in various states. In 2005, Democrats debated the electoral votes from Ohio, and in 2017, House Democrats raised objections to electoral votes for President Trump from eleven different states. While objecting to the election of President Bush, Speaker Pelosi said, “we are witnessing democracy at work.” She continued, saying, “this debate is fundamental to our democracy.”

Just as Democrats expressed their concerns about Presidential elections in previous years, I signed onto objections to several states’ electoral votes. Changes to voting and vote-counting procedures in these states in question did not adhere to the standard established by the U.S. Supreme Court that any changes to election processes must be adopted by state legislatures. For example, in Pennsylvania state courts decided to remove signature matching requirements for mail-in ballots, extend the deadline for mailed ballots to be received, and presume ballots received late with unclear postmarks were mailed on time. 

Nebraska adapted their procedures to the current environment while remaining within the letter of the law, and Nebraskans deserve to know other states did the same. Even before Wednesday’s joint session, many supporters of President-Elect Biden, including at news outlets like CNN and MSNBC, were calling the effort to discuss our concerns about electoral votes anti-democratic. This type of rhetoric is meant to divert attention from the actual issues involving questionable election practices. Challenging electoral votes through a longstanding, legal process is well rooted in law and the debate precedents of the house. 

I support the prosecution of all who broke the law by desecrating our nation’s Capitol and disrupting the functioning of our government, and am pleased law enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, continue working to identify and bring these people to justice. It is Congress’ duty to continue the work of our government.

As you likely know, our joint session concluded with Vice President Pence declaring Joseph R. Biden President-Elect and Kamala D. Harris Vice President-Elect. To ensure our concerns were raised the right way, Members of Congress used their opportunity to address their objections though a legally prescribed process. In the future, I have faith that we will settle our disputes – no matter the issue – peacefully as our Founders intended.

McConnell Remarks on the Electoral College Count  Wednesday afternoon, January 6, 2021   WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) delivered the following remarks today regarding the Electoral College challenge:   ""We are debating a step that has never been taken in American history: Whether Congress should overrule voters and overturn a presidential election.  ""I have served 36 years in the Senate. This will be the most important vote I have ever cast. 
*** 
""President Trump claims this election was stolen. The assertions range from specific local allegations to constitutional arguments to sweeping conspiracy theories.  ""I supported the President’s right to use the legal system.  ""Dozens of lawsuits received hearings in courtrooms across the country.  ""But over and over, the courts rejected these claims — including all-star judges whom the President himself nominated.  ""Every election features some illegality and irregularity and it’s unacceptable.  ""I support strong state-led voting reforms. Last year’s bizarre pandemic procedures must not become the new norm.  ""But nothing before us proves illegality anywhere near the massive scale that would have tipped this entire election.  ""Nor can public doubt alone justify a radical break when that doubt was incited without evidence.  ""The Constitution gives Congress a limited role. We cannot simply declare ourselves a national Board of Elections on steroids. 
*** 
""The voters, the courts, and the states have all spoken.  ""If we overrule them all, it would damage our republic forever.  ""This election was not unusually close. Just in recent history, 1976, 2000, and 2004 were all closer.  ""This Electoral College margin is almost identical to 2016.  ""If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral.  ""We’d never see the whole nation accept an election again.  ""Every four years would bring a scramble for power at any cost.  ""The Electoral College would soon cease to exist, leaving the citizens of entire states with no real say in choosing presidents.  ""The effects would go even beyond elections themselves.  ""Self-government requires a shared commitment to truth and shared respect for the ground rules of our system.  ""We cannot keep drifting apart into two separate tribes; with separate facts, and separate realities; with nothing in common except hostility toward each another and mistrust for the few national institutions that we still share.  ""Every time in the last 30 years that Democrats have lost a presidential race, they’ve tried a challenge like this one — after 2000, 2004, and 2016.  ""After 2004, a Senator joined and forced this same debate. Democrats like Harry Reid, Dick Durbin, and Hillary Clinton praised and applauded the stunt.  ""Republicans condemned those baseless efforts. And we just spent four years condemning Democrats’ shameful attacks on the validity of President Trump’s own election.  ""There can be no double standard. The media that is outraged today spent four years aiding and abetting Democrats’ attacks on institutions after they lost.  ""But we must not imitate and escalate what we repudiate.  ""Our duty is to govern for the public good.  ""The United States Senate has a higher calling than an endless spiral of partisan vengeance. 
*** 
""Congress will either overrule the voters, the states, and the courts for the first time ever… or honor the people’s decision.  ""We will either guarantee Democrats’ delegitimizing efforts after 2016 become a permanent new routine for both sides... or declare that our nation deserves better.  ""We will either hasten down a poisonous path where only the winners of elections accept them... or show we can still muster the patriotic courage that our forebears showed, both in victory and in defeat.  ""The framers built the Senate to stop short-term passions from boiling over and melting the foundations of our Republic.  ""I believe protecting our constitutional order requires respecting limits on our own power.  ""It would be unfair and wrong to disenfranchise American voters and overrule the courts and the states on this thin basis.  ""And I will not pretend such a vote would be a harmless protest gesture while relying on others to do the right thing.  ""I will vote to respect the people’s decision and defend our system of government as we know it."" 
### 
""We Will Discharge Our Duty Under the Constitution for Our Nation""  Wednesday evening, January 6, 2021   WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) delivered the following remarks today regarding the Electoral College certification:   ""The United States Senate will not be intimidated.  ""We will not be kept out of this chamber by thugs, mobs, or threats. We will not bow to lawlessness or intimidation.  ""We are back at our posts. We will discharge our duty under the Constitution for our nation.  ""And we are going to do it tonight.  ""This afternoon, Congress began the process of honoring the will of the American people and counting the Electoral College votes.  ""We have fulfilled this solemn duty every four years for more than two centuries.  ""Whether our nation has been at war or at peace, under all manner of threats, even during an ongoing armed rebellion and Civil War, the clockwork of our democracy has carried on.  ""The United States and the United States Congress have faced down much greater threats than the unhinged crowd we saw today. We have never been deterred before and we will not be deterred today.  ""They tried to disrupt our democracy. They failed. 
***
""This failed attempt to obstruct the Congress, this failed insurrection, only underscores how crucial the task before us is for our Republic.  ""Our nation was founded precisely so that the free choice of the American people is what shapes our self-government and determines the destiny of our nation. ""Not fear. Not force.  ""But the peaceful expression of the popular will.  ""We assembled this afternoon to count our citizens’ votes and formalize their choice of the next president.  ""Now we are going to finish what we started.  ""We will complete this process the right way, by the book. We will follow our precedents, our laws, and our Constitution to the letter.  ""And we will certify the winner of the 2020 presidential election.  ""Criminal behavior will never dominate the United States Congress.  ""This institution is resilient.  ""Our democratic republic is strong.  ""The American people deserve nothing less.""

McConnell Statement on United States Capitol Security  Thursday, January 7, 2021 
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) issued the following statement today regarding yesterday’s events at the United States Capitol:   ""I salute and applaud those front-line U.S. Capitol Police officers who stood bravely in harm’s way during yesterday’s failed insurrection. We are praying today for those who sustained injuries, some serious, in the line of duty. Congress is also deeply grateful to the local officers from D.C., Virginia, and Maryland, the federal law enforcement personnel, the National Guard, and all the other professionals who deployed to help subdue the criminals and retake the Capitol.  ""With that said, yesterday represented a massive failure of institutions, protocols, and planning that are supposed to protect the first branch of our federal government. A painstaking investigation and thorough review must now take place and significant changes must follow. Initial bipartisan discussions have already begun among committees of oversight and Congressional Leadership.  ""The ultimate blame for yesterday lies with the unhinged criminals who broke down doors, trampled our nation’s flag, fought with law enforcement, and tried to disrupt our democracy, and with those who incited them. But this fact does not and will not preclude our addressing the shocking failures in the Capitol’s security posture and protocols."" 
### 
McConnell on the Resignation of the Senate Sergeant at Arms  Thursday, January 7, 2021 
WASHINGTON D.C. — United States Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) released the following statement today following Wednesday’s violence at the Capitol:   ""Today I requested and received the resignation of Michael Stenger, the Senate Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper, effective immediately.  ""Deputy Sergeant at Arms Jennifer Hemingway will now serve the Senate as Acting Sergeant at Arms, pursuant to statute. I thank Jennifer in advance for her service as we begin to examine the serious failures that transpired yesterday and continue and strengthen our preparations for a safe and successful inauguration on January 20th."" 
### 
McConnell Mourns the Death of USCP Officer Brian Sicknick  Friday, January 8, 2021 
WASHINGTON, D.C. – U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) issued the following statement today regarding the death of USCP Officer Brian Sicknick:   ""I was saddened and sickened to learn that Officer Brian D. Sicknick, a 12-year veteran of the United States Capitol Police, died following Wednesday’s violent attack on Congress.   “It appears the criminals who masqueraded as patriots have the blood of law enforcement on their hands. I hope the homicide investigation that is already underway will bring swift justice to anyone responsible for killing this officer.  ""The entire Senate grieves the death of this officer who literally put himself on the line to defend our first branch of government and everybody who works inside it. Our condolences and our prayers are with Officer Sicknick’s family and his colleagues at this terrible time.""

Dear Lindsey,
 
During the first week of this Congress, our democratic institutions underwent one of the toughest tests yet. Rioters breached the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to disrupt the process of formalizing the electoral college votes and honoring the will of the American people. In their wake, they left destruction and vandalism. I wish to express my sorrow at the loss of life, particularly that of Officer Brian Sicknick, and my appreciation for the work of the vastly outnumbered Capitol Police. Despite the disruption, they could not deter us from finishing the People's work. In the early hours of the morning on January 7, a joint session of Congress reconvened and approved the electoral college vote count from the 2020 election, affirming that Joe Biden will be the 46th President of the United States.
 
Losing an election is not easy for candidates or supporters. But it is not a reason to incite violence. It is also not a reason to push unfounded claims of wrongdoing and illegality in this election that have been dismissed in state and federal courts across the country, as some members of Congress have. As representatives, we have a duty to uphold the Constitution that we swore an oath to support and defend. We also need to be truthful with the people we serve. The truth isn't always what we want to hear, but I know the American people can handle it, and it's the only way we can foster trust in our government. These were the principles that guided me during this week's joint session.
 
This is why I defended Pennsylvania's votes when an objection to them was raised. There has been a lot of noise about the election in our Commonwealth, so I wanted to make it clear: our election was legal, fair, and free of widespread fraud. More than 20 lawsuits have brought us to that conclusion. This is what I covered in my remarks early Thursday morning during debate. You can watch them here.
  
￼
  
 
Working for you
 
  
On Sunday, we kicked off the 117th Congress. It is an honor to continue serving as your voice in Washington.
  
￼
  
My team and I are focused on helping Northeastern Pennsylvanians realize the fundamental American promise of opportunity for all. That means giving everyone a fair shot at a good education, a fulfilling job, quality health care, and a secure retirement.  It’s not lost on me, however, that our district, and Americans across the nation, are hurting from the devastating consequences of the COVID-19 crisis.  That’s why I am committed to helping us recover from this crisis and using my position on the Appropriations Committee to secure funding that will bolster the economy for all Northeastern Pennsylvanians.  This means bringing our fair share of federal dollars back home to expand rural broadband, to modernize infrastructure so businesses can grow, and redevelop abandoned mine lands, creating new economic hubs.  But that’s just the beginning. I want to hear from you.  Please complete this quick survey to share how my team and I can best support you and your family.

Note about Inauguration Ceremonies
 
  
On January 20, President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris will be sworn in as the next President and Vice President of the United States. Following the guidance of public health experts, the committee is asking Americans not to travel to Washington in order to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19. That means my office has not been given any public tickets to distribute to constituents like we have for past inaugurations. However, the presidential transition and the Joint Inaugural Committee are planning to enable Americans to participate in this ceremony in new and innovative ways while honoring our inaugural traditions. You can find out more on the Joint Inaugural Committee's website. 
  
 
Stay Connected
 
  
Thank you all for entrusting me to serve another term. I hope you will stay connected with me and my team as we work for Northeastern Pennsylvanians. Follow us on Twitter and like us on Facebook. 
 
Sincerely,

1/9/21 9:16,A Turning Point,"￼ 

January 9, 2021 
Dear Fellow Marylander: 
Well, 2021 was supposed to be the start of a fresh new year. Like other Marylanders, I had wished for a global reset and the opportunity to put our nation on a healthy, positive track for the future. An armed insurrection – a mob invasion of the United States Capitol Building – wasn’t on my bingo card. 
On Wednesday, January 6, after being told directly by President Donald Trump to march on the Capitol, thousands of his supporters did just that. Some came ready for a fight with pipe bombs, zip ties, guns and other weapons. Others swarmed the Capitol like unruly tourists, taking selfies, looking for prizes and vandalizing the seat of our government. 
To be clear, the invaders never should have made it into the Capitol, which is secured regularly for inaugurations, State of the Union addresses, and other major events. Why this mob was able to saunter through the building with seemingly little opposition has me fuming, but that will be a discussion for another time. I know Congress and appropriate law enforcement authorities will study in great detail to ensure it never happens again. 
As intense as this episode was for me – being locked down on the Senate floor and then swept away by security with my colleagues to a safer location – it really was a sad day for democracy. 
What happened Wednesday most certainly can be defined as domestic terrorism, if not sedition. It’s quite unfathomable that the sitting president of the United States encouraged this deadly chaos – an invasion of the United States Capitol. 
In fact, no one should have been too surprised that it came to this. The horrendous images we all witnessed were the natural culmination of years of divisive, racist and selfish language coming from Donald Trump. After four years in the White House, he has never learned that being president of the United States is about serving the country and not how the country can serve him. 
I know there are people who read this weekly email who supported Donald Trump. We disagree about that. However, after watching the images coming out of the Capitol this week, we should all agree that violent behavior and such blatant disregard for the rule of law can never be normalized – not in our country or any other. 
Since George Washington peacefully transferred power to his successor, John Adams, in March 1797, American democracy has set the standard worldwide for its orderly transitions. Elections with results much closer than 2020 were settled through civil discourse and peaceful debate. That streak has now been obliterated and America’s standing as a world leader of democracy and human rights has been shattered, similar to the glass windows of the House of Representatives. 
We can easily replace glass windows, but it will take years to rebuild America’s reputation and to rebuild trust within our country. 
Let me take a moment to thank the thousands of Marylanders who contacted my office by phone, email or other means over the last few days asking about my personal safety and that of our staff. It means the world to all of us that you cared enough to reach out and let us know you were thinking of us. Moments like these are when thoughts and prayers do the most good. 
I appreciated every text message and note about my safety, but my biggest concern coming out of Wednesday’s insurrection truly is the safety and the future of our republic. Democracy is fragile. It needs care and attention and a willingness to communicate and empathize with fellow citizens. So much of that was lacking on Wednesday. 
America is not perfect. But recognizing our faults and aspiring to do better is part of our ethos. Together, we must address the divisiveness that led us to this volatile point in history and resolve to find a peaceful way forward that upholds our values without tearing others down. Authoritarianism is not the American way, neither is mob rule. We must resolve to root out the causes of racism, anti-Semitism and all-too-casual hate and lawlessness that was on display at the Capitol this week and have been publicly erupting for years. 
On January 20, at the very same Capitol that was invaded and desecrated on Wednesday, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will take the oath to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” I stand ready to work with them and all Members of Congress to harness all the strength and goodwill of the American people to get us back on a path toward healing, redemption and trust. It will not be easy, but the prize is a nation that we can all be proud of, one that celebrates our common American experience and recognizes our incredible diversity as a strength. 
This week was a turning point for our country. A wake up call for some. An exclamation point for others. As President Theodore Roosevelt said, “This country will not be a permanently good place for any of us to live in unless we make it a reasonably good place for all of us to live in.”  That is our journey’s end, our mission. 
I am honored to represent the people of Maryland and thank you for sharing this journey with me. Please stay safe.

 Electoral College Certification
Since the election, I have supported President Trump’s mission to ensure every legal vote is counted and see that any potential irregularities are thoroughly investigated. I firmly believe that the media does not decide elections. The U.S. Constitution affords Americans the right to vote in free and fair elections, the hallmark of our democratic society. If we abandon this sacred practice, we abandon the Republic. I believe in the American process, and I believe every legal vote should count. I joined over 100 of my colleagues backing the Texas lawsuit in a brief to affirm for the court, and my constituents, our serious concerns with the integrity of our election system. After these legal challenges fell short, I reviewed the powers of the House, and I voted to support the electoral college certification objections to Arizona’s and Pennsylvania’s electoral votes on January 6th. I want to be clear - this decision was not about President Trump or any single politician. It was not even necessarily about this election. My decision was to protect the integrity of our future elections. While the election did not turn out the way I desired, the American people have spoken, and Joe Biden will be sworn in as the President of the United States.
The actions on Wednesday by those who lawlessly and forcefully entered the U.S. Capitol are disgraceful and reprehensible. These actions endangered Members of Congress, their staffs, U.S. Capitol Police officers, and employees at the Capitol. I wholeheartedly believe every American has the right to assemble afforded to them in the First Amendment, but the violence we witnessed was unacceptable, undemocratic, and un-American. Every member of the violent mob deserves to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. My prayers are with the families of those who died and those who are injured. Our democracy cannot be disrupted by criminal behavior. Mobs don’t rule America, laws do. This was true when our cities were burning this summer, and it is true now. We can disagree with each other without disliking each other. Let’s move forward together and get back to work.

1/9/21 8:57,A Turning Point,"￼ 

January 9, 2021 
Dear Fellow Marylander: 
Well, 2021 was supposed to be the start of a fresh new year. Like other Marylanders, I had wished for a global reset and the opportunity to put our nation on a healthy, positive track for the future. An armed insurrection – a mob invasion of the United States Capitol Building – wasn’t on my bingo card. 
On Wednesday, January 6, after being told directly by President Donald Trump to march on the Capitol, thousands of his supporters did just that. Some came ready for a fight with pipe bombs, zip ties, guns and other weapons. Others swarmed the Capitol like unruly tourists, taking selfies, looking for prizes and vandalizing the seat of our government. 
To be clear, the invaders never should have made it into the Capitol, which is secured regularly for inaugurations, State of the Union addresses, and other major events. Why this mob was able to saunter through the building with seemingly little opposition has me fuming, but that will be a discussion for another time. I know Congress and appropriate law enforcement authorities will study in great detail to ensure it never happens again. 
As intense as this episode was for me – being locked down on the Senate floor and then swept away by security with my colleagues to a safer location – it really was a sad day for democracy. 
What happened Wednesday most certainly can be defined as domestic terrorism, if not sedition. It’s quite unfathomable that the sitting president of the United States encouraged this deadly chaos – an invasion of the United States Capitol. 
In fact, no one should have been too surprised that it came to this. The horrendous images we all witnessed were the natural culmination of years of divisive, racist and selfish language coming from Donald Trump. After four years in the White House, he has never learned that being president of the United States is about serving the country and not how the country can serve him. 
I know there are people who read this weekly email who supported Donald Trump. We disagree about that. However, after watching the images coming out of the Capitol this week, we should all agree that violent behavior and such blatant disregard for the rule of law can never be normalized – not in our country or any other. 
Since George Washington peacefully transferred power to his successor, John Adams, in March 1797, American democracy has set the standard worldwide for its orderly transitions. Elections with results much closer than 2020 were settled through civil discourse and peaceful debate. That streak has now been obliterated and America’s standing as a world leader of democracy and human rights has been shattered, similar to the glass windows of the House of Representatives. 
We can easily replace glass windows, but it will take years to rebuild America’s reputation and to rebuild trust within our country. 
Let me take a moment to thank the thousands of Marylanders who contacted my office by phone, email or other means over the last few days asking about my personal safety and that of our staff. It means the world to all of us that you cared enough to reach out and let us know you were thinking of us. Moments like these are when thoughts and prayers do the most good. 
I appreciated every text message and note about my safety, but my biggest concern coming out of Wednesday’s insurrection truly is the safety and the future of our republic. Democracy is fragile. It needs care and attention and a willingness to communicate and empathize with fellow citizens. So much of that was lacking on Wednesday. 
America is not perfect. But recognizing our faults and aspiring to do better is part of our ethos. Together, we must address the divisiveness that led us to this volatile point in history and resolve to find a peaceful way forward that upholds our values without tearing others down. Authoritarianism is not the American way, neither is mob rule. We must resolve to root out the causes of racism, anti-Semitism and all-too-casual hate and lawlessness that was on display at the Capitol this week and have been publicly erupting for years. 
On January 20, at the very same Capitol that was invaded and desecrated on Wednesday, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will take the oath to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” I stand ready to work with them and all Members of Congress to harness all the strength and goodwill of the American people to get us back on a path toward healing, redemption and trust. It will not be easy, but the prize is a nation that we can all be proud of, one that celebrates our common American experience and recognizes our incredible diversity as a strength. 
This week was a turning point for our country. A wake up call for some. An exclamation point for others. As President Theodore Roosevelt said, “This country will not be a permanently good place for any of us to live in unless we make it a reasonably good place for all of us to live in.”  That is our journey’s end, our mission. 
I am honored to represent the people of Maryland and thank you for sharing this journey with me. Please stay safe.

Q: What is the Electoral College?

Quick Links
This week’s violent attack on the U.S. Capitol was an attack on American democracy itself. 
These were un-American acts worthy only of condemnation. Those who plowed over police barricades, ignored law enforcement or desecrated our monument to representative democracy flouted the rule of law and disgraced our nation. 
Congress has no role in conducting elections or adjudicating election disputes, only receiving and formally counting the electoral votes cast in each state. 
I swore to uphold the Constitution, and that is why I did not support any effort to undermine the constitutional role of states in elections. I share the frustration of many Americans and I’m also concerned about claims of irregularities. 
Going forward, it’s important that state legislatures closely scrutinize the events of this election and take necessary steps to promote independence, transparency and trust in future elections.

Our Duty to Uphold our Constitution and Rule of Law
 
 January 9, 2021
  
Dear Friends,
This week, as Congress gathered to undertake one of our most solemn duties—counting electoral votes and confirming the will of the people in the Presidential election—a violent mob broke through the doors of the U.S. Capitol.
As rioters forced their way inside, the doors to our House chamber were locked and my colleagues and I were asked to hide under chairs to prevent being struck by stray bullets. When we were able to evacuate the House gallery, we did so by jumping over rows of chairs while wearing gas masks as officers barricaded the doors with guns drawn.
This violent assault on the seat of our American government caused dozens of injuries and five deaths so far, including that of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick who died defending us and the very foundations of our republic.
This disgraceful incursion—incited by President Trump as he revved up the crowd and set our Capitol as its target—was nothing less than an attempted coup.
The violence that took place on January 6th was not isolated. At every turn, Trump has undermined our rule of law and the safety and security of the American people. This was just the latest escalation following years of fanning the flames of suspicion, conspiracy and division for his own political gain. 
For our republic and all it stands for, President Trump must be removed from office immediately.
Despite this assault, and despite the continuation of baseless electoral fraud claims, the will of the American people prevailed. Democracy prevailed. We swore an oath to uphold the Constitution and that’s exactly what we did, working through the night and into Thursday morning to complete our appointed role and send a clear message: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be our next President and Vice President of the United States. And they will be sworn in, by the expressed will of the American people, at noon on January 20th.
As we pick up the pieces and work to restore justice and the faith of the American people, we must find that path of rebuilding our nation, our credibility, our laws and our spirit of liberty, unity and justice for all.
And we must do it while addressing some of the greatest challenges America has ever faced. I stand ready to work with you, our leaders at every level of government, and the many leaders and public servants in the Biden-Harris Administration as we tackle these challenges and fight to ensure liberty, justice and a brighter future for all.  
And, as always, thank you for reading.
 Your friend, ￼ 
 
DID YOU KNOW?
Throughout this pandemic, my office and I have worked to make sure you remain informed with the latest updates and recommendations on any and all COVID-19 related topics. With that in mind here is some information from the IRS that may be of interest to you:
	•	On December 29, the IRS and the Treasury Department began delivering a second round of Economic Impact Payments as part of the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021 to millions of Americans who received the first round of payments earlier this year.
	◦	The initial direct deposit payments began arriving as of Dec. 29 for some and will continue into next week. Paper checks were beginning to be mailed on Dec. 30.
	•	No action required by eligible individuals to receive this second payment. 
	•	Anyone who received the first round of payments earlier this year but doesn’t receive a payment via direct deposit will generally receive a check or, in some instances, a debit card.
	◦	Direct deposits. For those who have not yet received direct deposits, they should continue to watch their bank accounts for a deposit in coming days. 
	◦	Mail. Some people will receive their second Economic Impact Payment by mail, either as a paper check or in the form of a debit card. For people in this group, the IRS urges people to carefully watch their mail for either of these during January. Additional information is available on IRS.gov. 
	◦	Tax returns. Eligible taxpayers who don’t receive a payment – or the full amount – can claim the Recovery Rebate Credit when they file their 2020 tax return. Taxpayers in this situation are urged to file electronically with direct deposit to ensure their tax refund – and their stimulus payment – reach them as soon as possible. 
	◦	Additional information on Get My Payment. The IRS reassures taxpayers who do not recognize the bank account number displayed in the Get My Payment tool that deposits were not made to the wrong account; this is not an indicator of fraud. If you do not recognize the account number, it may be an issue related to how information is displayed in the tool tied to temporary accounts used for refund loans/banking products. The IRS is working to address this. People do not need to complete Form 14039, Identity Theft Affidavit, or contact the IRS.  
	•	A Frequently Asked Questions page on the second round of Economic Impact Payments is now available HERE.

1/8/21 23:39,Our Democracy will prevail.,"
￼
￼
￼

Dear Lindsey,

The insurrection that occurred at the U.S. Capitol yesterday as Congress was carrying out its Constitutional duty was enabled and provoked by President Trump. The president incited an attack on our democracy and our democratic process, and for that, he must be impeached immediately and be barred from holding federal elected office ever again.

Watching the coverage of insurgents in Trump campaign memorabilia and waving Confederate flags storming the Capitol building was chilling. These individuals must be arrested and held accountable for engaging in violence, breaking into the Capitol, and disrupting a fundamental aspect of our peaceful transfer of power, the certification of the Electoral College votes.

That day should serve as a reminder that our democracy does not run on auto-pilot, we must fight to uphold it, and the words and actions of elected officials matter. I urge my Republican colleagues who are supporting Trump’s anti-democratic charade, peddling conspiracies, and opposing the certification of certain Electoral College votes to cease their efforts to undermine our democracy and our democratic process. History, America, and the rest of the world have their eyes on you.

While the violent events that unfolded at the Capitol yesterday delayed the certification of the Electoral College votes, Congress will not be deterred – early this morning we carried out our Constitutional duty and certified that Joe Biden will be the 46th President of the United States. Our democracy will prevail. 

Sincerely,
￼
￼

1/8/21 21:58,We Must Protect Our Democracy,"￼ 
Dear Lindsey,
I hope this message finds you and your loved ones safe and healthy. The failed coup attempt we witnessed on Wednesday was a direct attack on our democracy, and I want to share my thoughts with you. Click below to watch my video message or read the transcript below:
￼
Click here to watch my video message.
Hello, I’m Veronica Escobar, Congresswoman for the 16th district of Texas. I wanted to take a few minutes to address the tragic events of January 6th, a day that should not have been about an uncontroversial but historic process: Congress’s constitutional obligation to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election – which President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris won, decisively.
First, I want to extend my sincerest condolences to the family of United States Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who was killed in the line of duty — bludgeoned to his death with a fire extinguisher as he tried to defend our democracy and protect the Capitol and all of us inside. Other members of Capitol Police were also seriously injured, and as we await news on their status, I want to extend my sympathy to their families who should not have to be living through this pain.
 Also, I want to thank El Pasoans for your words of kindness, for sending me so much love and support. Your concern for me, my colleagues, and everyone who works at the Capitol meant so much to me, and I am grateful for every message, email, and phone call. You gave me great comfort and provided me further inspiration and determination to go back into that House chamber and finish the work we’d started that day.
All of America, and the world, witnessed a deadly insurrection that was inspired and incited by President Donald J. Trump and his enablers in Congress, enablers who prey on those who are too willing to believe conspiracies and lies. While each and every individual who plotted and engaged in the violence and chaos that led to the siege of the Capitol must be identified and criminally charged, there should be no doubt that Donald Trump and the lawmakers responsible for bringing America to her knees must also be held accountable.
 This is the second domestic terrorist attack I have personally lived through, and I will say again what I said on August 3, 2019: words have consequences, and I hold Donald Trump responsible for the words he uses to fuel hate, sow division, and spread lies that have led to America’s darkest days.
My colleagues and I have called on Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment and protect us from a man who is a dangerous national security risk; but in case there is an absence of courage on that front, I also am co-leading articles of impeachment against Donald Trump in order to remove him from office and prevent him from sullying the office of the President ever again. We need to exercise every constitutional option we have to prevent further destruction to the United States of America.
Beyond the immediate and urgent need to protect our country from additional imminent threats, we need to acknowledge the longer-term threat and that is the frailty of our democracy. 
During the impeachment process in late 2019, I repeatedly said that the constitution is only a piece of paper unless we believe it, live it, and hold ourselves accountable to it.
The tragedy of January 6th didn’t begin that day — that day was an unfortunate and expected outcome of years of misinformation, conspiracies, and lies spread by millions of Americans who have placed one man above our Republic and our democracy. 
The damage done is profound. Our country is still under assault from within, and this is a tragedy that weakens us, puts each and every one of us at risk, and emboldens our enemies — those domestic and abroad.
 So how do repair the damage?
We must do a better job of teaching our history because we have seen how doomed we are every time we repeat it; we must teach the value and importance of our Constitution and the truth behind the work our Founding Fathers did to protect us from tyranny, authoritarianism, and to protect us from ourselves; and, we must do what we can at every turn to expose and reject the misinformation intended to destroy our country.
 On January 6th, my beloved friend and colleague, Congressman Jamie Raskin, a constitutional scholar who was trapped in the House Chamber with me and others — showed up to argue against the objections to certify the election despite the fact that he had just lost his son days before. He set his grief aside to remind us of what was at stake. 
He reminded us that President John Adams, after transferring power to his successor said that we are a government of laws, not of men - and women – adding: “We will betray this principle if we trade a government of laws for a government of men or, even worse, a single man, or an impressionable and dangerous mob intent on violent sedition and insurrection against our beloved democratic Republic.”
 We have the greatest democracy in the world. And we are privileged to live in the United States of America, but with that privilege comes an obligation to ensure that the democracy we inherited is protected and passed on to our children.
Those of us who live in El Paso have the added privilege of living in a community that has set the example during times of crisis time and again: And what El Pasoans do is take care of one another.  Let’s continue to do that, and let’s take care of our country as well. God bless each and every one of you and God bless America.
Sincerely,
￼
Veronica Escobar Member of Congress

January 8, 2021
￼ 
Aloha, Friend.
 
This past Sunday, January 3rd, I again took the oath to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic” as your U.S. Representative throughout the new 117th Congress (2021-2023).
 
On Monday, I taped my first Congressman Ed Case Reports public broadcasting show back to you of this Congress. On Tuesday, I had my first of many weekly meetings with my new partner in the House, U.S. Representative Kaiali’i Kahele.
 
On Wednesday, a violent assault, incited by senior leaders of our country including the President, was mounted on the U.S. Capitol with the intent to disrupt and influence Congress’ obligation to review and decide whether to certify the Presidential election. Early Thursday at 3:41 AM, Congress completed our duty and the results were certified. By later Thursday, the death toll from the assault stood at five, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer, and I joined many colleagues in supporting the immediate removal of the President from office.
 
What a truly dark chapter for our country and our democracy, with so much damage to our foundations and institutions in such a brief time. But I know that this is not the America the vast majority of us of whatever stripe honor and cherish and stand for, and I know we will get through this dark time together.
 
Yet, that will not just happen. We must obtain full accountability, lest we send the message to future generations and leaders that our Constitution and laws mean so little. We must learn and address the painful lessons of this chapter, lest they are repeated. And we must continue the governance of our country and, for me, the representation of our Hawai’i, through the crisis of COVID-19 and beyond.
 
In that spirit, I report back to you again and ask for your continued guidance.
 
Confirmation of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election Results
 
The national popular vote was legally certified by each state. The resulting Electoral College vote was legally certified by the electors. Dozens of court cases alleging wrongdoing were rejected by the courts, and additional claims were not submitted to the courts.
 
The final step under our laws is Congress’ review of the Electoral College results. This review occurs state by state, with at least one U.S. Representative and one U.S. Senator required to object to maintain a valid objection for any state. Valid objections were raised for only two states - Arizona and Pennsylvania – meaning that for all other states there were no objections by at least one Representative and Senator.
 
The two valid objections were fully debated. The final votes were: (1) for Arizona, U.S. Senate, 93-6 against the objection and for the Electoral College result (including 44 Republicans against), and U.S. House, 303-121 against (including 83 Republicans against); and (2) for Pennsylvania, Senate, 92-7 against (45 Republicans), and House, 282-138 against (64 Republicans).
 
I voted against both objections because, after carefully considering the objectors’ arguments, I did not hear any that had not already been addressed by the state election certifiers and courts or were otherwise supported by any credible evidence.
 
Removal of the President from Office
 
Here is my public statement of yesterday:
 
“The President’s recent actions, including his flagrant attempted subversion of our election process and his incitement of yesterday’s violent attack on our U.S. Capitol, cross any reasonable line into an assault on our very foundations.
 
“They demonstrate that the President is an immediate danger to our democracy, our country and our citizens, justifying his removal from office for inability to discharge his duties under our Constitution.
 
“That his Administration will end in thirteen days is no reason not to remove him now. The power of the Presidency is immense, and its continued abuse cannot be risked. And the precedent of acceding to such abuse cannot be accepted.
 
“I urge Vice President Pence and the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to our Constitution, which provides an expedited procedure to remove the President for such disability.
 
“I am also reviewing specific impeachment proposals if the 25th Amendment is not invoked.”
 
I fully expect that, unless the Vice President and Cabinet act or the President resigns, the U.S. House will act this coming week.

1/8/21 21:00,My Op-Ed on Wednesday's Events,"
￼

Right now, our nation is healing from a heartbreaking day at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. Many of you have reached out to me with questions and concerns about these recent events.  

Here is my op-ed in the Spokesman Review from yesterday:  

We must have a peaceful transfer of power  

What happened yesterday (Wednesday) was disgraceful and un-American. Thugs assaulted Capitol Police officers, breached and defaced our Capitol Building, put people’s lives in danger, and disregarded the values we hold dear as Americans. To anyone involved, shame on you. 

The reality in America today is that people are angry and are losing trust in our institutions. We, unfortunately, saw that to an unacceptable extreme yesterday (Wednesday), and we’ve seen it over the past year with riots across the United States and in cities like Portland and Seattle. We will not fix this unless each one of us starts doing our part to restore trust and confidence and build bridges to seek understanding with one another. It takes each one of us doing our part to build a more perfect union. 

I also believe we must have a peaceful transfer of power. The only reason for my intention to object to some Electoral College votes was to give voice to the concern that governors and courts unilaterally changed election procedures without the will of the people and outside of the legislative process. I have been consistent in my belief that Americans should use the Constitutional tools and legal processes available to seek answers to their questions about the 2020 election. 

The Constitution gives state legislatures the authority to set the election laws within their states, a process that ensures the people’s voices are amplified through their elected representatives. I have long been concerned about the power that the legislative branch, at both the state and national levels, has ceded to the executive and judicial branches. Leading up to the 2020 Presidential Election, in some states, decisions about state election law moved outside of the legislative branch. In Georgia, the Secretary of State changed the process for verifying signatures on mail-in ballots, and in Pennsylvania, the state Supreme Court unilaterally extended the deadline to accept mail-in ballots. There are examples we can point to in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Nevada, too. In each of these states, the voices of “We, The People” were silenced. 

Our opportunity for discussion and debate on the election was interrupted and ended because of what happened yesterday. What we have seen is unlawful and unacceptable. I made the decision yesterday (Wednesday) that I would not vote to object to the Electoral College counts and I encourage Donald Trump to condemn and put an end to this madness. It’s time to move on.

Yet, that will not just happen. We must obtain full accountability, lest we send the message to future generations and leaders that our Constitution and laws mean so little. We must learn and address the painful lessons of this chapter, lest they are repeated. And we must continue the governance of our country and, for me, the representation of our Hawai’i, through the crisis of COVID-19 and beyond.
 
In that spirit, I report back to you again and ask for your continued guidance.
 
Confirmation of the Presidential and Vice Presidential Election Results
 
The national popular vote was legally certified by each state. The resulting Electoral College vote was legally certified by the electors. Dozens of court cases alleging wrongdoing were rejected by the courts, and additional claims were not submitted to the courts.
 
The final step under our laws is Congress’ review of the Electoral College results. This review occurs state by state, with at least one U.S. Representative and one U.S. Senator required to object to maintain a valid objection for any state. Valid objections were raised for only two states - Arizona and Pennsylvania – meaning that for all other states there were no objections by at least one Representative and Senator.
 
The two valid objections were fully debated. The final votes were: (1) for Arizona, U.S. Senate, 93-6 against the objection and for the Electoral College result (including 44 Republicans against), and U.S. House, 303-121 against (including 83 Republicans against); and (2) for Pennsylvania, Senate, 92-7 against (45 Republicans), and House, 282-138 against (64 Republicans).
 
I voted against both objections because, after carefully considering the objectors’ arguments, I did not hear any that had not already been addressed by the state election certifiers and courts or were otherwise supported by any credible evidence.
 
Removal of the President from Office
 
Here is my public statement of yesterday:
 
“The President’s recent actions, including his flagrant attempted subversion of our election process and his incitement of yesterday’s violent attack on our U.S. Capitol, cross any reasonable line into an assault on our very foundations.
 
“They demonstrate that the President is an immediate danger to our democracy, our country and our citizens, justifying his removal from office for inability to discharge his duties under our Constitution.
 
“That his Administration will end in thirteen days is no reason not to remove him now. The power of the Presidency is immense, and its continued abuse cannot be risked. And the precedent of acceding to such abuse cannot be accepted.
 
“I urge Vice President Pence and the Cabinet to invoke the 25th Amendment to our Constitution, which provides an expedited procedure to remove the President for such disability.
 
“I am also reviewing specific impeachment proposals if the 25th Amendment is not invoked.”
 
I fully expect that, unless the Vice President and Cabinet act or the President resigns, the U.S. House will act this coming week.

1/8/21 20:34,Addressing the Attack on the U.S. Capitol Building,"COVID-19 Update | January 8, 2020
View Email in Browser 
￼ 

Dear Friend,

By now, many of you have heard and read of the tragic and disturbing attack that took place at the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday. You have viewed the horrifying video and photographic images. I am deeply saddened and outraged by the actions of those involved in this uncivil and devastating act.

I condemn the rioters’ destruction, mayhem, and malice towards the peaceful conduct of the business of democracy in the People’s House. We are a nation of law and order, and it was disgraceful that the safety and security of citizens and the historic structure that houses the first branch of government were needlessly put at risk.

Make no mistake that the Founding Fathers foresaw an event like this that occured on Wednesday. They anticipated the unrest that follows when the legislative branch holds too much power in determining who serves as the president and vice president of our country.

The dissemination of the misleading perception, by the president and others, that Congress somehow could overturn an election was reckless. This view does not align with the U.S. Constitution. The framers of the Constitution carefully debated and designed our system whereby the president would be elected under rules determined by the individual states and with electors selected in the states. This diffusion of power in separating Washington from the selection of the president was set to prevent the boiling over of passion and heat that we watched unfold on January 6th. Faithful to the U.S. Constitution, which I took an oath to uphold, I voted to uphold the results of the Electoral College, which were certified by the individual states on December 14, 2020. Please see my statement from the morning of January 6th HERE.

I have listened carefully to central Arkansans and their concerns about election security, and I can assure you that election integrity is one of my top priorities for the 117th Congress. I support the idea of a federal commission to review the November 2020 election, assess procedures and any irregularities, and make recommendations to the states for any needed reform. As I have said on CNBC, Fox Business, and local television, we must have faith in our government; we must have faith in our election results. Elections are the cornerstone of our democracy, and if we wish to preserve our democracy, we must ensure that all our citizens have confidence in our electoral process.

For generations, the United States of America has witnessed a peaceful transition of power on Inauguration Day; it’s a hallmark of our society and our nation and a day that sets us apart from oppressive and unstable nation states. As we move toward the executive transition at noon on January 20th, I am preparing my work with the new 117th Congress and the incoming administration to expand opportunity for all of our families, bolster our national security, and provide American leadership on the global stage. These goals reflect the values of the hardworking women and men of central Arkansans who sent me to Washington – this is especially important as we work to rapidly distribute the vaccines, defeat the menacing coronavirus, and restore our economy and prosperity. Thank you for the many expressions of support and concern that I received from folks across Arkansas and the nation. Please keep our country in your prayers.

Sincerely,
￼ 
Representative French Hill

1/8/21 20:31,Senator Bennet’s Weekly Update,"A message from Senator Michael Bennet 
￼
Hello everyone,  
Wednesday was a terrible day for our country. Americans and the world watched in shock and embarrassment as a mob breached and ransacked our Capitol, urged on by the President and his enablers in Congress and the media.   
After the mob riot at the Capitol, I couldn’t help but think we were living out our Founders’ worst fears. Unlike us, the Founders knew their history and appreciated its lessons. When they wrote our Constitution, they understood what happened to the Roman Republic when armed gangs––doing the work of politicians––prevented citizens from casting their ballots and keeping elections from ever starting or from ever being called. In the end, the spiral of dysfunction led the Roman Republic to fall and a dictator to rise in its place.
￼ 
(Speaking Wednesday night on the Senate floor) 
If we are to avoid this fate, the recent assault on our Constitution cannot go unanswered. Those who organized and led the assault, those who followed them, and those who incited them – none should be beyond the reach of justice. We must reject lawlessness and reassert the rule of law. We must repudiate authoritarianism and reclaim democracy. As I said on the Senate floor Wednesday night, as elected leaders we have a responsibility to tell people the truth and protect our institutions from politicians who will stop at nothing to hold onto power. 
That includes President Trump. Last year, I voted to remove him from office for his crimes against our republic. Since then, his unconstitutional wrongdoing has only grown worse. The president should resign immediately, and if he does not, Vice President Pence should invoke the 25th Amendment and remove him from office. Failing that, I will support any effort to impeach the president and uphold the rule of law – including steps beyond January 20 if required. 
This is a perilous moment for our republic, but as I told my daughters on Wednesday after they called me worried about the attack on the Capitol, we will make it to the other side of this crisis. Then comes the task of ensuring that our republic emerges from this crisis stronger, not weaker. We have seen where a politics of lies, dysfunction, and division has brought us. Instead, let us move forward with renewed commitment to truth, integrity, unity, and a commitment to our shared destiny as Americans.

Dear Friend,
My thoughts and prayers go out to Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick and his family, as we learned of his passing last night.  The Capitol police serve our nation well, and this violence is inexcusable.
Dr. Rand Paul Honors Jim Milliman 
This week, we lost my former State Director and long-time senior adviser, Jim Milliman, who passed away after long-term complications due to a previous stroke.
Kelley and I, and our entire team, are heartbroken over the loss of our dear friend.  Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Nan and all those who had the honor of knowing Jim. 
He was a great American, proud Kentuckian, loyal teammate, and loving husband.  He will be truly missed.  
In October 2019, I spoke on the U.S. Senate floor in honor of Jim as he retired from the State Director position and transitioned into a senior adviser role:
""I rise today to honor and pay tribute to one of the most tenacious and dedicated Kentuckians I’ve had the pleasure of knowing, Mr. Jim Milliman.  
""Jim began his career in 1964, after graduating from the University of Notre Dame. He subsequently graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of Louisville Law School in 1970.  
""He married Nan Milliman, and they made their home in Louisville, KY.  They have been married for 48 years.  
""When I first met Jim, I knew him as one of Kentucky’s finest attorneys, who represented Brown & Williamson during their tobacco litigation and the state Republicans in election law matters.  I knew him as an accomplished managing partner of the Louisville-based law firm, Middleton Reutlinger. 
""And I knew him as the fiery conservative co-host who often sat opposite Congressman John Yarmuth on WAVE 3 TV’s political show ‘Hot Button’ for spirited debates.  
""After over 40 successful years in commercial litigation, and numerous awards from his peers, such as being named one of the top 50 attorneys in Kentucky, Jim decided to retire….  From the law at least.  
""In 2010, right after I was elected to the Senate, I went out on a limb, and I asked Jim to come back out of retirement to be my State Director for Kentucky.  I am truly grateful that he said yes, because for nearly a decade, Jim has served in that role and been one of my most trusted advisers.  
""Anyone who knows Jim knows that he is a force to be reckoned with.  He is fiercely loyal, a real problem solver, and a highly accomplished legal mind.  Moreover, he is an incredibly kind person who cares deeply about his friends and colleagues. 
""When I ran for President, Jim spearheaded the approval of a caucus for Kentucky so I would not be kept from the ballot for President and the U.S. Senate.  
""Recently, Jim has decided to transition from the daily State Director duties into more of an advisory role.   
“Considering he tried to retire over 10 years ago, I think it’s well deserved!  No matter in what capacity, I will always be thankful to have Jim as a part of my team, as an ally and adviser. 
""He has dedicated so much of his time to the pursuit of liberty and freedom… to defending the principles that made this nation great… to supporting a pro-Kentucky policy agenda.  
""Thank you, Jim, for your service to Kentucky and this country.  
""I yield the floor.""

Dr. Rand Paul: “We Simply Cannot Destroy the Constitution, Our Laws, and the Electoral College in the Process"" 
On Wednesday, the U.S. Congress convened in a joint session to receive the 2020 presidential election certifications from the states and debate any challenges.
This constitutional task would sadly and tragically be temporarily halted by chaos and violence that ultimately led to loss of life, including Capitol Police Officer Sicknick’s. 
After legislators, staff, and reporters were forced to take shelter, I urged an end to the violence, tweeting this message: 
￼ 
I also released the following speech, where I condemned the violence and stated that I would vote to certify the election results to protect our federalist system and respect each state’s right to conduct elections:  
""I wrote a speech for today. 
""I was planning to say that I fear the chaos of establishing a precedent that Congress can overturn elections.  
“Boy, was I right. 
""Chaos.  Anarchy.  The violence today was wrong and un-American. 
""The vote we are about to cast is incredibly important.
""Now more than ever.  
“The question is: 
""Should Congress override the certified results from the states and nullify the states’ right to conduct elections? 
""The vote today is not a protest; the vote today is literally to overturn the election! 
""Voting to overturn state-certified elections would be the opposite of what states’ rights Republicans have always advocated for.
""This would doom the electoral college forever. 
""It was never intended by our founders that Congress have the power to overturn state-certified elections. 
“My oath to the Constitution doesn’t allow me to disobey the law.  I cannot vote to overturn the verdict of the states. 
""Such a vote would be to overturn everything held dear by those of us who support the rights of states in this great system of federalism bequeathed to us by our founders. 
""The electoral college was created to devolve the power of selecting presidential electors to the states. 
""The electoral college is, without question, an inseparable friend to those who believe that every American across our vast country deserves to be heard.
""If Congress were given the power to overturn the states’ elections . . . what terrible chaos would ensue. 
""Imagine the furor against the electoral college if Congress becomes a forum to overturn states’ electoral college slates.
""It is one thing to be angry.  It is another to focus one’s anger in a constructive way. That hasn’t happened today, to say the least.  We simply cannot destroy the Constitution, our laws, and the electoral college in the process.  I hope as the nation’s anger cools, we can channel that energy into essential electoral reforms in every state.
""America is admired around the world for our free elections.  We must, we absolutely must, fix this mess and restore confidence and integrity to our elections.""

ICYMI: Dr. Rand Paul Congratulates Christopher II X on Pardon from President Trump 
In case you missed it over the holidays, I wanted to share my statement with you congratulating Louisville’s Christopher II X, Executive Director of Christopher 2X Game Changers, on receiving a pardon from President Trump shortly before Christmas:
""I just finished speaking with Christopher II X to congratulate him on receiving a full pardon from President Trump.  This pardon is the culmination of hard work and perseverance on the part of many, including the diligent work of my staff and me for the last several years.  As someone who made a choice to change his life for the better and then dedicated that life to lifting up his community, there is truly no one more deserving of this honor.  We are so appreciative of all he has done for Louisville, and I’m honored to call him a friend.""
Christopher II X said the following after the news broke: 
""I’m extremely grateful to be pardoned by President Trump.  I’ve worked hard for the past 20 years for peace and justice and to help those impacted by gun violence, especially children.  I’m proud to continue this work which is needed more than ever. I thank U.S. Senator Rand Paul, former U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Rob Givens, and special thanks to Spalding University President Tori Murden McClure, and University of Louisville Hospital’s Chief of Surgery Dr. J. David Richardson for their support.""
Making a Difference: Fancy Farm, Kentucky, Elementary Principal Janet Throgmorton  
In the midst of the headlines that have seemed so overwhelming over the past year, we have also seen stories of Americans pulling together, looking out for one another, and leading by example.
I wanted to share one such recent story on NBC News’ website with you regarding elementary school Principal Janet Throgmorton in Fancy Farm, Kentucky, who has faced the pandemic head-on and used her innovation, dedication, and flexibility to keep students engaged and learning. 
Here’s just one example from the story: 
This principal, when faced with a bus driver shortage (currently, both of her bus drivers have Covid-19, including one on a ventilator for 38 days) got her commercial driver’s license so she could drive the routes herself and give all students transportation to school.  “Plus, when we have field trips, all I have to pay for is mileage, not buses ― much friendlier on my budget,” Throgmorton told me. 
Principal Throgmorton is an asset to the educational system in Kentucky, and I commend her actions on behalf of the students and community in Graves County. 
You can read the full story HERE. 
Media Wrap-Up 
Shortly before Congress resumed its joint session on Wednesday night, I called in to Fox News’ The Story with Martha MacCallum to discuss the day’s events.

January 8, 2021
￼ 
Aloha, Friend.
 
This past Sunday, January 3rd, I again took the oath to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic” as your U.S. Representative throughout the new 117th Congress (2021-2023).
 
On Monday, I taped my first Congressman Ed Case Reports public broadcasting show back to you of this Congress. On Tuesday, I had my first of many weekly meetings with my new partner in the House, U.S. Representative Kaiali’i Kahele.
 
On Wednesday, a violent assault, incited by senior leaders of our country including the President, was mounted on the U.S. Capitol with the intent to disrupt and influence Congress’ obligation to review and decide whether to certify the Presidential election. Early Thursday at 3:41 AM, Congress completed our duty and the results were certified. By later Thursday, the death toll from the assault stood at five, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer, and I joined many colleagues in supporting the immediate removal of the President from office.
 
What a truly dark chapter for our country and our democracy, with so much damage to our foundations and institutions in such a brief time. But I know that this is not the America the vast majority of us of whatever stripe honor and cherish and stand for, and I know we will get through this dark time together.
 
Yet, that will not just happen. We must obtain full accountability, lest we send the message to future generations and leaders that our Constitution and laws mean so little. We must learn and address the painful lessons of this chapter, lest they are repeated. And we must continue the governance of our country and, for me, the representation of our Hawai’i, through the crisis of COVID-19 and beyond.
 
In that spirit, I report back to you again and ask for your continued guidance.

I voted against both objections because, after carefully considering the objectors’ arguments, I did not hear any that had not already been addressed by the state election certifiers and courts or were otherwise supported by any credible evidence.

A Grim Day in American History and Our Next Steps to Secure and Strengthen Our Democracy and Our Country
On Wednesday, Republicans and Democrats gathered in Washington to certify Joe Biden’s election as President. Our job, governed by both the Constitution and a law passed almost one hundred fifty years ago, says Congress must open and count certified electoral votes from the states. These requirements ensure a transparent process in a critical step of the peaceful transfer of power, the bedrock of our democracy.  And, as everyone now well knows, our work was violently disrupted. An unlawful mob of armed insurrectionists stormed the United States Capitol and threatened to stop a key step in the process of transferring power to a new president. Their purpose was to keep Donald Trump in power, overthrowing the will of a large majority of Americans who voted in November’s election.  This insurrection is destined to be remembered as one of the grimmest days in the history of our democracy.  I am grateful to the Capitol Police officers and other members of law enforcement who put themselves in harm’s way to keep members of Congress, staff, and the media safe. And my prayers are with the family of Officer Brian Sicknick who lost his life following this attack.   It was a destructive and un-American scene, and the individuals involved must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  Amid the fear and terror that shook all of us, members of the Senate and House of Representatives were determined to continue our work and complete the certification. It was critical for our country and the entire world to see the Senate and House reconvene in our chambers, finish our work, and certify the election that night. Insurrectionists could not have the last word. Our democracy is stronger than they are.  But in the aftermath of this awfulness, it is incumbent upon every American to do some deep reflection about what occurred and why. We need a reset and recommitment to our national norms and traditions. We must find a way to continue the work to address the enormous challenges we face as a large, spirited collection of people from a huge range of backgrounds, but with a common purpose and belief — that individual freedom and dignity, for all people, is the best springboard for personal success, economic growth, and international strength and leadership that there is.    We all need to think about what it means to be a citizen in a democracy – and how to engage with our fellow citizens when we disagree. How we can once again at least agree to common sets of facts, even if we disagree about solutions.  This isn’t just about politics or winning a particular policy debate, or even an election. Our capacity to protect the fundamental values and freedom that we hold dear will impact everything that we do.  There is a lot of work ahead of us. I have been proud to join with a bipartisan coalition of Republicans and Democrats in Congress who have worked to rise above partisanship and deliver results on key priorities. We came together to help deliver a bipartisan COVID relief package. We came together to stand up for the integrity of our elections, and against those attempting to undermine confidence in them. And we came together to speak out against the attacks America witnessed this week.   This partnership gives me hope for a path forward in what will be a closely divided Congress, and in a divided nation. It gives me hope that we can find ways to acknowledge differences, but then identify common purpose and forge solutions that reflect both.    I will do my best to do my part, but I can’t do it alone — nor can the other members of Congress, state legislatures, governors, or the President of the United States. Democracy requires tending. At its roots. Talk to your children, to your neighbors, and to your colleagues about why you love being an American. I think you’ll find that, regardless of political party, you have a lot in common. And it is that common base that must be the foundation for our next chapter.  Be safe. Be strong. And be welcoming. 
With every good wish,  ￼   Senator Maggie Hassan

1/8/21 19:39,Standing up for our democracy,"
￼

Dear friends and neighbors, 

On Wednesday, January 6, 2021, as Congress met to certify the results of the 2020 Presidential Election, our nation experienced one of the darkest moments in American history. 

Incited by President Donald Trump and a group of extremist Republican Members of Congress, domestic terrorists breached our United States Capitol and attacked the very cornerstone of our democracy. When these rioters stormed into the Capitol building, I took cover and shortly evacuated to a safe undisclosed location. 

￼

Hours after this domestic terrorist attack, we returned to the House Chamber to defend the constitution. Early the next morning, we certified Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as the next President and Vice President of the United States. Our democracy survived. 

However, armed insurrection against our democracy will carry a heavy price. That is why I’m joining my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to call for President Trump's removal, either by the 25th amendment or impeachment. Whichever the means, we can no longer allow the treasonous President Trump to remain in office. 

COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution in the District

Despite the situation in Washington, DC, it is crucial for us to continue showing up for Florida's 9th District. As COVID-19 infections rise in Central Florida, we are working with local officials to provide up-to-date information on vaccinations. For more information on your counties distributions plans, please visit the websites linked below.

Calling upon our better angels 
By: Senator Mitt Romney 
Editor’s note: This essay appears in the January/February issue of Deseret Magazine. Though it was written prior to the terrible events at the U.S. Capitol, it holds special significance as this week draws to a close.
￼     I didn’t think it would happen here.  The divisiveness, the resentment, the suspicion, the anger that pervades so many countries seemed foreign to the people I had met during my campaigns only a decade or so ago. What impressed me most about my fellow Americans was the optimism, the sense of purpose and the willingness to help one another. The Great Recession had not made us bitter; it seemed to have made us more determined to pull together and cheer each other on.  Something happened to change that — not for everyone, of course, but for what has become a larger and larger portion of us. Following the recession, we looked around to see who was to blame for the misfortune we had experienced. Politicians and the media were quick to point the finger — bankers and Wall Street-types: “They should go to jail.” “Washington had ‘bailed out’ the guilty.""  It was not lost on people vying for our attention that stoking anger enhanced their prospects. The same was known to be true from the beginning of history: appealing to resentment and our more base inclinations could always attract a crowd. The founders took every step they could devise to protect the republic from so-called demagogues; their efforts worked for over 200 years. Several developments have combined to threaten that success.  Institutions that enhance mutual understanding are declining. Americans are less likely to go to church where they interact with people from different races and backgrounds. Social endeavors like the Boy and Girl Scouts are waning. Even face-to-face interaction has become less frequent as we and our children disappear into our cellphones — a trend felt even more acutely because of the ongoing pandemic.  Media, embodied by the likes of Walter Cronkite, once provided information trusted by almost all of us. Newspapers, once admired for their comprehensive and accurate coverage, are closing down. Now our information is curated by apps and crafted by radio and cable networks that appeal to our prejudices. Increasingly, the most successful media personalities rile their target base.  Most disappointing of all, too many political figures have stoked these divisions. Demagogues on the left scapegoat the rich; demagogues on the right scapegoat the immigrant. They each scapegoat the other. Politicians’ language is more vulgar, bullying and offensive. Reagan, Eisenhower and Kennedy would not recognize today’s political discourse.  My reading of history suggests what can heal social sickness. First, a great leader who “calls upon our better angels” can bring us together. Churchill rallied his nation to resist and defeat Nazism. Roosevelt elicited the endurance that overcame despair. Lincoln healed a nation torn apart by war, insisting on “malice toward none and charity for all.” I do not believe one can overstate the impact the leader of a nation can have for good or for bad. I earnestly pray that our president can rise to the challenge.  Who we choose to lead us shapes our society. I believe that it is our national character that made America the greatest nation on earth, that the public personal character of leaders like Washington, Lincoln, Reagan and Truman had more influence on us than even the policies they promoted. Today when I vote, I pay as much attention to the character of the candidate as I do to their policies. If we choose leaders who inflame resentment and division, our nation will be angry and divided. We have a choice to make: Would we rather have our “side” win to punish the “other side” or would we rather have our nation united?  But presidents and politicians are not the only leaders who influence society. Leaders of churches, congregations, classrooms, businesses, charities and homes can influence the character of the nation. When each of us encourages comity, understanding and grace, we heal. When we disparage, bully or treat others with contempt, we deepen the rift that divides us.  I believe that we should watch and read, not just sources we tend to agree with but also sources we disagree with. If Fox is your regular diet, watch NBC, CNN or ABC now and then. Conversely, if MSNBC is your regular, don’t make it exclusive. We need to broaden our reading as well. I note that news organizations like The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times make an effort to get the facts and when they make a mistake, they acknowledge it. Social media has no fact-checkers, no editors and often doesn’t even disclose who actually wrote a post.  I pray for the healing of the nation. Literally. I wish there were more faith in God, more reverence for all of his children. A brilliant leader of a respected think tank in Washington has concluded that love is the only sure answer to what ails us. I think he’s right.

￼
This week, America watched as a group of lawless thugs stormed the Capitol, incited violence, and attacked our democracy and our American ideals. Their actions were disgraceful and un-American - that is not what our country stands for. Everyone has a right to peacefully protest. No one has a right to commit violence, and those responsible for this heinous attack must be arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.  
The Electoral College has spoken, the President has committed to an orderly transition and that process is underway. Senator Scott is urging the President to reconsider his decision to skip the inauguration, which is an important tradition that demonstrates the peaceful transfer of power to our people and to the world. It’s time to move our nation forward. 
See more of what Senator Scott has been up to this week below.

Sen. Rick Scott Asks President Trump to Reconsider Skipping the Inauguration 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following President Trump’s decision not to attend the inauguration of President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris.   Senator Rick Scott said, “I am urging the President to reconsider his decision to skip the inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. He is, of course, not constitutionally required to attend and I can imagine losing an election is very hard, but I believe he should attend. I plan to attend and believe it is an important tradition that demonstrates the peaceful transfer of power to our people and to the world.” Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott Calls for Investigation into Vaccine Distribution Mismanagement 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement calling for accountability following reports that MorseLife Health System, a nursing home and assisted-living facility in West Palm Beach, Fla., offered vaccines intended for residents to members of the board and major donors.   Senator Rick Scott said, “I applaud the Administration’s tireless efforts to develop the vaccines and quickly distribute millions of doses to our states. Right now, the priority is getting these vaccines out to those that need it most. The first priority is our seniors and vulnerable population, and our healthcare and frontline workers. It is absolutely disgusting and immoral that anyone would take vaccines intended for nursing home residents to distribute them to their friends. This type of gross mismanagement will not be tolerated, and those responsible must be held accountable. We have to do everything possible to get this vaccine out in an efficient and fair manner, and I am calling for a full Congressional investigation into reports of improper vaccine distribution."" Read more HERE.

El Senador Rick Scott pide una investigación sobre el mal manejo de la distribución de vacunas 
El Senador Rick Scott hizo la siguiente declaración pidiendo una investigación luego de informes de que MorseLife Health System en West Palm Beach, Florida, ofreciera vacunas destinadas para sus residentes a miembros de su junta de directores y donantes.   El Senador Rick Scott dijo: “Aplaudo los esfuerzos de la Administración para desarrollar la vacuna y distribuir de manera rápida millones de dosis a los estados. En este momento, la prioridad es hacer llegar estas vacunas a quienes más las necesitan. La primera prioridad son las personas mayores y de poblaciones vulnerables, y nuestros trabajadores de la salud y emergencia. Es absolutamente repugnante e inmoral que alguien tome vacunas destinadas a los residentes de un hogar de ancianos para distribuirlas entre sus amigos. Este tipo de mala administración no será tolerada y los responsables deben rendir cuentas. Tenemos que hacer todo lo posible para que esta vacuna salga de una manera eficiente y justa, y pido que el Congreso lleve a cabo una investigación sobre los informes de distribución inadecuada de vacunas”.  Lea más AQUÍ.

Sen. Rick Scott Requests Additional Information on Florida’s Vaccine Distribution Plans 
Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to Florida Department of Health Secretary and State Surgeon General Scott A. Rivkees, M.D. requesting additional information on the State of Florida’s plans to distribute the COVID-19 vaccine to Floridians as safely and efficiently as possible. By the end of next week, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services will have delivered more than 20 million doses of vaccines to states, with Florida being allocated 1.47 million doses.

Sen. Rick Scott Fights to Defend Free and Fair Elections 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement ahead of Congress’ electoral college vote count.   Senator Rick Scott said, “I’ve thought long and hard about the question before the U.S. Congress today. I’ve heard from constituents across Florida and across the country and I’ve listened to their concerns about the way this election was carried out. I share many of their concerns.  
“During today’s proceedings, I will listen to any and all objections that are raised. I will pay careful attention to the evidence and arguments presented by both sides.   ""The situation in Pennsylvania is of particular concern to me, and I will likely vote to sustain the objection to their slate of electors. The actions of the Governor’s Administration and the courts in Pennsylvania pose a serious threat to the integrity of future elections. The Democrat Governor of Pennsylvania, along with state courts, made a decision to allow votes to be counted that came in after election day, even if they did not have a postmark, in defiance of state law. This is absurd, and cannot be tolerated. It also appears that Pennsylvania enacted policies in direct conflict with its own state constitution, which is also unacceptable. We simply cannot tolerate partisan political attempts to change the rules and tip the scales in our elections. In October, Supreme Court Justices Alito, Gorsuch and Thomas warned that the reckless actions of Pennsylvania’s Governor and Secretary of State might result in ‘serious post-election problems’ and they were right. Both of these matters are still pending at the United States Supreme Court and it would be prudent for Congress to object to Pennsylvania’s electors until these important constitutional questions are resolved.   ""Democrats who are arguing that Republicans fighting to protect the integrity of every vote are a threat to democracy are the same people who tried to overturn the election of Donald Trump every day since he was sworn into office after winning legitimately in 2016. Democrat efforts to impeach President Trump – aided by their allies in the media – were a political coup attempt, an illegitimate effort to remove a president from office because Democrats didn’t like the result of the election.   “In September, I introduced the VOTER Act, which would address systemic problems in voting systems across the country and rebuild trust in our electoral process. It would mandate Voter ID in every state, institute measures to ensure timely results and create uniform national standards for voting by mail. I believe it is a strong path forward to prevent a repeat of the 2020 election and I will be reintroducing this bill at the earliest opportunity.” Read more HERE.

Rick Scott said the alleged actions of a Florida nursing home to distribute vaccines to wealthy donors instead of elderly residents is ‘absolutely disgusting,’ and called for a congressional investigation.    'It is absolutely disgusting and immoral that anyone would take vaccines intended for nursing homes to distribute them to their friends,’ the Florida Republican wrote on Twitter. ‘I am calling for a full Congressional investigation into reports of improper vaccine distribution by MorseLife Health System.'   … According to first-hand accounts published by The Washington Post, MorseLife offered vaccines allocated by the federal government not only to its residents and staff but also to board members and those who had made generous donations to the facility, including members of Palm Beach Country Club. Some reportedly accepted the offer…""

1/8/21 19:20,A dark day in American history,"￼ 
Friends, 
This week, we tragically learned what happens when a President falsely claims an election was stolen and incites his supporters to act on his lies. On Wednesday, January 6th, as Congress gathered to honor our constitutional duty to certify President-elect Biden’s 306 electoral votes, an angry mob of insurrectionists stormed the U.S. Capitol in a violent effort to overthrow our democracy.
Unfortunately, this time-honored process had already been disrupted by several of my Republican colleagues, who would rather spread lies on behalf of a would-be dictator than uphold their oath to the Constitution and stand up for truth, democracy and the rule of law.
I am grateful to the Capitol Police who bravely defended Congress and our Constitution. I pray for the family, friends and colleagues of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, a native New Jerseyan and former staff sergeant in the New Jersey Air National Guard, who died of injuries sustained in this act of domestic terrorism—as well as the four others who lost their lives.
It was, above all else, a very sad day for our country, which for centuries has inspired other nations to embrace freedom, democracy, and the rule of law. With the runoffs in Georgia now behind us and a new Democratic Majority set to lead the Senate, I am hopeful that, as Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I can do my part to help restore American values and ensure we remain that shining beacon of hope to those in the darkest corners of the world.
Accepting losses at the ballot box is never easy—but it is the American way. Should Americans lose their faith in the integrity of our elections, from the White House down to the school board, I fear we may soon be left with nothing but the shadow of a once great Republic. We must not let that happen.
January 6, 2021 will be remembered as a dark day in American history. But our democracy prevailed. Once the Capitol was secured, the House and Senate reconvened and certified that, come January 20th, President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will be sworn into office in a peaceful transfer of power. 
As always, it is a privilege to represent New Jersey in the United States Senate. We must now get back to the work of defeating this pandemic, rebuilding our economy, and restoring the fabric of our democracy. Together, we will heal our divided nation.      Kind regards,  
￼  U.S. Senator Bob Menendez

1/8/21 19:10,A Trying Week For Democracy,"￼

January 8, 2021
 
Dear Lindsey,
 
 
This was an incredibly challenging, emotional, and painful week for our nation.
 
As Congress headed back into session for the first time in the new year, we faced a simple task: to certify the votes of the Electoral College—as has been done after every presidential election in U.S. history—and formally declare Joe Biden and Kamala Harris the President and Vice President-Elect. Instead, our work was disrupted by a violent crowd of rioters storming the Capitol, incited by our very own president, Donald Trump. 
 
Thankfully, my colleagues and I remained safe while sheltering in place in an undisclosed location. But my heart is broken by the insurrection that erupted around us and the desecration of a building that is the very manifestation of our democracy—a sacred space that represents the rule of law, the voice of the people, and the fundamental values we hold dear. This violence is simply not who we are as Americans, and it must stop.
 
It’s abundantly clear that Donald Trump’s actions and rhetoric make him unfit for the office of the presidency. Not only do they merit his impeachment—which I will be co-sponsoring in the House of Representatives—but I fully support invoking the 25th amendment to remove the clear and present danger that he presents to our nation.  
 
Ultimately, the President must be held accountable for his actions. That is why, in addition, I’m urging the Justice Department to begin an investigation immediately into crimes of sedition and treason. Donald Trump must be tried as a private citizen without the shield of the presidency to prevent him from bearing the full consequences of his actions.
 
Through all of this, one thing remains clear: our democracy is strong. It may bend, but it will not break. As we begin a new chapter and look towards the inauguration of President-Elect Biden, we must find it within ourselves to unite, to heal, and to move forward as one nation.
 
Godspeed,
 
Joe Morelle

117th U.S. Congress begins. Sunday, for a seventh time, I took the oath of office to serve as representative of the people of the Mariana Islands in the U.S. Congress. After being re-elected as Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi (D-California) swore in the members in small groups to stick with pandemic protocols. The most important work for the 117th U.S. Congress will be to help everyone living in our country get beyond the crisis caused by COVID. I look forward to using everything I have learned over the last twelve years to recover our economy and to make sure the people of the Marianas stay healthy. 
 
 

Terrorists hit Capitol

Our Constitution guarantees us all the right of free speech and peaceful protest. But no one has the right to destroy our federal buildings or impede the work of Congress. Yet that is what happened Wednesday in what can only be called terrorism by a mob, instigated by President Trump to go to the U.S. Capitol to stop the certification of the election results. 
 
I walked through the crowd outside to go home for lunch, while both chambers debated the Arizona objection, never imagining what would happen minutes later. The Trump supporters turned ugly, defied the police, smashed windows, broke into offices, and crashed through to the House and Senate chambers, even stealing documents and furnishings as souvenirs of their insurrection. Four of the rioters sadly died; and several U.S. Capitol Police officers were injured in the assault, including Officer Brian Sicknick, who sadly passed away the next day.

No sooner did I get to my apartment, when the building was evacuated because a pipe bomb was discovered in the alleyway outside. I waited out on the street in the cold for four hours until the bomb was “disrupted,” as the bomb squad said. The Capitol Police offered to take me to a safe location, but I declined.

By that night the rioters, having no real purpose, drifted away or were pushed out of the Capitol and off the grounds by the police. And Congress completed the work of certifying that Joe Biden won the Presidential election.
 
I want to thank everyone who got in touch to ask if I was safe. I am so very grateful for your concern. The Marianas congressional office staff are safe, as am I and all the other Members of Congress. I think I can speak for all, when I say we will not be bullied or intimidated. We swore an oath on Sunday to defend the Constitution from all enemies—foreign and domestic—and to work for our people. With God’s help, that is what we will continue to do. 
 

DC statehood cosponsorship

Our Constitution, also, guarantees equal treatment under law, a promise that remains incompletely fulfilled. On Monday, I became an original cosponsor of the D.C. statehood bill, one way we can give the people living in Washington, D.C. more equal treatment. In the last Congress, the House passed H.R. 51, providing statehood, but the Republican-led Senate took no action. With a record-breaking 202 original cosponsors, when the bill was introduced in this Congress, I look forward to quick action in the House. And with a Democratic Senate after Tuesday’s elections in Georgia, I am hopeful the U.S. citizens of Washington, D.C. may finally gain their full political rights.
 

Defense Act with NMI bills now law

Legislation to help Marianas small business, increase student STEM participation and opportunities for military spouses, and make the AMBER Alert program effective in the U.S. insular areas all became law on Saturday. I authored the four bills, H.R. 6021, H.R. 6786, H.R. 7712, H.R. 4614, and then included them in the National Defense Authorization Act, when the House passed it in July. Although the President vetoed the Act, both the House and the Senate overrode his veto; and the NDAA is now law. As a result, the Marianas is eligible for funding to establish a Lead Small Business Development Center. Marianas small businesses will have access to federal seed funding. Our islands are included in the STARBASE program, which aims to improve students’ skills in science, technology, engineering, and math. Military spouses will get more financial aid to get the training they may need to re-license in their profession or finish their college degrees. And the Marianas is included in the national AMBER Alert program to find missing children. Read more on my new laws here. 
 
 

Medicare handbook now available. The Medicare & You 2021 handbook is now available for pickup at your congressional district offices in Saipan, Tinian, and Rota. This handbook contains everything you need to know about your Medicare coverage, including information on changes to Medicare this year. You can also access an electronic version of the handbook here. 
 

More money for vets cemeteries 
  
Legislation I introduced, increasing federal maintenance funds available for the veterans cemetery in Marpi and nationwide, was signed into law by the President Tuesday. My bill, the Veterans Cemetery Grants Improvement Act, H.R. 5487, doubles the current limit of $5 million for cemetery maintenance grants. I added it to H.R. 7105, an omnibus package of programs and benefits for homeless veterans during the COVID-19 public health emergency. Increased funding for the Marpi cemetery should help the Commonwealth government keep our Marianas veterans’ final resting place clean and beautiful. 
 

PPP reopens

A new round of Paycheck Protection Program funding provided by Congress will be available beginning January 11, 2021 according to the U.S. Small Business Administration. In its announcement Friday, SBA said initially only community and minority financial institutions, such as the Bank of Guam, will be able to make First Draw PPP Loans on Monday, January 11, Second Draw PPP Loans on Wednesday, January 13 and then open to all participating lenders afterward. Congress made a number of updates to the program including allowing certain existing PPP borrowers to apply for a second PPP loan, extending eligibility to more non-profit organizations, greater flexibility for seasonal employees, and authorizing funds to cover additional expenses. Read more on the changes in SBA’s guidance here.

2020 The Year in Review

We had no idea when 2020 began that it would become so historically significant. From the pandemic, which swept our nation, to the denial of a second term for the President, 2020 will live in memory. In our traditional year in review, we look at the congressional highlights of each month for our readers: 

January

HUD agrees CDBG-DR assistance

Following up on my request to Secretary Ben Carson and meeting with the Housing and Urban Development officials in charge of the CDBG-DR program last month, the Department has outlined their plans to help the Commonwealth meet requirements for the $244 million Congress made available for Marianas disaster recovery. I asked that HUD provide technical assistance so the money is put to work quickly and with firm financial and procurement controls. HUD will make two on-site visits to the Marianas within 90 days of the Federal Register notice of allocation to help with financial certification and action plan preparations. Training on the CDBG-DR Grant Reporting system and financial management requirements will be held within 120 days of the notice. And, in addition to assistance from agency staff, HUD will also cover costs for a technical assistance consultant. The $244 million CDBG-DR Grant award is the largest federal grant to the Marianas. 

February

More funds to secure NMI elections

The Commonwealth is receiving $600,000 from the Election Assistance Commission under the Help America Vote Act. We included the money in the Consolidated Appropriations Act enacted on December 20. No local match is required. The new funds are intended to improve security, so voters can have confidence in the integrity of elections. The Commonwealth Election Commission plans to upgrade voting equipment, conduct election auditing activities, enhance the voter registration system and management, strengthen cyber-security, and better track campaign financing.

March

Paid leave, more Medicaid, food aid

Workers in the Marianas will get paid sick leave for themselves or to care for a family member, including children at home because of school closures. The Commonwealth will receive more Medicaid money to treat the ill. And more food aid will be available to help Marianas households that lose income due to lay-offs or hours reduction. These benefits are all included in the Families First Coronavirus Response Act signed by the President on Wednesday. The Families First Act also makes coronavirus testing free for anyone, with or without insurance. 

April

Marianas gets CARES Act aid

The $2.2 trillion CARES Act and the two preceding coronavirus relief laws are providing a vast range of benefits to the Marianas. Having worked to make sure the Marianas is eligible, now we want to make sure you know what those benefits are -- and how to get them: 
	•	$1,200 tax rebates, $500 per child
	•	$945 weekly unemployment 
	•	$22.4 million for PSS
	•	$4.7 million for Northern Marianas College
	•	Grants, loans to business to keep paying workers
	•	Cash for NMC students
	•	$36.3 million for the CNMI government
	•	$3.3 million to provide child care
	•	$470,000 to Joeten-Kiyu library
	•	$243,000 to thee Humanities Council
	•	$22.76 million for airports
	•	United gets help, must keep flying
	•	$1.5 million for dislocated workers

May

Asylum bar regs updated

The U.S. Workforce Act , my legislation extending the CW program for ten years and increasing protections and training for U.S. workers, also extended the bar on claims of asylum in the Marianas. On April 30, the U.S. Department of Justice issued a final rule to amend its regulations to reflect the asylum extension through 2030. The bar on claims of asylum was an original part of the Consolidated Natural Resources Act, Public Law 110-229, that transitioned immigration from the Commonwealth to the federal government. The bar allowed the federal government to open the Marianas to tourists from China, who, before the coronavirus crisis, had grown to 40 percent of our tourism economy. So, the ten-year extension was a key goal in negotiation, when we wrote the U.S. Workforce Act. 
 

Thanks to frontline workers. Thanks to all who are making the thousands of meals being distributed daily for children at the Grab-n-Go Meal sites. With schools closed, students who depend on the PSS Child Nutrition Program would not get that food, otherwise. I lent a hand at the Marianas High School distribution point on Thursday. I am so grateful to everyone at PSS and to all the food vendor staff who are putting their own health at risk to make sure children have healthy meals. Thank you for this vital service. 

June

PPP Flexibility Act now law

Small businesses in the Marianas will have greater flexibility in the use of their CARES Act Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) funds under legislation passed by Congress and signed into law Friday. H.R. 7010 , the PPP Flexibility Act, allows forgiveness of expenses beyond the original 8-week period to 24 weeks while extending loan terms from two to five years. The bill also increases the current limitation on non-payroll expenses (such as rent, utility payments and mortgage interest) for loan forgiveness from 25 to 40 percent. Borrowers will have until the end of this year to rehire employees while also having full access to payroll tax deferment. 

July
 

Oversight: FEMA’s typhoon response

As Vice Chair for Insular Affairs, I led the Committee on Natural Resources virtual forum Wednesday on the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s response to Pacific Natural Disasters in 2018. Democratic Representatives Ed Case of Hawaii, Michael San Nicolas of Guam, Darren Soto of Florida, and I questioned Christopher Currie of the Government Accountability Office on GAO’s preliminary findings on the federal response to Super Typhoons Yutu and Mangkhut, which struck the Northern Marianas and Guam, and Hurricane Lane and the Mount Kilauea eruptions in Hawai’i. We required the review by GAO in the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Act, 2019 to ensure federal funds were spent effectively and are fully accounted for. FEMA obligated about $788 million in disaster assistance, as of May 2020, to the Marianas, Guam, and Hawaii for response and recovery efforts following the 2018 disasters, of which $593 million went to the Marianas. The forum can be viewed on YouTube here . 

August

Conservation, park funds now law

The annual Land and Water Conservation Fund grant to the Marianas is now permanently increased. President Trump signed the Great American Outdoors Act into law on Tuesday setting aside $900 million in offshore oil and gas revenues each year to Fund. That will mean about $1.6 million for the Marianas each year to safeguard natural areas or plan, develop, and maintain public outdoor recreation projects. Our annual grant increased from $75,000, on average, to $1,634,057 million this year with passage of the John J. Dingell Jr. Conservation, Management and Recreation Act. The Dingell Act gives each of the five insular areas a full state-share of LWCF funding.  

Veterans bill becomes law

Veterans and their eligible family members will now be able to use their GI Bill educational benefits to cover the cost of preparatory courses for license and certification exams. The legislation I introduced as H.R. 2934, which was added to the Ryan Kules and Paul Benne Special Adaptive Housing Improvement Act of 2019, was signed into law by the President on Saturday. H.R. 2934 allows the Veterans Administration to pay the fees for courses that prepare students for license and certification tests. Northern Marianas College, for instance, has offered a $400 course to help prepare for the NCLEX nurse licensing exam. Latte Training Academy offers CompTIA certification exam courses for those entering IT professions. The new law allows the GI bill to cover those costs. Before, only the test fees themselves were covered by the GI Bill. Making more benefits available to returning service members and their families has been a key goal in my service on the House Veterans Affairs Committee. Up to 30 percent of Marianas high school graduates enter the military each year, according to the Public School System. 

September

$17.5m for water/sewer

Marianas water and sewer infrastructure gets another $17,519,000, the Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday. $10,400,000 is the specific set-aside for the Marianas I included in last year’s disaster relief act, U.S. Public Law 116-20. The balance of $7,191,000 is the set aside for the Marianas and other territories in the EPA appropriation for fiscal year 2020, U.S. Public Law 116-94. The money is more welcome than ever with so much of our attention on the need to raise standards for public health and maintain a clean environment for residents and to reassure prospective tourists that the Marianas is safe to visit. We increased water and sewer funding every year since 2010 by changing a formula in annual appropriations bills. Together with one-time funding in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act total funding has now reached $97.6 million. In July, I successfully offered a floor amendment to H.R. 2, the Moving Forward Act, making a permanent formula change. The House passed the bill, 233-188, but the Republican-led Senate has refused to take action. 

October

$12-16M for Marianas food aid

The Marianas will have an additional $12 to $16 million in food aid for families with school-age children thanks to legislation enacted this week. The continuing resolution with the new Pandemic EBT funding was signed into law on Thursday. Democratic leadership extended Pandemic EBT to the Marianas after the U.S. Food and Nutrition Services informed me on September 14—and I informed Speaker Nancy Pelosi—that the Marianas Nutrition Assistance Program would run out of money sometime next year. 

November

More Medicaid lowered referrals

$120 million in Marianas-specific funding in U.S. Public Law 116-94 and another $36 million in USPL 116-20 has enabled the Commonwealth to provide Medicaid insurance to more residents and significantly lowered the need for off-island referrals for specialty treatment. According to the Commonwealth Medicaid Agency’s 2020 report to Congress, issued last week, the increased Congressional funding for Medicaid has enabled the Commonwealth Healthcare Corporation to hire an orthopedic surgeon and otolaryngologist and establish an oncology center. Patients previously had to travel off-island for treatment in these specialties, which is expensive and burdensome for the patient. Now, off-island referrals for these specialties are down 80 percent, 90 percent, and 95 percent respectively. Continuing these elevated levels of Medicaid funding will be an important goal in the coming, 117th Congress, beginning in January. 

December
 

Marianas benefits in COVID relief

Individuals, businesses, schools, and healthcare in the Marianas will all benefit from the $908 billion COVID relief legislation Congress passed Monday, if President Trump signs the bill. COVID relief was attached to an omnibus appropriation for fiscal year 2021, which also has important funding for the Marianas. This was the third time the House has passed COVID relief to continue programs begun by the CARES Act in March. The House passed its relief plan, the HEROES Act, in May and again in October; but the Republican-led Senate was unwilling to act. This attitude changed after the presidential election and as coronavirus deaths rose. Negotiations quickened last week. Multiple virtual Democratic Caucus meetings to discuss those negotiations gave me the opportunity to press Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Appropriations Chair Nita Lowey to include the Marianas in all national programs and also make special provisions for the Marianas. Some of the important elements of the 5,593 page Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 include: 
	•	$14m in Marianas food aid;
	•	$90m Community Disaster Loan allowed;
	•	Unemployment extended; CWs qualify;
	•	$284 billion for first and second forgivable Paycheck Protection Program loans;
	•	Marianas public kindergarten through high schools will receive about $68.7 million, keeping teachers and staff paid; 
	•	Pell grants for college students increase to a maximum of $5,435; and
	•	My Simple FAFSA Act was incorporated in the relief bill making it easier for students to apply for federal aid.

1/8/21 18:39,2021: A crucial time for our democracy,"Having trouble viewing this email? View it as a Web page.
￼
January 8, 2021
Dear friend,
The events that unfolded this week in Washington, D.C. mark a dark and heartbreaking chapter in American history.
On January 6th, our constitutional role as members of Congress was to certify Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' victory. Our role wasn't to change election results or entertain false claims of widespread voter fraud on the House and Senate floors.
As this process was taking place, a mob of rioters sought to directly interfere with our democracy. They were incited and encouraged by the president's lies and conspiracies surrounding the election. In total, five people lost their lives due to this insurrection, including a Capitol Police officer. 
This was a sad and humiliating day for Americans here at home and on the world stage. Countries around the world look to us as a model of a stable government fortified by a peaceful transfer of power. They did not recognize the United States of America as they watched the violence escalate inside and outside the U.S. Capitol.
Our democracy has survived many assaults in the past, and this event was no different. Our institutions and democratic traditions were put to the test this week. They proved their strength once again, but it’s clear that the president is a grave threat to this nation. The Vice President and cabinet should invoke the 25th Amendment to immediately remove President Trump from office. It’s time for the members of this administration who’ve enabled the president to stop the destruction they’ve helped cause.
I want to thank my constituents for their concern during these past few days. I stand with my fellow members of Congress and assure you that we will not be intimidated as we continue to defend our democracy. It's an honor to serve you. Let's get to work.

Information on vaccine administration in San Diego
The county is following state and federal guidelines as vaccines are being given in phases based on priority groups. To determine the groups, the county is working with the community through its COVID-19 Vaccine Clinical Advisory Group. 
Click here for more on the clinical advisory group, COVID-19 vaccine phases, details on the authorized Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines and important information for healthcare professionals.
Vaccines give us hope in the fight against COVID-19, but cases continue rising and ICUs in Southern California are reaching capacity. Please continue to wash your hands frequently, wear a mask and practice social distance. Everyone's health and well-being depend on our willingness to do our part.

Deadline extension: California Small Business COVID-19 Relief Grant Program 
To support our state's small business sector during this pandemic, the deadline for relief through a state-run grant program is extended until next Wednesday, January 13th. The amount of grant funding ranges from $5,000 to $25,000 and businesses are eligible based on their annual revenue as documented in their most recent tax return. You can apply for relief here.
Reopening of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)
The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) announced that the Paycheck Protection Program will re-open the week of January 11 for new borrowers and certain existing PPP borrowers.
This round of the PPP continues to prioritize millions of Americans employed by small businesses by authorizing up to $284 billion toward job retention and other expenses through March 31, 2021, and by allowing certain existing PPP borrowers to apply for a second draw PPP Loan. For more information on SBA’s assistance to small businesses, visit sba.gov/ppp or treasury.gov/cares.

He holds the rule of law above all else and will restore faith in the justice system. Judge Garland will reinstate disciplined leadership at the Department of Justice and will set the tone for how justice will be delivered under the Biden-Harris Administration. I am confident that he will enforce our laws in the interest of the American people, not as the personal lawyer for the President. I look forward to working with Judge Garland in his role as U.S. Attorney General after his confirmation in the Senate.""

Until then, I urge the good men and women honorably serving at all levels of the federal government to please stay at their post for the protection of our democracy. The actions of a rogue President will not and should not reflect on you. Instead, your patriotism and commitment to the greater good of our country will be reaffirmed.""

While the vaccine is a safe, effective way to protect ourselves from COVID-19, I will continue to follow the recommendations from the CDC by wearing a mask and practicing social distancing to keep myself and others as safe as possible. I encourage all West Virginians to receive the vaccine as it becomes available to protect themselves and others from this virus."" 
JANUARY 06, 2021:  BIPARTISAN, BICAMERAL GROUP ISSUES STATEMENT ON CAPITOL INSURGENCE  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), Susan Collins (R-ME), Mark Warner (D-VA), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Angus King (I-ME), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), and Dick Durbin (D-IL) and Problem Solvers Caucus Co-Chairs Representatives Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ-5) and Tom Reed (R-NY-23) released the following statement on the United States Capitol insurgence today.  ""The behavior we witnessed in the U.S. Capitol is entirely un-American. This was not a peaceful protest – this was an insurrection. These individuals should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. The American people can rest assured that we will finish our work, certify the results of the 2020 election, and ensure a peaceful transition of power. Our democracy is stronger than the destructive behavior of any mob and will survive today’s egregious behavior."" 
JANUARY 06, 2021: MANCHIN STATEMENT ON THE DEATH OF MIKE MYER  Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) today released the following statement on the death of Mike Myer, longtime Executive Editor of The Intelligencer and Wheeling News-Register.  ""Mike was a person of the upmost integrity. Over the years, we had lively debates about politics and the best direction for West Virginia. Mike was always able to look for the common ground and the best way to move forward for the sake of our state and country. I appreciate his insight and friendship more than he knew. I will miss him a great deal. Gayle and I are praying for his family and friends as they mourn this tremendous loss.""

With tight margins in the House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans are faced with a decision to either work together to put the priorities of our nation before partisan politics or double down on the dysfunctional tribalism.   ""For the sake of the country we all love, we must commit to solving the serious problems facing our nation. With respect to the Senate, we must return to regular order. I am hopeful that we will set an agenda that invites vigorous and respectful debate on the issues that matter. Above all, we must avoid the extreme and polarizing rhetoric that only further divides the American people - I will work tirelessly to make sure we do. It is time for Americans to move closer together.   ""To ensure we achieve this new era of bipartisanship let us all commit to restoring decency and civility to our politics, and becoming the example of governing the American people deserve and the world expects."" 
JANUARY 06, 2021: VA INFORMS MANCHIN REPORT ON PATIENT SAFETY AND QUALITY OF CARE WILL NOT BE DELIVERED   Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) received notification that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will miss the congressionally mandated deadline to submit a report on patient safety and quality of care at VA Medical Centers (VAMC), leaving Veterans and their loved ones without information on the policies and procedures in place across the VA. Senator Manchin’s legislation, The Improving Safety and Security for Veterans Act of 2019, was introduced in response to the murders at the Clarksburg VAMC and was signed into law in December 2020. The law requires the VA to produce a report on patient safety and quality of care at VA Medical Centers (VAMCs) 30 days after the legislation was signed into law.

BROADBAND

The sad fact is that many places in West Virginia simply do not have access to reliable broadband and the lack of access affects West Virginians every day. Back in 2015, the FCC released a coverage map that stated 99.9% of Americans had wireless coverage. I knew then what I know now: That is just plain wrong.

1/8/21 18:29,This Is Not Who We Are,"￼ 


 Dear West Virginian,  You’ve seen the photos on the news. You’ve watched the videos on social media. On Wednesday, while Congress tried to certify the results of the Electoral College, the United States Capitol was attacked and vandalized by rioters. Several people were injured. Others were killed, including a Capitol Police officer. This is not law and order.  Thankfully, my staff and I are safe, but days later, my heart is still heavy. Wednesday’s insurrection looked like something you’d see in Venezuela or Beirut. This is the United States of America. This is not who we are.  I spoke more about my experience on Talkline with Hoppy Kercheval.   Our democracy permits enjoying electoral victories, but its survival requires accepting defeats. (Despite a landslide victory in West Virginia, President Trump lost his re-election bid. I voted for President Trump in the presidential election, and I wanted him to be re-elected. As a United States Senator, I supported many of his policies over the past four years, and I will continue to advocate for these on behalf of West Virginia—even with a new administration.)  I recognize this is not what most West Virginians wanted. It’s not what I wanted. But the Constitution is clear: Congress does not have the authority to reject electors chosen by the states. States are in charge of their own elections. My full thoughts on the vote to certify the Electoral College can be found here.  In days, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be sworn in as President and Vice President of the United States. No attack on our United States Capitol was ever going to change that.  I know that not all of the protesters that day were violent. I know that there were many that were peacefully exercising their First Amendment right. However, this mob mentality causes permanent damage to our republic. We saw it this summer across the country as rioters burned cities and vandalized businesses. We saw it this week at the Capitol. Both are wrong.   These are tense times. Families are struggling financially. The COVID-19 pandemic continues taking lives. I ask that you please join me in praying for our country as we enter this new administration. Pray for unity. Pray for peace.  Additional COVID-19 Resources  I created a page on my website with information and resources to keep you up-to-date on the coronavirus situation as it continues to evolve. For example, checks and debit cards are on the way to those eligible as a result of the relief package we passed a few weeks ago. Check out that page here, and please share with friends so they can keep up with the latest.  In addition to my webpage, I also want to make sure you know where to get the latest updates from the medical experts at CDC.gov and West Virginia DHHR.   I will continue doing my best to keep you up to speed on what we are doing here at the federal level to help and other resources that can be useful back at home. I will be posting regular updates on my Facebook and Twitter accounts, so be sure to follow me there.  Important Information If You’re Visiting DC  Because of coronavirus concerns, all Capitol and White House tours have been suspended indefinitely. Please contact our Washington office to reschedule. Additionally, requests for flags flown over the Capitol may be delayed, and access to the Capitol and House and Senate office buildings is being restricted. Feel free to contact our office at (202) 224-6472 with any questions. We apologize for any inconvenience.  How Can We Help?  Whether you need help with a casework issue or have a question about scheduling a meeting at one of my offices, my staff and I are ready to assist you. Learn more about the services we offer at www.capito.senate.gov.  You can also submit your feedback and share your stories with me by visiting my “Share Your Stories” webpage here: www.capito.senate.gov/ShareYourStories.  Social Media Recap

1/8/21 18:28,Democracy Wins,"￼

January 8th, 2021
  
Dear Friend,
 
This Wednesday was a dark day in the history of our nation. As Democrats and Republicans worked to fulfill our constitutional duty to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election, a violent mob, incited by President Donald Trump and his allies, breached the United States Capitol in an attack on our democracy and an attempted effort to change the results of a free and fair election. Five people, including one Capitol Police officer, died as a result of this insurrection. This attempt to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power – our nation’s most sacred tradition – is an affront not only to our values as Americans but to our very democracy.
 
Despite these seditious efforts, democracy prevailed, and both the House and the Senate returned after the Capitol was secured to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election.
 
Wednesday’s lawless actions did not have to happen and resulted in countless injuries and five deaths — including that of Brian Sicknick, a 12-year veteran of the U.S. Capitol Police, who died from injuries sustained while physically engaging with pro-Trump rioters storming the Capitol. The President has fanned the flames of violence for months. This is unacceptable, it is un-American, and it has no place in our nation. Those involved in this violent mob should be held to account and be prosecuted. We also need answers – we need to identify the security failures that allowed this to happen so that we can prevent future tragedies and ensure that our seat of government is protected. I want to express my deep appreciation to the United States Capitol Police for their work to protect us, our staff, and the U.S. Capitol. 
  
 
￼
 
  
 
President Trump Must be Removed
 
  
President Trump has proven time and again that he is either unable or unwilling to protect and defend the United States Constitution or the American people. The violence he incited Wednesday undoubtedly played a central role in the insurrection of the U.S. Capitol. Americans and citizens around the world watched in horror as a mob of pro-Trump domestic terrorists invaded and attacked the center of our democracy — the People’s House — aimed at overturning the results of a free and fair election and preventing us from fulfilling our constitutional duty to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election.
 
As long as President Trump is in the Oval Office, the people of this country — and our very democracy — are at risk. This man demonstrates a clear inability to discharge the duties of his office and he should be removed immediately. I hope that Vice President Pence and members of the President’s cabinet will find the courage to do right by our nation and invoke the 25th Amendment to ensure this President cannot cause more irreparable harm in the remaining days of his Presidency. If they will not act, articles of impeachment should be drafted immediately.
  
 
Certifying the 2020 Presidential Election Results
 
  
Just after 3:30 AM on Thursday, the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate fulfilled their constitutionally-mandated duty to certify the results of the 2020 presidential election. I am humbled by and proud of the solemn responsibility to oversee this process in Congress. The peaceful transfer of power is a pillar and sacred hallmark of America’s democracy, and the violent events that took place Wednesday at the United States Capitol underscore the necessity to uphold this tradition. The American people have spoken and have lawfully elected Joe Biden and Kamala Harris as our next president and vice-president. We cannot and will not allow violence or intimidation to undermine the rule of law and the will of the American people.
  
 
The Beginning of the 117th Congress
 
  
 
￼
 
  
On Sunday, I was honored to be sworn into the 117th Congress to represent New Hampshire’s Second Congressional District. We’re facing incredible challenges in our state and our nation including a deadly pandemic and a struggling economy, which demand immediate and purposeful action. As we look toward this next session of Congress and the priorities of Granite Staters, I am focused on:
	•	Ramping up the production and distribution of the COVID vaccine and supporting the incoming Biden-Harris Administration’s efforts to utilize the Defense Production Act to ensure we can quickly get vaccines administered and move past the pandemic.
	•	Expanding access to affordable health care coverage for Granite Staters and Americans across the country—and with the incoming Biden-Harris Administration, we will have the support and vision from the White House to enact meaningful legislation.
	•	Prioritizing renewable and clean energy to support energy efficiency programs and lower the cost for consumers. With the incoming Biden-Harris Administration, we will be able to create the clean energy economy of the future and set our country up for success for generations to come.
	•	Protecting and expanding access to resources and health care for our veterans, who have sacrificed so much for our country.
	•	Ending the opioid epidemic by increasing access to treatment and support for those with substance use disorder. As the founder and co-chair of the Bipartisan Opioid Task Force, I will work across the aisle to ensure we address the opioid crisis head-on and provide support for those who need it most.
 We have a lot to accomplish to ensure no one is left behind as we recover from this pandemic and to unite our nation to build a better future — but there is more that unites us than divides us. I am so honored to bring the voices of New Hampshire’s Second District to Congress, and I look forward to building back better in the 117th Congress. 
  
 
Protecting Ourselves and Each Other from COVID-19
 
  
Amid the chaos at the Capitol this week, the country is also still struggling with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. On Thursday, the United States had the deadliest day since the pandemic began, with more than 4,000 American deaths as a result of COVID-19.  Sadly, New Hampshire COVID-19 hospitalization rates hit an all-time high last weekend. We must continue taking precautions to keep ourselves and those around us safe and stop the spread of COVID-19. There is a light at the end of the tunnel as safe, effective vaccines begin to be administered in NH and across the country — it’s crucial that we continue wearing our masks, avoiding crowds, and washing our hands frequently. 
  
 
Joining CloseUp on Sunday
 
  
I’ll be on WMUR’s CloseUp this Sunday at 10 a.m. to discuss the events at the Capitol this week, COVID-19, and the status of vaccine distribution.  Watch live on WMUR 9, or on WMUR.com.

Sincerely, 
 
Annie

Week in Review


 
Update on Attack on the U.S. Capitol
 
The brutal attack on our nation this week was an unprecedented threat to our democracy.  We must be clear on what happened: A violent mob stormed our nation’s Capitol and attempted to stop Congress from certifying the Electoral Vote. By repeating disproven claims about election malfeasance, President Trump incited and encouraged this unlawful attack. And in response, he doubled down on those same false claims and issued a half-hearted rebuke.
Thanks to law enforcement, they failed, and we rightfully certified the election of Joe Biden.
The peaceful transition of power is a sacred process, deliberately outlined in the Constitution to ensure the stability of our nation. The importance of this process is far bigger than President Trump, and will not be thwarted by a violent mob.

Strengthening Our Nation’s Cyber Defenses
 
With the NDAA now enacted, I’m pleased to announce eight measures I authored to strengthen our nation’s cyber defenses and expand access to mental healthcare have become law. From schools in Central New York to federal agencies in Washington, we all face significant risks and must do better to prepare for and respond to cyber-attacks. While these measures take important steps to better secure our nation, I recognize there’s much more to be done. As Ranking Member on the House Homeland Security Committee, strengthening our nation’s cybersecurity will be among my top priorities.

Legislative Update: Bill To Rename Fayetteville Post Office In Honor Of Local WWII Veteran Signed Into Law
 
Corporal George H. Bacel had deep roots in our Central New York community and was a beloved WWII veteran, small business owner, and postal worker. To honor his life and legacy, I’m pleased to announce the bill I introduced to designate the Fayetteville Post Office, the ‘Corporal George H. Bacel Memorial Postal Facility,’ has  been signed into law. The passage of this measure marks an important step forward in our pursuit to pay tribute to Corporal Bacel’s contributions to Central New York and this nation. I thank U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Senator Chuck Schumer for their work to advance this legislation through the Senate.

Voting to Certify Election the Presidential Results
Each state conducts its election for President in a different manner, which has led to confusion and misunderstanding among the public. In the past, this system has generally worked. However, this year when the COVID-19 pandemic was added into this mix of 50 different election systems, it demonstrated the need for a more uniform voting process among the states.

In an effort to accommodate voters due to this health care crisis, state election officials, county officials, Governors, and courts circumvented state legislatures and unilaterally modified election procedures contrary to state laws and the U.S. Constitution. They failed to install safeguards to ensure only legitimate votes were counted.

Consequently, I am outraged that these state legislatures abrogated their Constitutional authorities by allowing other officials to rewrite election laws. The legislatures failed to ensure a fair and transparent process that would renew the confidence of the American public. Now they are relying on Congress to step in and mediate.

What authority does Congress have? Having read Article II and the 10th and 12th Amendments to the Constitution, as well as Federalist Paper Number 68, it is clear Congress has no role to object to the states’ election results once they are certified. Therefore, I am compelled to vote against the proposed objections. 
Any problems with the election in these states should have been addressed prior to certification. The proper venue for this dispute is in the state legislatures.

If we believe in states’ rights, we must recognize the Constitution gives the states the power to submit their duly certified electors. We should respect the states’ authority, otherwise we might as well replace the Electoral College with Congress.

As I said weeks ago, the legal and constitutional electoral process needed to be followed to give President Trump a fair hearing and exhaust his legal rights.

Nearly sixty legal cases were heard, but each has been dismissed. In five of the six states in question, Republican legislatures had the power to object and send a different slate of electoral votes to Congress. But, they did not.

So, we are now at the end of the process.

Look, I don’t like the results of this election at all. Like most West Virginians I voted for President Trump and am deeply disappointed at the outcome of the election. I am angry and frustrated at what happened with the states in question. However, that does not mean I can deviate from the limited role laid out by the Constitution.

Protecting the integrity of our elections and maintaining the confidence of American voters is fundamental to the health of our country. Congress and state legislatures must take steps now to address the flaws that have been clearly identified and make sure they can’t happen in the future. The American people deserve peace of mind that national elections are uniform, fair, and transparent. In so doing we can restore confidence in the electoral process.

Start of 117th Congress
This past Sunday was the start of the 117th Congress. It has been the greatest honor to represent West Virginia District 1 for the past 10 years and counting. One important part that has helped me along the way is having a strong partner to lean on. Mary’s been with me every step of the way.
￼


Highlights from 116th Congress
This past year, I was able to secure a number of key energy provisions that were included in the omnibus. The package included the most robust energy policy reforms in more than a decade, including policies to help use coal and natural gas more cleanly and efficiently.
This bipartisan energy package is a major victory for America’s future. By increasing investments in innovative technologies, we will be able to reduce our carbon emissions, lower energy costs, and export new technologies to countries around the globe.
From streamlining permitting of carbon capture projects to increasing efficiency in our turbines, all of these policies will help modernize our energy system. Many of these are bills we have pushed for years. It’s clear our persistence has paid off.
Below is a breakdown of his six energy priorities included: 
	•	The USE IT Act (H.R. 1166), which is a bipartisan, bicameral bill supports the development and demonstration of vital carbon capture and removal technologies by streamlining permitting of CO2 pipelines. McKinley is the lead Republican on the bill with Rep. Scott Peters (D-CA).
	•	The High Efficiency Turbines (H.R. 2659), which requires the Office of Fossil Energy to carry out a research, development, and technology demonstration program to improve the energy efficiency of gas turbines used in electric power generation systems. McKinley has worked with Rep. Paul Tonko (D-NY) on this bill since 2012.
	•	The Fossil Energy Research and Development Act (H.R. 3607) continues to reauthorize research activities in the Department of Energy’s Office of Fossil Energy, which operates the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) in Morgantown. It sets priorities for the next generation of clean energy technologies that will help the energy industry continue to flourish in our country.
	•	The RIVER Act (H.R. 3361) reauthorizes two Department of Energy (DOE) programs that encourages utilizing existing dams for power generation. The RIVER Act passed the House earlier this month.
	•	The Clean Industrial Technology Act (H.R. 4230), which increases innovation to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from industrial sources and make American companies more competitive in the global economy. McKinley is the lead Republican on the bill, which is sponsored by Rep. Sean Casten (D-IL).
	•	The Water Power Research and Development Act (H.R. 6084) strengthens water power programs at the Department of Energy (DOE) and provides funding for research, development, demonstration, and commercialization of marine energy. McKinley is a lead cosponsor of the bill.
Below is a breakdown of funding amounts that McKinley championed in the Omnibus:
	•	Full funding for DOE’s Office of Fossil Energy, supporting clean and efficient energy creation at NETL in Morgantown. This also included report language preventing the use of funds to plan, develop, implement, or pursue the consolidation or closure of any of the NETL sites.
	•	$750 million for DOE’s Office of Fossil Energy Research and Development. In July, the House initially authorized $727.5 million for this program, and McKinley secured an amendment that increased that amount by $5 million, bumping the total to $732.5 million. After passage from both chambers, total funding for the Office of Fossil Energy Research and Development increased to $750 million.

	•	If soap and water are not available, use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% of alcohol.
	•	Avoid close contact with people who are sick.
	•	Put distance between yourself and other people if COVID-19 is spreading in the community.
	•	Wear a cloth face covering in public settings.
Take these steps to protect others:

1/8/21 18:03,This week's attack on the Capitol and other updates,"￼ 
  

Dear Neighbors, 
I hope this message finds you safe and well. As always, if you have questions or concerns, please contact my office by calling (847) 413-1959, emailing me at IL08.helpline@mail.house.gov, or sending a message through my website at https://krishnamoorthi.house.gov/contact/email. For more frequent updates, I’d encourage you to follow me on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.
Rioters Breaching The U.S. Capitol Building
I would like to begin by expressing the outrage I have felt this past week, along with so many Americans, as rioters stormed the Capitol Building, breached the Capitol Complex, and laid siege to the Capitol for many hours in an attempt to prevent the certification of the Electoral College vote in the presidential election. This insurrection left at least 5 people dead and numerous people injured, not to mention creating horrendous property destruction. During this chaos, I was forced to evacuate my office along with colleagues from both parties but was thankfully able to shelter in place in another section of the Capitol until the police and National Guard had secured the Capitol grounds. That same night, once the Capitol was secured, my colleagues and I finished the business of certifying the Electoral College vote around 4 A.M. in the morning in a determined show of democracy triumphing over mob rule.
I am determined and resolute in holding those who perpetrated this assault on our democracy accountable. We must never let this happen again as we will never give in to violence, mob rule, or sedition. I intend to work with people on both sides of the aisle to come together to move our country forward, and I will always fight for and defend the Constitution and democracy at all costs. The rioters will never prevail.  
Swearing-In of the 117th Congress
After Wednesday’s chaos, it’s hard to believe that just on Sunday I was honored to be sworn in as a member of the 117th Congress. This Congress is the most diverse in history and reflects the strength our country has to offer, regardless of party, as we combat the challenges of this pandemic. I take great pride in my role as your representative and vow to continue my work to improve the lives of everyone in our community.

Update on COVID-19 Case Rates and Vaccine Distribution
In Illinois, the COVID-19 case positivity rate has increased by 1.2% over the last week to reach an average of 8.6% this week. While our positivity rate was trending downward in late December, it has unfortunately increased which makes the effective distribution of coronavirus vaccines all the more important. As that process continues, we must continue to follow public health measures and expert guidance, including mask-wearing and practicing social distancing.
So far, the Chicago area has administered more than 34,000 doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. The first group to receive the vaccine are healthcare workers and long-term care facility residents. I am concerned by the lack of federal coordination and communication regarding the distribution of the vaccine, especially given reports that many Chicago-area health systems don’t know when to expect more vaccine shipments. That’s why I’m already working in Congress to ensure that this process is executed carefully and efficiently to accelerate inoculation rates while ensuring vaccine doses don’t expire or go to waste.
8th District Photography Contest
I’d like to invite you to participate in my district-wide landscape photography competition. We are lucky to be surrounded by so much beauty and nature in the 8th District of Illinois.

Please submit photos in their highest resolution and be advised that my office may use it. The winning photo will be announced via social media in early February. For more information click here. Good luck to all our photographers in the district!

Week of January 3, 2021  SWORN INTO THE 117TH CONGRESS

This past Sunday, I was sworn into the 117th Congress and officially started my second term in Congress. I was proud to once again take the oath to defend the Constitution and fight for our God-given rights and freedoms.

It is my honor to continue serving the people of the 6th District and being their voice in Washington. 

￼


THE ATTACK ON OUR NATION'S CAPITOL
 
Wednesday was a sad and dark day in our nation’s history. As the world looked on, our beloved Capitol building was attacked and overtook by violent protesters. I am outraged by the events that took place and condemn the violence in the strongest terms possible. Declaring an event to be a peaceful protest does not make it a protected right when the peaceful part is gone.

Thank you to all the heroic Law Enforcement Officers from Capitol Police, FBI, Secret Service, MPD, the National Guard, and others, for putting their lives on the line to protect us and secure the Capitol so my colleagues and I could finish the People’s business on the House Floor. No angry mob was going to stop us from fulfilling our constitutional duty. The violent rioters must be held accountable prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. God Bless our great nation. 

￼

 
OBJECTING TO THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES
 
Our Founding Fathers built this nation on the belief that our elected officials would be put in office by a free and fair process decided by the people. 

Although the violence we saw on Wednesday was inexcusable and reprehensible, it doesn’t change the fact that election laws were broken, and evidence of voter fraud has been presented. Both deserve to be investigated. I objected to certifying the Electoral College votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania to fight for the integrity of our elections and to give certainty to millions of Americans that our electoral process is safe and secure. 

 
THE AIR SECURITY ACT BECOMES LAW
 
Last week, The AIR Security Act became law as part of the National Defense Authorization Act. This legislation, introduced by Congressman Marc Veasey and myself, will help prevent companies backed by Communist China from using taxpayer dollars to commit IP theft and industrial espionage on American citizens and markets.

We cannot underestimate the lengths the Chinese Communist Party will go to gain inroads to our most critical infrastructure systems. Although I do not agree with everything in the NDAA, I am happy to see the multiple provisions that were included to hold Communist China accountable.


￼

 

The Passing of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick

Early this morning, I received the heartbreaking news that Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick had passed away from injuries he sustained from the attack on the Capitol. Brian bravely defended the Capitol from a group of violent thugs and we owe him a debt of gratitude.

The heroic men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police risk their lives every day to protect my colleagues, staff, and other personnel in the Capitol building so we can be a voice for our constituents in Washington. Join me in praying for Officer Sicknick's family, friends, and loved ones as they navigate the tragic days ahead.

1/8/21 16:59,What Happened in Washington this Week,"￼ 
  

Dear Neighbors,
This week, a group of violent insurrectionists tried to stop Congress from performing its Constitutional duty to certify the results of the presidential election. It was a horrific attack on our democracy. Congress reconvened to make official President-elect Biden’s and Vice President-elect Harris’s historic victory in the 2020 election. We will not allow violence to threaten our democracy and prevent Congress from performing its Constitutional duties.

Foxx Report
 
January 6th was a day of significance not only for the United States, but also for the entire world. Throughout the day, my focus was on my oath to the Constitution and preserving the promise of the United States. When I made my decision to object, I did so out of an abiding respect for the Constitution – the founding document that has been cemented in this great Republic for more than 230 years. If there are clear violations to the Constitution, they must be examined, assessed, and a verdict must be rendered. Anything less is an abdication of the duties I swore an oath to uphold. Of course, this was a monumental decision, and one that carries the appropriate justifications for an objection.
In the case of Pennsylvania, I could not vote in good conscience to certify electors from the state given the blatant contravention of state law that occurred. In Pennsylvania, following a lawsuit that was spearheaded by a Democrat national elections lawyer, the Democrat Secretary of State asked the state supreme court to approve a measure that would allow the use of ballot-return drop boxes that were anonymous, prolonging the ballot-receipt deadline, and striking the election-day postmark requirement. Specifically, these actions give rise to violations of Article II, Section I of the Constitution, and they open the floodgates to more allegations of voter fraud. Simply put: these violations carry the merits for an objection, and they pose a direct threat to the Constitution. I take that threat very seriously, and it’s one that cannot go unheeded.
In the case of Arizona, I could not vote in good conscience to de-certify the electors from the state. While the allegations of irregularities in Arizona’s presidential election are of grave concern, I do not believe they represent a violation of Article II, Section I of the Constitution. The changes to Arizona state law in dispute was a direct result to judicial review under the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. I disagree with the decisions of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit; however, it is not the role of Congress to reject certification of a state’s electors when the subject in dispute—Arizona state law—was a direct result of federal judicial review.
Other states have been subjected to irregularities and allegations of voter fraud and that is of grave concern to me. But the process enforced Wednesday left no room for objections on those grounds as they solely fall within the jurisdiction of state governments. State governments must do more, and we should all be pursuing greater transparency in free and fair elections as well. To be clear, I believe that all citizens should stand up for transparency in our elections. In court rooms. State legislatures. Town halls. I first sought to solve these issues in federal court when I joined my colleagues in signing the Amicus Brief to delay the certification of states that had their legislative powers usurped by fringe operators at the state level. We need to continue to fight within all the appropriate mediums to ensure that the integrity of our elections process is not subjected to further discord.
Let me be clear, the process that was before Congress did not carry the objective of subverting the principles of federalism. Subjectivity and conjecture had no place in this process. That’s why we should only be engaging in this process when there are clear violations to the Constitution. If the American people are to have confidence in elections now and in the future, the Constitution must not be forsaken. Without question, I am committed to restoring the confidence of the American people and upholding the Constitutional principles that guide this great Republic. That is my solemn duty every single day. I take my oath to protect and defend the Constitution very seriously and sitting idly by while it’s trampled over is simply unacceptable.
Have a blessed weekend.
Sincerely,
￼

THE RESILIENCY OF OUR REPUBLIC

This week we saw an assault on our Capitol. This violence is un-American, and I condemn it in the strongest terms. This is not who we are as a nation, and we must come together to restore law and order. While I will never forget that dark day, I will also never forget the heroes in the Capitol Police who rushed my colleagues and me to safety, and Robin and I are praying for the family of the U.S. Capitol Police Officer who was lost, Officer Brian Sicknick. 

The fact that we went back in the House Chamber that night and finished conducting the business of counting the Electoral Votes shows the resiliency of our Republic. 

The objections brought forward to certifying certain states’ Electoral College votes were not about any political figure – it was about the Constitution. Changes to our election system were made without the consent of state legislatures -- the bodies responsible for governing elections -- and until these questions, among others, are answered, I could not vote to certify the Electoral College votes for the two states contested by a Representative and a Senator, Arizona and Pennsylvania. I urge state legislatures to urgently take up election reform so we can start restoring faith in our election process.

However, now that the Electoral College votes have been certified, I believe we must come together and unify as a nation – especially in light of this week.

￼

117th Congress Begins

On Sunday, I was sworn in to the 117th Congress and I’m ready to get to work! Thank you to the 12th District for giving me the honor of continuing to serve you.

Visiting Department of Public Health Vaccination Site 

￼

I joined Dr. Stephen Goggans, District Health Director of the East Central Health District, in a visit to a Department of Public Health Vaccination Site at Craig-Houghton Elementary School in Augusta. During the visit I received an update on vaccine distribution efforts.

Opposing House Democrats’ Rule Changes for 117th Congress

￼

This week House Democrats passed a package to change the Rules for the 117th Congress that would pave the way for their costly socialist policies, continue voting by proxy, and gut the minority party’s ability to amend legislation This is a ridiculous abuse of power.

Department of Education Delivers COVID Relief for K-12 Students, Teachers and Schools 

This week the Department of Education announced that more than $54 billion in emergency relief funding is now available to support fully reopening K-12 schools, and will help to measure and address the learning loss caused by a lack of in-person options for families. This funding is part of the $81.9 billion Congress allocated to the Education Stabilization Fund in the latest COVID relief package, which I supported in the House. 

ICYMI: COVID Relief Package Ends Surprise Billing

I’ve long advocated for working on bipartisan legislation to end surprise medical billing, which will ensure properly insured patients do not end up with costly, unexpected charges after going to a hospital or other health care provider. I’m glad to share that legislation to end this harmful practice was included in the COVID-19 relief package that Congress passed in December. This free-market solution will take patients out of the middle and fairly resolves payment disputes between plans and providers. 

￼

With the 117th Congress kicking off this week, I remain committed to addressing government spending and our skyrocketing national debt. That’s why the first joint resolution I cosponsored this Congress -- H.J.Res.3 – proposes a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States.

Rules for Thee but Not for Me 
I wanted to start this week’s Short Report by addressing the events that occurred at the United States Capitol on January 6th. I believe that what happened at the Capitol Building was disgraceful and completely unacceptable and I condemn the actions of those involved in the strongest possible terms. I commend the brave men and women of the United States Capitol Police, the Washington Metropolitan Police and the officers of the various federal agencies that assisted in restoring order in the Capitol and keeping Members of Congress and their staff safe. The death of 35 year old Ashli Babbitt and Officer Brian Sicknick during this mob violence is tragic. Ashli was a decorated Air Force veteran who served multiple tours in the Middle East and Officer Sicknick was a career Capitol Police officer. My prayers are with their families, and the families of those who were injured during this incursion. Despite these events, our Republic and this institution will endure. The business of Congress must go on.
In last week’s short report, I wrote that I “hope Democrats surprise me by getting back to work for the American people,” with the start of the new year. Well, we are just one week into the 117th Congress and my hopes have been dashed. Members of Congress vote on the rules that govern the business of the House of Representatives at the start of each new Congress. This year, House Democrats have forced through the most partisan and egregious set of rules in modern history.
For over 100 years, the House of Representatives, through a Motion to Recommit, has afforded the minority party a way to alter legislation that is being put on the floor for a vote. During this time, thousands of Motions to Recommit have been voted on in the House of Representatives. During the 116th Congress, Republicans used this tool several times to successfully alter partisan legislation put forth by the Democrat majority. Unfortunately, House Democrats have decided to weaken what is really the only opportunity for the minority party to put its mark on partisan pieces of legislation. Under the Democrat’s new rules package, the Motion to Recommit can no longer be used to alter legislation. This is proof the Democrats are afraid of Republican ideas and ideals being placed in their partisan proposals and is just another way to shut down the voices of those that don’t agree with them. 
Shutting down opposing viewpoints seems to be a trend in the new rules of the 117thCongress. In what can only be described as a disgusting change to the rules, Democrats have decided that they need to stifle the first amendment right of other Members of Congress and their staff. The new rules make it an ethics violation for members of Congress or their employees to post or share anything that others think may be inappropriate or unfounded. With Democrats in control, posting something they may not agree with can be viewed by many Democrats as unfounded or inappropriate, resulting in an ethics violation for me or someone on my staff. The Democratic majority is going to decide what is and isn’t inappropriate or unfounded language. This is supposed to be an institution that upholds the Constitution but instead, it is stepping on it with such an egregious violation of the first amendment being included in these rules. It is unacceptable to shut down the speech of any American but it is simply despicable that Democrats would seek to control the speech and messaging coming from other members of Congress.
This is par for the course for Democrats; when they don’t get their way, they change rules and norms, some of which have been precedent for upwards of a century. Unable to get Obama appointed judges through the Senate? Change the rule from 60 votes needed to the “nuclear option” of 51 votes needed. Trump beats Clinton? Democrats proposed disenfranchising low-population states through abolishing the electoral college. Trump and the Senate fulfill their constitutional duty to fill a Supreme Court vacancy? Democrats propose packing the courts to invalidate Trump appointed Justices. Republicans propose common sense changes to partisan legislation through the Motion to Recommit? Democrats change the rule so that we can no longer alter legislation through a Motion to Recommit. Through this rules package, the Democratic party continue their precedent of being the spoiled child that changes the rules of the game when they lose.
Unfortunately, the millions of Americans struggling can’t change the rules when they find themselves in a tight spot. It was my hope that with the new Congress would come newfound bipartisanship, but this rules package signals that any intent to work with Republicans or hear their ideas will be shut down. It is disheartening that this is the state of the people’s house, but new rules or not, I will continue to fight for conservative ideals in this Congress and make sure that your voice is heard.

1/8/21 13:10,Now Law: Baldwin’s Bipartisan Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Act,"

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
Senator Baldwin’s bipartisan Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) Act, which reauthorizes and expands funding for the Great Lakes, has been signed into law.   The bipartisan bill reauthorizes the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which was set to expire at the end of Fiscal Year 2021, for another five years. The bill increases the current authorization level from $300 million to $375 million in Fiscal Year 2022 and increases funding by $25 million per year until it reaches $475 million in Fiscal Year 2026. 
“The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has earned bipartisan support and is critical for the health of our region, our communities, and our clean water resources. It helps us clean up polluted sites, restore water quality and combat invasive species,” said Senator Baldwin. “Preserving the Great Lakes is not just an environmental goal - it is an economic necessity for Wisconsin, and making stronger, long-term investments in GLRI will better help us ensure that our Great Lakes are protected and preserved for generations to come.” 
Since its inception, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has tripled the successful cleanup and delisting of Areas of Concern, reduced phosphorus runoff and the threat of harmful algal blooms, controlled and stopped the advancement of invasive species, and restored wildlife habitat over thousands of miles of rivers and waterways. Since 2010, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative has provided more than $2.5 billion to fund 4,706 projects throughout the Great Lakes region.  Senator Baldwin, a member of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, was joined by Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and Rob Portman (R-OH), co-Chairs of the Senate Great Lakes Task Force, and Representatives David Joyce (R-OH) and Marcy Kaptur (D-OH) in introducing this bipartisan legislation.  Read more about Senator Baldwin’s bipartisan Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) Act here.

1/8/21 13:01,Blaine’s Bulletin: We Will Rebuild,"￼ 
January 8, 2020
For Immediate Release | Contact: Georgeanna Sullivan (202) 225-2956 

BLAINE'S BULLETIN: WE WILL REBUILD
In my June 26th Bulletin I wrote that our law enforcement officers “commit to a life where their own personal safety comes second to everyone around them. They put their lives on the line every single day and run directly into harm’s way when the rest of us are trying to get out of it.” I also wrote of the “chaos and danger created by lawlessness and mob rule.” Sadly, only seven months later we once again saw police officers and government institutions being attacked by opportunists dead set on creating chaos. The men and women of the United States Capitol Police, Washington, D.C. Police, the National Guard, and several other surrounding police departments put their lives on the line to protect one of the symbols of our democracy. There is no excuse for the violence that took place on Wednesday, and we are forever indebted to our law enforcement officers for their protection and service. 
Wednesday morning, before the House and Senate met for the joint session to count electors, I released a statement with several of my colleagues discussing the constitutionality of certain states altering their election processes. The Constitution clearly states that only the state legislatures are given the authority to direct the manner of appointing presidential electors. By circumventing their state legislatures and unilaterally changing voting laws, multiple state governments violated the plain language of Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution. Changing election laws in an unconstitutional manner mean the slates of electors produced under those modified laws are thus unconstitutional, not ""regularly given"" or ""lawfully certified"" as required by the Electoral Count Act of 1887. Election laws are in place to ensure the integrity of our elections and must be followed. Because of that fact I felt dutybound to object. 
Objecting was a difficult decision and certainly one I do not take lightly. Ultimately, the Constitution, U.S. law, and historic precedent were the basis of my decision. It was made not to allow Congress to pick the President – that is in no way Congress’ duty or right – but to ensure the American People did.
Throughout my discussions with lawyers and upon my decision to object I – like all Americans – never dreamed that in a few short hours rioters would be scaling the Capitol walls and ransacking the halls of Congress. After hours of chaos, in which at least four people lost their lives, many Members of Congress wanted to delay the count or quickly approve all electors without debate. I certainly don’t blame them for those feelings. However, no amount of intimidation or threat of violence can change the words of the Constitution and what I believe is my duty as the representative of Missouri’s Third District, so I voted in support of the objections on the House floor.  
With emotions still high, it is being said that objections are unprecedented or somehow an afront to democracy. That couldn’t be further from the truth. During the elector counting of 2017, House Democrats objected to the electors of nine states. They cited everything from voter suppression to Russian interference to corrupted voting machines. Throughout their arguments I never once accused them of treason, sedition, or any type of crimes against our democracy. In 2005, after President Bush won re-election, Democrats objected to the state of Ohio for what they called “serious election irregularities.” There are plenty of other examples I could give, but my point is this: it is extremely disingenuous to suggest objecting to electorates is unprecedented.  We are all outraged by the riots that occurred Wednesday; we don’t need faux outrage from my colleagues for the objections they themselves have raised.
The attack on the Capitol was a tragic moment for America. Every American at every level should strongly condemn those acts and seek the justice that should be carried out. We must also learn from this moment and find a new way of debating matters of national importance. When Joe Biden is sworn in as our President, I will do everything I can to protect our economic and personal freedom from government overreach. And I will continually push state legislatures and the courts to ensure an election that left doubt in so many American minds never happens again. While some of those conversations will be contentious and tempers may flair, they will be carried out respectfully, without violence, and keeping in mind that we are all Americans.

1/7/21 22:08,Yesterday,"
￼ 
Dear Neighbor,  Yesterday, we experienced an unprecedented—almost unimaginable—attack on our country.   As you surely know, as the Vice President of the United States, the Senate, and the House of Representatives convened to do the most sacred of duties—certifying the states’ results of the electoral college for the next President of the United States—a seditious mob stormed the United States Capitol building.   Because I have the privilege of representing you, I have the privilege to work in the United States Capitol.  And I was there, in this hallowed place, in the Gallery of the House of Representatives chamber yesterday to be present for the certification of the 2020 election as our Capitol building and the democratic system of government that it represents was attacked.  Many of our neighbors expressed their concerns for my safety and for the safety of our country yesterday, and I am grateful to all for this outpouring of support.  And I am grateful to the Capitol Police officers and law enforcement officers who protected me and the others present in the House during this sad and shameful attack.    So many constituents have visited Washington throughout my tenure, and it is always a thrill to share with them the majesty of the Capitol—the People’s House.  Yesterday, our House was taken over by a mob that desecrated its halls and forced the people’s elected representatives to evacuate to safety.  Many of the harrowing images you may have seen in reporting are the things I witnessed.  And having witnessed them, it is clear that we must respond to this devastating attack as well as to the continued threat of danger at this moment.  There are many matters relating to yesterday’s events that must be examined and addressed, but one matter is urgent: It is now clear that the President of the United States represents a grave threat to our Constitution and to our country.  This insurrection was incited, encouraged, and praised by the President of the United States, who willfully incited violence against the Government of the United States.  It is for these reasons that I support his removal from office as soon as possible, whether through the process set forth in the 25th Amendment to the Constitution or through the constitutional process of impeachment.  I hope you know that I have reached this conclusion after careful consideration and after witnessing firsthand an assault on the United States that not long ago would have been unthinkable.  As you likely know now, too, despite yesterday’s attack on our Capitol and our country, our Congress went back to the People’s House last night to complete the certification process.  And we did so.  When I left the House around 4:00 this morning, the certification was complete and the hallmark of our democracy—the peaceful transfer of power—was very much in tact.  My colleagues and I remain committed to working together to repair the damage that has been done, to our Capital and to our country.   As always, I am honored and proud to do this work as your representative to the Congress.
Sincerely, 
￼

1/7/21 21:45,Yesterday’s Assault on our Democracy,"￼  
Dear Friend,   Americans have witnessed many foreign strongmen ignore elections to cling to power. I never thought we would see this kind of attempted coup in our most hallowed temple of democracy, but that’s exactly what happened yesterday. The American people have rejected Donald Trump’s failed leadership, but he and his loyalists were trying to find any means by which to keep him in power. That is unacceptable in any democratic republic.   We should be clear, though, that the attack on our democracy was not only perpetrated by the violent mob that trashed the U.S. Capitol, but by elected representatives who serve there. There is no evidence of any systemic fraud in any of the six states that a group of senators on the other side of the aisle planned to challenge. All such claims were examined not only by respective state authorities, but also by the courts. The violent mob of insurrectionists and the Congressional objectors shared the same goal: overturn the election executed according to our Constitution and laws to seize power for their losing candidate.     ￼  Click here to listen to the remarks I gave on the Senate floor once the chamber was able to reconvene and complete our responsibility under the Constitution to certify the Electoral College’s votes.>>>    The riot in the Capitol demands swift accountability, including removing President Trump from office, either by impeachment or the 25th Amendment.  And there should be criminal investigation and prosecutions of both rioters and those who incited or conspired with them to address yesterday’s actions. Justice demands accountability.   Responsibility for yesterday’s attempted coup runs deep. It starts with the president of course, but the failure of President Trump’s allies in Congress to stand up and speak the truth and dismiss the false claims and conspiracy theories promoted by the president led to yesterday’s attempted insurrection. When a president attempts to deceive the public and inspire an anti-democratic revolt, it’s the responsibility of all every single leader -- regardless of party -- to stand up, set the record straight, and protect and defend our constitutional republic.   And we should be clear that the efforts to overturn the election are only the latest efforts by a privileged and powerful elite to hold power in spite of the will of the people. For years, their vast pools of corporate and dark money, voter suppression, and partisan gerrymandering have conspired to manipulate elections. Our democracy has been under assault for a long time and we need robust election reforms to rebuild government of, by, and for the People.   I look forward to serving in the Senate while Joe Biden and Kamala Harris lead our nation. We must immediately address the economic and health care issues raised by the pandemic. We need to invest in the foundations for families to thrive -- which means health care, housing, education and good paying jobs. We need to restore our democracy and take on voter suppression, gerrymandering, and dark money -- the real issues corrupting our election system. And we need to take on the biggest issue facing our planet: climate chaos.   We have a long road ahead of us, and I hope you will join me in committing to traveling that road with decency and respect for one another and the institutions of our constitutional republic. We have so much work to do, and we need to get to that work right away.   All my best,  Jeff

A Reminder of How Hard We Have to Fight to Keep our Democracy 
 
My husband Archie was in Washington, D.C. this past week to keep me company while the U.S. Senate worked over New Year's.  As I was driving him to the airport on Tuesday, he expressed concern about what might happen on Wednesday when Congress would vote to confirm the electoral college results that would make Joe Biden our next President.  Congress was scheduled to meet in joint session at virtually the same time President Trump - near the White House - was inciting thousands of his supporters to continue to attack those election results.

I said ""Archie, don't worry, the United States Capitol must be one of the most safe places in the whole world."" But less than 24 hours later, I was literally running down the hallways of the Capitol with my colleagues to try to get away from a violent mob of people that had breached the Capitol and were just outside the Senate chamber.
 
A Strike At Our Core Principles
 
Wednesday's attacks on the U.S. Capitol and federal buildings strike at the core principle of our democracy, that the people decide who represents them. The seditionists were incited by the most destructive and anti-democratic President in our history. For too long, some political leaders, especially the President, have been using their power and position to fuel distrust in our elections with no evidence and no purpose other than to advance their own personal political power.  It's despicable and runs counter to our oath of office, to protect the United States from all enemies foreign and domestic.    A President who incites his supporters to violently attack their own government is a clear and present danger to our democracy. President Trump should be removed from office immediately, either through the 25th amendment or impeachment.   Further, those who laid siege to the Capitol must be brought to justice, and the lawmakers who collaborated with President Trump in his dangerous yet futile attempt to overturn the election also bear responsibility for what happened. Finally, we need answers and accountability for yesterday's security failures.
 
Democracy Prevailed: Restoring Faith in Our Fundamental Democratic Values 
 
We will get through these dark days.  I truly believe our democracy is resilient and can withstand this desperate and failed coup attempt.  But it's a reminder of how hard we have to fight for our core principles: that no one is above the law, and that in a democracy the people decide.    Last night, democracy prevailed: I returned to the Senate, and the Congress certified that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be our next President and Vice President. They will take office on January 20, because the voters of this country chose them to lead us through this challenging chapter in our history. I am committed to working to restore and strengthen our shared faith in our fundamental democratic values.

1/7/21 18:35,My reflections on yesterday,"￼
January 7, 2021
Dear Friend,
What happened yesterday in the United States Capitol is such an embarrassment for a country that has been looked up to around the world for over 200 years. When you look at history, democracy is the exception. Our democracy is not automatic or self-sustaining. It requires work and commitment from every single one of us.
Since President Trump lost his bid for reelection, he, and those enabling his behavior, have spread debunked conspiracy theories and bold-faced lies to sow distrust in the results of our democratic election. We saw the real life consequences of the president's reckless words when he incited the mob violence and insurrection that led to the loss of four lives and mass terror in the heart of our democracy.
President Trump's attack on our democracy and his attempt to overturn the results of our democratic election did not and will not succeed. Last night, as soon as we were safely able to return, the House and Senate officially certified that President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris won the 2020 election. In less than two weeks, they will be sworn into office--reflecting the will of the American people. 
We all need to come together as a unified nation to heal our communities and build back from this crisis moment. We still are living through the gravest pandemic in over a century--we lost 47 of our fellow New Mexicans to Covid-19 yesterday alone. Too many American families are struggling to make ends meet. Our nation is also reckoning with systemic racial injustice and a climate crisis that threatens everything about our way of life. Our elected leaders should be squarely focused on how we can work with our new president to address these major challenges.
I urge all Americans--regardless of who we voted for in this past election--to reject our outgoing president's brazen attempts to trample on our American values. We must support a peaceful transition of power and restore our democracy. 
Sincerely,
￼

Dear Friends,  Yesterday, the world witnessed a violent mob breach the U.S. Capitol in an effort to overthrow our government and overturn the presidential election. And making matters worse, the bloodshed and destruction was incited by Donald Trump.
 
Even with just two weeks until President-Elect Biden is sworn in, I believe Donald Trump must be removed from office immediately, either through invoking the 25th Amendment or through another impeachment proceeding.
 
I want to hear from you: Do you support impeaching President Trump?

1/7/21 17:20,Invoking The 25th Amendment,"My oath is to the Constitution
￼ 
  Dear Lindsey, 
Yesterday, the President incited an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol in an effort to undermine the will of the American people. His actions were a threat not only to our Democratic Republic, but also to our national security.

This morning, at roughly 1:30AM, I defended our Pennsylvania electoral votes on the House Floor. Despite the best attempts of those wishing to see our democracy fall, the House and Senate reconvened to ensure that the will of the people of Pennsylvania and the nation was honored. Our country’s resolve is being tested. We will find our fortitude and pass this test. Our democracy is worth it.

Already, my office is fielding hundreds of calls and messages in response to yesterday's attack, and we are listening to your thoughts on what we must do as a nation to heal. That's why I put together a simple, one-question survey: Do you believe the Vice President and Cabinet should invoke the 25th Amendment? It's time sensitive that I hear from as many of you as possible. Please take a minute to complete the short survey below and sign up for my updates.

Condemning Yesterday's Violence
￼
￼
￼
￼
The violence that occurred at the U.S. Capitol yesterday is heartbreaking. I had the opportunity late yesterday evening to review the video of what had been going on, after it was deemed safe for Members to leave our undisclosed, secure location. We have inherited such a gift as Americans, and I am grieved by what we saw.

The violence and intimidation on display undermines the very objectives of a free and functioning Republic and has absolutely no place here. A number of Capitol Police took the brunt of the violence. Please continue to keep them and their families in their prayers.

Three days ago, I once again took a solemn oath to “support and defend the Constitution of the United States."" And despite yesterday's events, Congress persevered and held one of the most important votes regarding the Constitution and the Republic which rest upon it — that of certifying the electoral college results sent from the states.

I objected to seating the electors in five states where major unconstitutional election changes happened. Although ultimately Congress certified the results, I believe light needs to be shed on the the critical issues I and others have raised about the election process. 
￼

The First Bill I Introduced This Year
￼
￼
￼
￼
I am resolved to hold the line and stand for life throughout my tenure in Congress. That’s why the first bill I introduced in the 117th Congress was a pro-life bill advocating for the unborn and their pregnant mothers in need called the Women's Public Health and Safety Act. 

I first introduced this bill during the 116th Congress in order to keep federal taxpayer dollars from funding abortions. One of Planned Parenthood’s main funding streams is state Medicaid dollars, which are largely reimbursed by federal tax dollars. The original purpose of Medicaid was to provide healthcare for people in need. Yet we know that abortion is not healthcare. However, Planned Parenthood has access to billions in state Medicaid funding. 

The Women’s Public Health and Safety Act ensures that states have the right to exclude abortion providers from receiving Medicaid dollars. This will free up funding for providers that actually care for women. My bill supports mothers in need, protects the life of the unborn, and takes another step in getting tax dollars out of the abortion business. I reintroduced it this Congress to keep working to ensure it will pass Congress and be signed into law.

New House Rules This Congress

Speaker Pelosi's new House Rules passed by the Democrats this week amount to a declaration of war on good governance. Already real floor debate and the opportunity to offer amendments on legislation has been restricted. Now she has removed what's called the Motion to Recommit, which for 100 years has been one of the few ways minority's only opportunity to be able to influence legislation. 

According to the new Rules, proxy voting will also continue. This scheme marks a historic deviation away from how the House was designed to conduct the people’s business. Our government is in place in order to protect liberty, not make life easier for politicians.  

Not only will this unconstitutional voting method continue, but other bad provisions were included. Terms that reflect gender, such as ""mother"" and ""father,"" are no longer permitted. 
 
Instead of actually governing and helping the American people, House Democrats continue to peddle nonsense. #SocialismSilencesYourVoice

Investigating the Chinese Communist Party's Malign Influence
￼
￼
￼
￼
Last month, I joined the Ranking Members of the Oversight Committee in a letter to Director of the FBI Christopher Wray regarding our concern over the Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) illegal spying on American citizens. It's well documented that the CCP is stealing intellectual property and suppressing Americans’ free speech when they criticize China.

This letter follows months of work conducted by our Committee to investigate the CCP’s malign influence in America’s most sacred educational and governmental institutions. The conclusion of the investigation is, put simply, to call out the CCP for what they are: adversaries. 

As the letter notes, “Indeed, the Director of National Intelligence recently proclaimed China as ‘the greatest threat to America today’ and the greatest threat to democracy and freedom world-wide since World War II.”

To further discuss this issue of critical national importance, we requested the FBI work with us on scheduling a staff level briefing. We hope to better understand both the threats of Communist China as well as what the FBI is doing to combat their attacks on America. Read the full letter HERE.

Supreme Court Declines Census Case Ruling

The Supreme Court declined to issue a definitive ruling last month on President Trump's order that would exclude people in the country illegally from being counted in the census. Knowing how many people in our country are citizens is certainly constitutional and should not be controversial. I completely support President Trump's push to receive an accurate census count.

Congresswoman Beatty Reflects, Reacts to Failed Insurrection During Electoral College Certification  
U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) issued the following statement in response to yesterday’s failed insurrection instigated by President Donald J. Trump during the meeting of the Electoral College: 
“The terrorist attack at the Capitol was an assault on our democracy and every American. For the last four years, Trump has used the office of the presidency to divide us, spread lies and far-flung conspiracies, give credence to the darkest corners of the Internet, and feed his ego. What we witnessed yesterday was unbelievable, un-American, and a manifestation of all that is wretched about Donald Trump. That is why I call on Vice President Mike Pence and the Cabinet to immediately invoke the 25th Amendment and for Congress to begin impeachment proceedings.  Finally, I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the serious break down in police protection, preparedness, response, and conduct during the attack. The video tapes of police opening barricade gates, taking photos, and allowing rioters to scale the Capitol building is truly unfathomable—especially considering the overly aggressive, militarized response to Black Lives Matter protests this past summer nationwide.""

Dear friend,
 
I am grateful for everyone who has reached out to check on me and my team over the last 24 hours. We are all safe.
 
Early this morning, Congress certified the election of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. The results of our fair and free election - the will of the American people - is respected and effectuated. But yesterday’s events were shocking to the conscience.
 
It’s outrageous that people attempted to disrupt a peaceful transfer of power from one president to another. That's what makes America America. This domestic terrorist attack was incited by a president who continues with his lies and attacks the very heart of our democracy - a peaceful transition of power under our Constitution. Trump has always thumbed his nose at the Constitution, but this was egregious, and I am angry and I'm saddened by it still. 
 
The first order of business was to ensure that the electors of the Electoral College from each state were accepted here in the Congress. Now it is evident that Trump cannot remain in office any longer. The Congress will have a lot of debate over what is next over the next two weeks. Unfortunately, Trump will always put his personal interest over the interest of America. He will not be satisfied and he will continue with his unlawful, unhinged conduct. And impeachment or the 25th Amendment may be a remedy. I am cosponsoring such resolutions.
 
I am hopeful that dangerous political distractions will end so that the country can focus on a speedy, fair and equitable COVID-19 vaccine rollout. The latest emergency relief package provided significant funds to states and local communities to ramp up the vaccine distribution effort.  The Haley VA is administering vaccinations and Hillsborough County began scheduling appointments for residents 65 and over. While, the County filled its vaccine appointments, additional appointments are expected next week, and you can visit the county’s website for updates. 
 
I am extremely frustrated over the lack of a comprehensive plan to tackle COVID-19 in the State of Florida, and the vaccine rollout is yet another example of Governor DeSantis’ inability to meet this moment. I have voted time and time again to rush resources home to crush the virus and will continue to press for a thoughtful and equitable vaccination plan.. 
 
Former Governor Rick Scott and Governor DeSantis spent years devaluing our public health system and demonizing the role of government. Now we are left with a hollow shell and leaders who are not up to the job. They fly by the seat of their pants and fail to help our neighbors whether in normal times or in emergencies. Even at this late hour, I urge the governor to come up with a coherent plan and increase his communication and transparency with leaders on the ground so that all of our neighbors have the latest and most accurate information available and the hope and confidence that can come with it. I am grateful for my local partners at Hillsborough County, the Haley VA, local hospitals, USF and the City of Tampa who continue to try to do their best with little support from the State to keep our neighbors safe and healthy.
  
 
Coronavirus Aid
 
  
Important for our community, a fifth coronavirus aid package was signed into law on December 28 that will address many of the ongoing needs of our neighbors, small businesses, schools, hospitals and more. 
 
House Democrats fought for the inclusion of a second direct cash payment of $600 to many adults and children, averted the sudden expiration of Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits for millions and added a $300 per week UI enhancement for Americans out of work. This legislation includes over $280 billion in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, including funds that will be targeted for underserved communities, nonprofits, and the mom and pops shops we know and love here in Tampa. 
 
Hope is on the horizon with the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and I pushed to ensure over $73 billion in public health investments to keep the foot on the gas and support the free, safe and equitable vaccine distribution that is necessary to crush the virus. 
 
While the bill meets many needs of working Floridians, there is far more to be done to address the ongoing health and economic crises facing our nation. President-elect Biden has made clear his commitment to crushing the virus, listening to public health experts, and getting money into the pockets of the American people, and I will work with his administration from day 1 to bring this crisis to an end.
 
You can read more about this legislation here.
 
You can check the status of your direct cash assistance payment on the IRS’ website here.
  
 
Select Committee on the Climate Crisis
 
  
In the previous Congress, the House directed that a Select Committee on the Climate Crisis develop a roadmap for America’s clean energy future. I was honored to be chosen to chair the Committee by Speaker Pelosi, and look forward to continuing our work in the 117th Congress.
 
With a broad cross section of ideas and input, the Committee developed a majority staff report that provides a detailed roadmap for action. Some of our recommendations already have been adopted into law through bipartisan legislation, but we have much more work to do. Our bipartisan Select Committee intends to advance clean energy solutions that unleash American innovation, promote environmental justice, and create good family sustaining jobs in Florida and all communities across our great country. The Georgia Senate election results should buoy everyone that progress on clean energy jobs and environmental justice is at hand.  Floridians have so much at stake here.
  
￼
  
 
Contact My Office
 
  
As we start a new year, I want to remind all of our neighbors that my team is here to cut through red tape and bureaucracy on behalf of families and neighbors across the Tampa area. I’m proud to share that in 2020, my office worked to deliver nearly $1.6 million to veterans, seniors, small businesses and families in 2020; almost $1.5 billion in federal grants to create jobs, invest in education and infrastructure, mitigate impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and support the important work of local partners; and $2.7 billion in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans for Tampa businesses.
 
Don’t hesitate to call my Tampa office for assistance at 813-871-2817. Stay safe, remember to continue following the advice of public health experts and wear a mask and social distance as we continue to fight the coronavirus.
  
Sincerely,
￼

Dear Neighbor, 
 
Yesterday was a very dark and difficult day for our country and our republic. As the Congress met to fulfill our democratic duty to certify the results of the 2020 election, violent insurrectionists breached the U.S. Capitol Complex, causing the House chambers to be evacuated and for myself and my colleagues to be evacuated from the floor. 
 
I am so grateful for the concern and well wishes shared by many of you, and that we were kept safe and the Capitol was eventually secured. 
 
Let me be clear. This violence was an assault on our very democracy. In the United States of America, this is not how we settle political disputes. Here, in the United States, we respect the rule of law. We accept the results of free and fair elections. We do not ignore the will of the voters. 
 
Following yesterday's events, the House and Senate reconvened to finish our work and complete our duty to the American people by certifying Joe Biden as the next President of the United States. As the United States Congress we will not be intimidated. We will always fulfill our oath to the constitution and our duty to the American people. 
 
As one of four lawmakers selected by Speaker Pelosi to lead debate on the House floor to defend our democracy, I had the opportunity to speak in support of our constitution, and our very Republic. 
 
 
￼
 
  
It is not always easy to sit with, listen to and respect someone who disagrees with you. It is never easy to lose an election. But these are also both wholly American acts of good faith. Our friend and late leader, Congressman John Lewis said, “We are one people with one family. We all live in the same house... and … we must find a way to say to people that we must lay down the burden of hate. For hate is too heavy a burden to bear.""
 
We must come together as a nation and begin to heal from the divisions that are tearing us apart. The sake of our democracy and our Republic depend on it. 
 
I'm keeping you all in my thoughts and prayers. Please stay safe and stay hopeful, 
￼

 Rep. Wright's Statement on Capitol Attack and Objecting to Electoral College Votes
 
Washington, D.C. – This morning, Congressman Ron Wright (TX-06) issued the following statement:   “Yesterday was a sad and dark day in our nation’s history. As the world looked on, our beloved Capitol building was attacked and overtook by violent protesters. I am outraged by the events of yesterday and condemn the violence in the strongest terms possible. Declaring an event to be a peaceful protest does not make it a protected right when the peaceful part is gone.  Thank you to all the heroic Law Enforcement Officers from Capitol Police, FBI, Secret Service, MPD, the National Guard, and others, for putting their lives on the line to protect us and secure the Capitol so my colleagues and I could finish the People’s business on the House Floor. No angry mob was going to stop us from fulfilling our constitutional duty.  Although what we saw yesterday was inexcusable and reprehensible, it doesn’t change the fact that election laws were broken, and evidence of voter fraud has been presented. Both deserve to be investigated. Last night, I objected to certifying the Electoral College votes from Arizona and Pennsylvania to fight for the integrity of our elections and to give certainty to millions of Americans that our electoral process is safe and secure.  Civil discourse, debate, and peaceful protests are vital to our democracy, but violence is never and will never be the answer. God Bless our great nation.”

Newsletter Update - January 2021

Burchett sworn in for a second term, highlighting the heroism of police officers during the Nashville Christmas Day bombing and 2020 in review
￼

Hello Lindsey,

Happy New Year and I hope you had a great holiday season. I am looking forward to getting back to work for East Tennesseans this year.

I was sworn in for my second term serving Tennessee’s Second Congressional District on January 3. It’s an honor to once again serve East Tennesseans in the 117th Congress. I am looking forward to standing up for conservative values, fighting for less government intrusion into our daily lives, getting the national economy reopened and finding common ground with my colleagues across the aisle to achieve results. 

The explosion that rocked Downtown Nashville on Christmas Day shocked not just Tennessee, but the entire country. I was saddened someone committed this horrible act on such an important day for millions of Americans and it is a miracle no innocent lives were lost. Heroic actions by six Nashville police officers – one of which received his police training in Knoxville – saved over 50 families before the blast.


These officers’ courage should remind us of the important role law enforcement plays in keeping our communities safe, even when danger is least expected. I recently joined Fox News to discuss the Christmas Day explosion, and the importance of supporting state and local law enforcement departments. Click here or on the image below to watch my full interview.  
￼

My offices assisted thousands of East Tennesseans over the last year. The coronavirus pandemic prompted many constituents to contact my Knoxville office looking for assistance with federal agencies, and my team helped resolve many inquiries. We also responded to over 35,000 East Tennesseans expressing their opinions on important topics.


I’m proud of the work we did to stay accessible to constituents during a challenging year. If we can ever assist you, please contact my Washington or Knoxville office. Our contact information is listed at the end of this email.
￼

In DC, my legislative record last year was reflective of East Tennessee’s conservative values and the needs of our community. My first bill, the Microloan Transparency and Accountability Act, unanimously passed the House of Representatives and this important legislation improves investment in rural small businesses. I also cosponsored measures to deliver aid to small businesses struggling during the coronavirus pandemic and supported legislation to increase transparency in the American healthcare system, among others. 

I am excited to build on my successes from the 116th Congress, and I will continue fighting for East Tennesseans during my second term.  
￼

I am optimistic for what the future holds following a difficult year for all of us. And I wish you all continued good health as we start this New Year.

You’ll find my office contact info below. Please reach out if you have any questions or concerns. 

Sincerely,
￼

1/7/21 0:00,Democracy prevails on this dark day,"￼
Dear Friend,
 
It has been a dark, dark day for our nation.
 
Let me start by saying that my staff and I are safe, and we are incredibly grateful to each of you who has reached out to check on us.
 
I am also deeply thankful to the countless officers and members of law enforcement who rushed toward the danger today to restore order in the United States Capitol and who are continuing to work to secure the surrounding area.
 
There is simply no other way to describe what happened today: Domestic terrorists attacked the Capitol. They attacked the People’s House – your house – and in the process, they engaged in an assault on our very Democracy.
 
As of this writing, order has been restored. The Capitol is secure once again, and I am proud to say that we have resumed our constitutional obligation to count and certify the Electoral College votes.
 
What is of the utmost importance in the coming hours, days, and weeks is for those who perpetrated these attacks to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. However, merely holding to account those who viciously assaulted police officers and illegally entered the Capitol would fall short of what is necessary to prevent another such insurgency from happening again.
 
Donald Trump is directly responsible for the attack. His constant lying about the 2020 election inspired those who attempted to prevent us from upholding our duty. He is unfit to serve another second as President of the United States, and he should never be able to hold office again.
 
It is imperative that his Cabinet invoke the 25th Amendment and remove him from office. If they are too cowardly to stand up to him, Congress should move forward with Articles of Impeachment immediately.
 
Our Democracy was damaged today, but we are not defeated. Far from it. We will overcome this stain on our nation’s history, and we will do it together.
 
Thank you again, and God bless America.
 
 
Warm regards,
￼

Bergman Statement on Electoral College Certification Process and Lawlessness at Capitol 

Washington - Rep. Jack Bergman released the following statement:
In times of tension and turmoil, leaders stand up and do what is right. I made it very clear this week that I intended to stand for my belief that irregularities, discrepancies, and usurpation of state election laws demanded an investigation into the 2020 election. After all, this is a duty that Congress has been given and a lawful way to challenge concerns with state electors. As prescribed by the 12th Amendment, a joint session of Congress is to meet to “count electoral votes” and make a final determination on the 2020 Presidential Election. The Electoral Count Act of 1887 gives Congress the opportunity to object to any state where any member believes votes were either “unlawfully certified” or “not regularly given.” That is what I did today, and what many before me have done - including in recent elections.
Make no mistake, no one-person or chamber has unilateral power to overturn election results – not Congress, not the Vice-President, and not the President. I said before, the decision we have before us was not binary - it was not founded in overturning an election, but grounded in securing free and fair elections and protecting election integrity. Congress and state legislatures have an obligation to provide restored confidence to the tens of millions of Americans who have lost faith in our election process.
The actions of the mob that participated in storming the Capitol, fighting Capitol Police, and harming civilians and property is un-American and a disgrace to our republic. Those who broke the law and participated in this effort should receive maximum punishment. These actions undermine our very foundation – I didn’t fight for our country for forty years to see us devolve into settling political disputes by violence and intimidation. 

We are a nation of law and order and must remain so if we are to maintain our republic.

Defending the Constitution
Voting on States' Electoral Votes
 
  
Dear Fellow Texan,
 
I took an oath to our nation and the Constitution when I volunteered for the Marines and when I was first sworn in to represent Collin County in Congress in 2019. On Sunday, I took this oath again as a returning member of the House of Representatives for the 117th Congress.
 
As a constitutional conservative, I have always considered our founding document to be my North Star when deliberating public policy. Our founding fathers intentionally created a republic separating the national and state governments, known as federalism. This principle prevents the federal government from gaining too much control and protects the people from a powerful, centralized government.
 
In accordance with the Constitution, I will vote to accept the electoral votes certified by every state.
 
The 117th Congress began with a constitutional debate unlike any in recent history. I know good friends and respected conservatives, all loyal to the Constitution and our Republic, who interpret the matter on both sides. However, in forming my decision, I carefully examined the Constitution, the Federalist Papers, and the Electoral Count Act, which define the Electoral College process. These texts clearly grant the power to appoint electors to the respective states without needing approval from the federal government. Consistent with the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution, power not delegated to the federal government by the Constitution rests with the respective states.
 
This view, shared by stalwart conservatives like Senators Mike Lee, Tom Cotton, and many conservatives in the House, including my Texas classmate, Congressman Chip Roy, is further supported by historical precedent.
 
The founders emphatically objected to a parliamentary system, in which the legislative body selects the executive. This view was so ardently held, the Constitution explicitly prohibits members of Congress from serving as electors.
 
By objecting to electors, Congress would essentially establish veto power over a state’s electoral votes, mutating the process to elect our president into an ad hoc parliamentary hybrid. With such precedent, members of Congress could object for any reason, further distorting the Constitution to fit the political whim of the moment. For example, this precedent could allow Congress to object to Texas’ electoral votes because our state added an extra week of early voting during the COVID-19 pandemic without legislative approval. More cynically, liberal members of Congress who oppose Texas’ voter ID laws could move to throw out our electors. It only takes a few iterations until our Republic becomes a Parliamentary government.
 
The Constitution directs Congress to defer to the judgment of the states. Importantly, at the time of the vote, not a single state legislature formally, or informally, called on Congress to object to their electors. Notably, five of the six states in question are led by Republican legislative majorities.
 
Like so many Texans, I am disappointed in the 2020 presidential election, both in the outcome and for the manner in which it was conducted in some jurisdictions across the country.
 
My decision against objecting to state electors runs counter to my immediate political objectives. I campaigned and personally contacted thousands of voters in Collin County in support of President Donald Trump and our Republican ticket. Quite frankly, like many Texans, I am anxious for the future of our country.
 
Despite Speaker Nancy Pelosi commanding the smallest majority in over two decades, the socialist wing of the Democrat Party has already effectively taken over the agenda within the House of Representatives. As we await final election results from Georgia, it appears Senate Democrats may take the majority, and a self-declared socialist would likely chair the Senate Budget Committee. President-elect Joe Biden shows little willingness to stand up to the radical left, and instead, signals he will join their efforts to raise taxes, strip Americans of their freedoms, and transfer even more power from the people to a centralized big-government state.
 
As a Marine, I fought to defend our freedom abroad. Here at home, fair elections form the core of our democracy and both political parties should seek a credible and trustworthy election process. With the adoption of mass unsolicited mail voting, the abolishment of several election security safeguards, dismissal of vote irregularities, and a laissez-faire attitude toward voter fraud, millions of Americans have lost confidence in our election process. The American people deserve to have their questions answered.
 
For my part, I will continue to fight to protect our liberty from those who wish to transform America into a socialist nation. We stand at a critical crossroads and our actions now, and in the coming years, will influence the future of our nation. I embrace this reality and the challenges ahead and I will work to overcome these obstacles with the Constitution guiding my path.
 
                                                        Semper Fi,

1/6/21 13:02,Updated Economic Impact Payments (Stimulus),"￼

 
Updated Economic Impact Payments
(Stimulus Payments)
 
 
 
Dear Friends,
 
The IRS and the Treasury Department began issuing a second round of Economic Impact Payments (EIP), often referred to as stimulus payments, last week.  
 
The IRS emphasizes that there is no action required by eligible individuals to receive this second payment. The payments are automatic, and people should not contact their financial institutions or the IRS with payment timing questions. Instead, you can check the status of both your first and second payments by using the Get My Payment tool, available in English and Spanish on the IRS.gov website.
 
Some people will receive the EIP/Stimulus payment via direct deposit, while others will receive a paper check or debit card sent through the mail in January. The IRS urges people to carefully check their mail to ensure that the mailed checks or debit cards are not inadvertently discarded. Please know that mailed payments will require more processing and mailing time and those citizens who live abroad will have longer wait times for checks, as disruptions to air travel and mail delivery in some countries will slow delivery.
 
I've added a page on my website, Adams.House.gov, that includes additional information about the Economic Impact Payments and resources available through the IRS.
 
And remember: wear your mask, wash your hands and stay 6ft apart!
 
Sincerely,
￼
Congresswoman Alma S. Adams, Ph.D.

1/6/21 12:52,Now Law: Baldwin’s Bipartisan Bill to Support the Health and Wellbeing of Family Caregivers,"

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
Following unanimous passage by the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives, Senator Baldwin’s bipartisan Lifespan Respite Care Reauthorization Act has now been signed into law. Authored by Senators Baldwin and Susan Collins (R-ME), as well as by Representatives Jim Langevin (D-RI) and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA), this bipartisan legislation will support the health and wellbeing of family caregivers by authorizing $10 million annually for the Lifespan Respite Care program from fiscal year 2020 through fiscal year 2024.  
“Every day, family caregivers in Wisconsin and across our country tend to the needs of their loved ones,” said Senator Baldwin. “Although this work can be very rewarding, it can also be emotionally and physically challenging. I’m proud my bipartisan legislation with Senator Collins has now become law. Together, we’re going to help ensure continued funding for the Lifespan Respite Care Program so that our family caregivers can access the support and relief they need.” 
Supporters of Senator Baldwin’s bipartisan Lifespan Respite Care Reauthorization Act shared: 
“The COVID-19 pandemic has spotlighted the struggles of family caregivers and exacerbated the caregiver workforce crisis. Now more than ever, we need funding to cover costs to mitigate barriers to providing and accepting respite care, such as access and provision of PPE and the need for technological supports. Senator Baldwin really gets it, and we are grateful for her leadership and support of the Lifespan Respite Care Reauthorization Act,” said Lisa Schneider, Executive Director of Respite Care Wisconsin.   “Family and other unpaid caregivers play a critical and rarely recognized role in how our country cares for older adults,” said John Sauer, President/CEO of LeadingAge Wisconsin. “This legislation acknowledges their work and provides for essential respite services. During the pandemic, the burden on caregivers has grown, increasing their need for relief. Wisconsin’s aging services providers stand ready to help.”  “On behalf of family caregivers across the country, AARP thanks Senators Collins and Baldwin for their bipartisan work to extend the Lifespan Respite Care Program. Especially now in the middle of this pandemic, caregivers need respite services more than ever. We are thankful that this can help more families be able to take advantage of this much-needed relief,” said Bill Sweeney, Senior Vice President of Government Affairs for AARP.   “The National Respite Coalition applauds Representative Jim Langevin, Senator Susan Collins, Senator Tammy Baldwin, and Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers for championing the Lifespan Respite Reauthorization Act to final passage. The pandemic has exacerbated the social isolation and economic insecurity felt by family caregivers and their loved ones, with devastating effects on their health and wellness. Respite may be their only lifeline,” said Jill Kagan, Director of the ARCH National Respite Network.  “The Lifespan Respite Care Program, through very modest investments, allows states the flexibility and creativity to make sure family caregivers of children and adults are receiving quality respite services, even during COVID-19. The National Respite Network stands ready to work with its partners and with our Congressional champions to make sure the program is fully funded and implemented.” 
Respite care provides temporary relief to caregivers from their ongoing responsibilities. By protecting the health of caregivers, respite care decreases the need for professional long-term care and allows individuals who require care to remain at home. To date, 41 states have received funding through the Lifespan Respite Care program. The program provides competitive grants to states to establish or enhance statewide respite resources and help ensure that quality respite is available and accessible to all family caregivers. 
There are 53 million family caregivers in the United States that provide an estimated $470 billion in uncompensated care each year.  Read more about Senator Baldwin’s bipartisan Lifespan Respite Care Reauthorization Act of 2019 and see why 100 leading caregiver and respite organizations, including AARP, the ARCH National Respite Coalition, Autism Society of America, the Arc, and the National Alliance for Caregiving all endorsed the bill here.

Dear Neighbor, 
I hope your new year is off to a good start and that you are entering 2021 healthy and safe. Before we embarked on the new year, Congress passed another COVID relief package which I was proud to help negotiate through my Problem Solvers Caucus. This package included a new round of the Paycheck Protection Program with hundreds of millions in funds allotted for small businesses and non-profits still struggling with the economic setbacks from the COVID-19 pandemic. To answer your questions about this new round of relief, or perhaps your questions regarding loan forgiveness applications from the first round, I invite you to join me on Wednesday, January 13th from 8:30am PST to 9:30am PST for a small business webinar with representatives from the Small Business Administration and the Small Business Development Center. The webinar will be live from 8:30am to 9:30am and the video recording posted on my website afterwards. We are planning for a robust discussion to answer as many of your questions as we can.    Participants:  Representative Kurt Schrader (OR-05) Martin Golden District Director, Portland District Office, U.S. Small Business Administration  Robert Campbell Director, Clackamas Small Business and Development Center   Please sign up using the link here. Be sure to submit your questions through the link prior to the webinar.   If you have any questions prior to the webinar, please call my office toll-free at 1-877-301-KURT and we will connect you with a caseworker who can help. 
Sincerely,
￼

Congressional Report
 
 
 
 
Dear Friend,
 
I hope everyone had a safe and happy new year. It's been a busy start to 2021, but I'm excited to be working with my colleagues in the 117th Congress to pass legislation that will strengthen our nation and protect American families. 
 
 
This past Sunday, I was sworn into the 117th Congress and the House reconvened for legislative business on Monday. 
 
 
In the district, I held a press conference to provide an update on COVID-19 relief to ensure that the public has access to critical information and resources, like PPP and direct payments. Now more than ever, we need to work together in order to rebuild our economy and protect the health of our citizens. 
 
 
Finally, I want to take a moment to recognize the retirement of one of my Outreach Coordinator's, Gilbert Lafuente. Since 2005, Gilbert has served my office with pride and dignity, working every day to make sure that every public official and constituent felt both seen and heard. With over 165k miles driven, participating in over 780 staff meetings, and countless inspiring stories and experiences with individuals throughout our district, Gilbert has had quite the ride. Thank you for your service to the people of TX-28, and congratulations on reaching this major milestone.
 
As always, if you need assistance with a federal agency, please don't hesitate to reach out to one of my offices.


 
 
 
 
Rep. Cuellar is Sworn Into 117th Congress
 
￼
  
On Sunday, January 4th, I was sworn into the 117th Congress. I am honored to continue to represent Texas’ 28th in Washington for the next two years. A great deal of work lies ahead, but I remain steadfast in my commitment to working every day to advance the priorities of my constituents.
 
 
I will fight for the support that our families require as we continue to battle the COVID-19 crisis, including additional federal funding to ensure vaccines are distributed to every American. I will protect and expand affordable health care, particularly for the thousands of South Texans with pre-existing conditions. I will make sure every child has the opportunity to fulfill their American Dream by expanding college financial aid and making federal programs more available for students. I will work to implement strong and smart border security, which does not include an ineffective and wasteful border wall.
 
 
I am committed to working across the aisle to implement common-sense policies that make our families safer, our jobs more secure, and our nation more united. Now it's time for us to roll up our sleeves and get back to work on the issues that matter most to South Texas families. Let’s get to work.

'Conversation with Cuellar' Discusses COVID-19 Relief Updates
 
￼
  
On Wednesday, December 30th, I held a district-wide 'Conversation with Cuellar' where I discussed the coronavirus relief package and the CASH Act, legislation to increase the direct payments to $2000. 
 
 
While this legislation stalled in the Senate, many Americans have already begun receiving their $600 economic impact payments. However, there are still many anxiously awaiting their payments. If you have not received your payment, visit the Get My Payment portal to check your status. Furthermore, please visit IRS.gov for the most current information on the second round of payments rather than calling the agency or your financial institution.

On Wednesday, December 30th, my Outreach Coordinator, Gilbert Lafuente, presented a one-minute to Wilson County Commissioner Albert Gamez in honor of his retirement. Commissioner Gamez served the county for 19 years and his commitment to public service will be greatly missed. 
 
 
 
Fun Fact: Members of Congress are allowed to give one-minute speeches on the House floor about issues that are not about legislation or votes. Once the one-minute speech has ended, it remains a part of the Congressional Record.

We Will Object
 Last week, Rep. Jason Smith (MO-08), Rep. Sam Graves (MO-06), Rep. Vicky Hartzler (MO-04) and I announced that we would be objecting to the certification of electoral votes. Today, we will make our objections heard. Read our joint statement on why we are objecting below.
Next week, your 117th United States Congress will convene for the first time. After the election of Speaker and the adoption of the Rules of Congress, the action will quickly move to reading aloud the electoral votes submitted by each state from this past November's election - counting them, and declaring the vote tally for President and Vice President. During that process, the question will be put before your elected officials - does anyone object to the certification of electoral votes of a state. We will object. Our hope is that others will join us.
We don't take this decision lightly, but we must protect the integrity of each vote cast by every law-abiding Missourian. For every instance of Georgia failing to follow its own state law in verifying signatures, of Pennsylvania accepting mail ballots after the legal deadline set by its state legislature, or folks from outside Nevada casting a ballot in that state - the value of every Missourians’ vote is diminished. That's not right. And we cannot simply look the other way.
The right to freely cast your vote in elections is a sacred privilege afforded to us as Americans because of the sacrifices of the patriots who fought for that right. When that process is spoiled and abused by officials not following their own state law, it violates that right and jeopardizes the entire integrity and foundation of 'free and fair' elections. In such instances, where voting process changes are made without the consent of the voter, we know it is our duty and our obligation to serve as a backstop to protect the power of one person, one vote - to protect your vote as a Missourian. We must be able to have confidence in not only the agreement and expectation that this election would follow the law, but future ones will as well. We take the responsibility of upholding the Constitution seriously, and that is why we feel compelled to object to the electoral count taking place on January 6th. 
The reported results of this past November's Presidential election don't even pass the most basic eye test. Republicans were projected to lose seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, we gained more than a dozen. Republicans were supposed to lose control of several state legislatures, we picked up multiple. We were projected to lose control of the United States Senate - we didn't, and we won't. All of this occurred on the same night President Trump lost? It's hard to believe. Combined with the daily reports of voting irregularities where state election laws were discarded and not followed, something doesn't add up. President Trump won over 74 million votes, Obama - 69 million. President Trump won 2586 counties, Obama - 873 counties, Joe Biden - 527 counties. The numbers, the evidence, and the abnormalities all speak for themselves. 
We have joined lawsuits, called for a Special Counsel and demanded accountability and integrity, now we finally get to cast our vote. We have no illusions about the outcome, at the end of the day, this is still Nancy Pelosi's House. Our only hope is that more will join us - that more will value protecting the vote of every American living in their state as much as we do fighting for yours.

1/6/21 9:21,What to expect today,"￼
Dear Friend,
 
Normally, I reach out to keep you informed of important legislative developments that directly impact our district and our Commonwealth. Today, I’m emailing to provide you with a different kind of update – one that is not only important to each of us here in Massachusetts, but also to the very foundation of our Democracy.
 
As you’ve likely heard by now, the House and Senate will meet this afternoon to confirm President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris’ Electoral College victory. The count is normally a routine procedure required by the 12th Amendment following every presidential election, but that will likely change today.
 
It’s incredibly disappointing that dozens of my Republican colleagues have announced their intention to object to the count based on nothing more than election conspiracy theories that have no legal basis and no evidence whatsoever. More than that, their objections could jeopardize our ability to conduct free, fair, and trusted elections for years to come.
 
Make no mistake: Their objection will fail, and Joe Biden will be confirmed as the next President of the United States. But the damage they could do to our Democracy is very real.
 
That’s why, if you plan to tune in, it’s important you know what to expect:
	•	The House and Senate meet in a joint session at 1pm. The count will be presided over by Vice President Pence during which the results from each state, as certified by their respective election officials and voted on by their Electoral College electors, will be read aloud in alphabetical order.
	•	A challenge can happen during the reading of any state’s results, but federal law requires that at least one member of the House and the Senate must object in writing to a state’s results in order for the challenge to proceed.
	•	If a challenge on a state’s results proceeds, the House and Senate will have to adjourn the joint session and meet separately to debate and vote on the objection. Debate can last up to two hours, and this process must be repeated every time there is an objection. Right now, Republicans have indicated they could challenge the results of as many as six states.
	•	In order for a challenge to be successful, a majority in BOTH the House and Senate must vote to reject a state’s electoral votes.
	•	That won’t happen, but the process could take a while.
	•	Once the votes of all 50 states and the District of Columbia are announced and the challenges defeated, President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris will be declared the victors, finalizing the results of the election.
As you can see, it is a matter of when, not if the count will end with President-elect Biden’s victory being certified by Congress.
 
Alarmingly, that has not stopped the current President and a number of my colleagues from making it seem like the election can be overturned. It can’t. 
 
You, the voters, decide the outcomes of our elections, NOT Congress.
 
Rest assured, if Republicans in Congress move forward with their plans today to make a public display of their political fealty to Donald Trump and drag out this process, I and a majority of my colleagues in the House will vote to override their objections.
  
Warm regards,
￼

1/5/21 20:34,District Update: Entering the 117th Congress,"COVID-19 Update | January 5, 2021
View Email in Browser 
￼ 
Dear Friend,

On Sunday, I was sworn in to the 117th session of the United States Congress to represent the hard-working men and women of central Arkansas in the House of Representatives. I was blessed to have my wife and two children with me from central Arkansas to witness the ceremony.

While the next two years present us with many challenges, I look forward to working with colleagues from both sides of the aisle to craft commonsense solutions. Defeating the COVID-19 pandemic, creating new opportunities for small businesses to flourish, and ensuring our nation's health and safety should be markers of success for the new congress.

It is my honor, central Arkansas, to represent you in the 117th Congress!

￼

SPEAKER PELOSI SETS PARTISAN RULES FOR THE NEW CONGRESS

This week, Speaker Pelosi unveiled her rules package for the 117th Congress. These rules are yet another example of Speaker Pelosi’s desire to put the House Democrats’ far left agenda ahead of bipartisan common-sense solutions.

She would like to see Democrats’ progressive values dictate how Congress conducts its business.

The House of Representatives has always been a body open for debate. From health care to tax reform, Members of Congress are supposed to have the “great debates” of society on the House Floor.

Speaker Pelosi’s Rules package violates lawmakers’ First Amendment rights and attempts to silence House Republicans.

In previous years, House Democrats fought to remove God from our oaths. This time they are trying to stop the use of words like ""Mother."" If House Democrats were confident in their agenda or their ability to keep their party united, they wouldn’t be engaged in authoritarian efforts to silence free speech.

I voted against this rules package because it reduces our American values and creates a bias for House Democrats as we move into the 117th Congress.

￼


LOOKING BACK AT ACCOMPLISHMENTS IN 2020 


The past year has been trying and filled with difficult and unprecedented challenges. I was encouraged by our nation’s ability to come together to work on issues like the CARES Act and emergency funding.

We enter 2021 with bipartisan COVID-19 relief bills passed, FDA-approved vaccines, and a strong will to bring this pandemic to a swift end.

My team and I are proud to have helped provide:
	•	$9.25 billion in relief funding to our state to offset this virus’s negative economic impact,
	•	over 43,000 Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, totaling $3.3 billion,
	•	over $2.2 billion in Economic Impact Payments (EIP) to qualifying Arkansans.
	•	Aid to 222 central Arkansans with missing stimulus payments,
	•	over $400,000 in Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL).
To address current and future needs, Arkansas received $1.25 billion to provide expanded health care resources and promote our state’s economic recovery.  In addition to critical COVID relief legislation, my bill to honor the legacy of Arkansas civil rights champion Scipio Jones became law on December 3. This legislation will honor the legacy of Arkansas civil rights champion and lawyer, Scipio Jones, by hanging his portrait in the Little Rock Post Office that bears his name.  Through the hardships this recent year presented, I am proud of the work that my team and I accomplished for the hard-working men and women of Arkansas.   I thank all who interacted with my office and played an important role in joining with me to build a better Arkansas. 
In 2020, my team and I:
	•	Helped 838 central Arkansans with issues before the federal government
	•	Secured for Arkansas veterans over $3.7 million in benefits and money owed
	•	Supported $10 million in federal grants for Arkansas
	•	Sent 12,987,483 pieces of correspondence to keep you updated with the latest health and economic information.
I’m guessing many of you who read my weekly e-newsletter have had some type of contact with my office this past year; I sincerely thank you for your input.

Your perspectives and opinions help me do a better job serving you. The only way to solve the challenges we face is through constructive collaboration, and I am particularly grateful to our local leaders and elected officials who have worked with my staff and me to help Arkansas families.

VA RESUMES OVERPAYMENT NOTIFICATIONS TO VETERANS

Last week, the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) announced a nationwide plan to resume mailing notification letters to veterans for benefit overpayments that were placed on suspension from April 3, 2020, through January 1, 2021.

Collections on these payments were deferred to provide relief during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The VA has released a comprehensive plan to support veterans who will need assistance with overpayments. This includes extending repayment plans, waivers, compromises, and temporary hardship suspensions.

This plan can be found HERE.
The U.S Department of Veteran Affairs will pause collections through October 2021 for veterans who remain in financial hardship and have requested relief.  Any veteran or beneficiary with questions about benefit overpayments can submitted a request HERE or call 800-827-1238.  For health care co-payment debts, the Health Resource Center has more information found HERE or can be reached at 866-400-1238.


FORD DONATES MASKS TO PULASKI COUNTY SPECIAL SCHOOL DISTRICT 

 Last week, Ford Motor Company generously donated 36,480 masks to Pulaski County Special School District.  Inside and outside of the classroom, there is nothing more important than the safety of our students and of our teachers – and their families.  I am grateful for Ford’s generosity and for the Ford Next Generation Learning (Ford NGL) Project, which will help our students reach their career potential.  This donation will promote the well-being of students and faculty in central Arkansas schools, and it gives educators the ability to teach safely in the classroom.  
￼

Sincerely,
￼ 
Representative French Hill

1/5/21 20:16,Renewing Our Fight to Clean Up Washington,"
 
￼

 Dear Friend,  
Yesterday, I led the re-introduction of H.R. 1, the For the People Act, in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
H.R. 1 is a sweeping anti-corruption package to clean up Washington, protect and expand voting rights, restore integrity to government and put the needs and priorities of the American people ahead of special interests.  
My colleagues and I have made H.R. 1 our first priority this year because our democracy is in a state of deep disrepair. We witnessed it during the 2020 election, where Americans across the country had to overcome rampant voter suppression, gerrymandering and a torrent of special interest dark money just to exercise their right to vote. And we hear it from Marylanders like you and from Americans of all political stripes -- including Democrats, Independents and Republicans -- who are incredibly frustrated with the chaos, corruption and inaction that plague our politics and block progress on many efforts that benefit hardworking families.  
That's why House Democrats are doubling down on our longstanding commitment to advance transformational anti-corruption and clean election reforms by introducing and swiftly passing H.R. 1.  
Our historic reform effort will end decades of dysfunction in Washington, return power to the people and build a more just, equitable and prosperous country for all Americans. 
Key provisions of H.R. 1 include:  
	•	Expanding automatic voter registration and same day registration;  
	•	Strengthening vote by mail, early voting and ballot access;  
	•	Combating voter intimidation and voter suppression;  
	•	Protecting elections from foreign interference;  
	•	Fixing partisan gerrymandering;  
	•	Promoting digital ad transparency;  
	•	Forcing disclosure of dark money;  
	•	Reining in lobbyists and Washington insiders;  
	•	Empowering small donors against special interests and Super PACs; and  
	•	Enforcing ethics and conflict of interest rules for all government officials.  
See here to learn more about this once-in-a-generation reform package. 
 Sincerely,  ￼ John P. Sarbanes Maryland's Third Congressional District

1/5/21 18:38,Update on COVID-19 vaccine distribution in South Florida,"View In Browser 
￼

Dear Friend,
 
While I am hopeful for a healthier 2021 now that COVID-19 vaccinations are being distributed in South Florida, I know many are frustrated with how distribution has gone so far. I share your frustrations and have been pressing state and local officials to make public a comprehensive vaccine plan. While we must all be patient due to limited supplies, we should also expect a distribution plan with full transparency for all Floridians.
 
Recently, Governor DeSantis announced that Phase I of vaccine distribution will prioritize long-term care facility residents and staff; persons 65 years of age and older; health care personnel; and those deemed by medical experts to be extremely vulnerable to COVID-19.
 
County health departments and hospitals will be administering vaccinations to eligible candidates. Appointment hotlines have been overwhelmed with calls this week and some healthcare providers have had to halt reservations at this time. State officials have assured me that additional distribution sites will be announced soon.
 
Links to additional information are available below. 
 
Broward County: All appointments have been filled at this time. Please visit their website for more updates.  Palm Beach County: Florida Department of Health in Palm Beach County is providing COVID-19 vaccinations to residents 65+, healthcare providers, and those with serious preexisting conditions. To schedule an appointment, please email your name, phone number, and date of birth and include if you are 65+, a healthcare provider, or if you have a serious preexisting condition to chd50feedback@flhealth.gov.
 
Broward Health: Due to overwhelming demand, Broward Health has reached capacity through February 2021 for COVID-19 vaccinations. At this time, Broward Health is no longer scheduling new appointments. Please visit the website for updates
 Cleveland Clinic: All Cleveland Clinic locations have reached their vaccine supply limit and will no longer be scheduling appointments at this time. For more updates, click here.
 
Jackson Health: Vaccination appointments are no longer available at this moment. For updates, visit their website.
 
Holy Cross Health: COVID-19 vaccines are not currently being provided. Please visit their website or call 954-267-7600 for updates.
 
Memorial Health System: Memorial is now extending vaccines to seniors 65 and older and community licensed healthcare professionals regardless of hospital affiliation. Existing patients can sign up through their portal. New patients can call 954-276-4340 to schedule an appointment. Callers are asked to be patient due to the overwhelming volume of calls.
 As public health officials work to make vaccines widely available, please continue to be patient and follow social distancing guidelines. I will continue to work with state and local officials to ensure that Florida residents are kept updated on information regarding vaccine distribution. To find more information on vaccines or other COVID-19 resources, please visit Deutch.House.Gov/coronavirus or call my Boca Raton office at 561-470-5440.
 
Thank you,
 
Ted

Friend – 
Happy new year! Before 2020 gets too far into the rearview mirror, I wanted to take a minute to share with you my 2020 Year in Review report. The events of this year – a once in a century global pandemic, renewed calls for racial and social justice, and an election that polarized our country – have stretched everyone thin. But as I travel across Connecticut, I am heartened by the tenacity and generosity of our fellow citizens. That’s what makes the work I do in Washington so meaningful. 
I wake up every day with the people I represent on my mind, listening to your concerns and fighting on your behalf. This year, amidst the pandemic and partisan bickering, I was able to secure a bunch of big wins for our state. My legislative efforts this year were the result of countless conversations with the people of Connecticut – including you - and I hope this report is a reflection of that. 
Every best wish, 
Senator Chris Murphy

BROADBAND 
Take a Speed Test Here. 
The sad fact is that many places in West Virginia simply do not have access to reliable broadband and the lack of access affects West Virginians every day. Back in 2015, the FCC released a coverage map that stated 99.9% of Americans had wireless coverage. I knew then what I know now: That is just plain wrong. 
HOW MAY WE HELP YOU? 
To request assistance from my case team, click here.  As your U.S. Senator, I am proud to be your voice with government agencies during your time of need. My goal is for me and my staff to provide the best possible customer service for every West Virginian who contacts me needing assistance. While I have no direct jurisdiction in legal or administrative matters of any federal, state, or local agency, I welcome the opportunity to assist you in any way possible and to assure that full consideration is given to your case. See one of our success stories below: 
  
Ms. Freda Graham, from Weirton, contacted Senator Manchin for assistance with Veteran survivors benefits.  Freda’s husband passed away in early Spring 2020 and she had been denied survivor benefits from the VA.  As a result of Caseworker Kim Berry’s inquiry, Freda was granted survivor benefits backdated to June 2020. 
  
From the Hill to the Mountains
JANUARY 05, 2021: MANCHIN, CAPITO ANNOUNCE DAM REHABILITATION FUNDING IN MERCER COUNTY  Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $3,739,700 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to support the Supplemental Watershed Plan Brush Creek 14 in southern West Virginia. This funding is authorized by the Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Act and will help restore damage done to a flood control dam constructed in 1966 located in Mercer County.  ""Many areas of our state have been impacted by devastating floods over the years, taking precious lives, homes and livelihoods from our fellow West Virginians. Ensuring the safety of our people and businesses is and will continue to be a top priority of mine,"" said Senator Manchin. ""This funding will help address damage to the Brush Creek Watershed dam in Mercer County and ensure continued protection for countless homes and businesses. I am pleased the USDA has acknowledged the urgency of this repair and as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee I will continue to advocate for funding that helps our state manage our aging infrastructure."" 
JANUARY 04, 2021: MANCHIN STATEMENT ON WEST VIRGINIA NATIONAL GUARD CHANGE OF COMMAND  Charleston, WV – U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) today issued the following statement on the West Virginia National Guard Change of Command which signifies the transition of leadership from General James Hoyer to General Bill Crane.  ""The Change of Command ceremony held today signifies the end of General Hoyer’s leadership of the West Virginia National Guard and the start of General Crane’s time as the Adjutant General of the West Virginia National Guard. Since 1983, General Hoyer has served West Virginia and the United States admirably and I wish him and his wife Amy well in all their future endeavors. I look forward to working with General Crane in his new role as Adjutant General as he leads our brave servicemembers and wish Bill and his wife Jennifer luck as they take on this new role."" 
JANUARY 01, 2021:MANCHIN STATEMENT ON THE 15TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SAGO MINE DISASTER  Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) released the following statement ahead of the 15th anniversary of the Sago mine disaster.  ""Fifteen years ago, we lost twelve brave coal miners who went to work at the Sago mine and never returned home to their families. As a state, we came together after the tragedy to grieve the loss of our fellow West Virginians and support the families and loved ones of those lost. After the disaster, West Virginia worked hard to pass legislation that improved safety standards for our miners who mined the coal that made America the leader we are today. The Sago disaster anniversary reminds us that coal miners risk their lives every day to power our nation, and we must prioritize their health, safety, and security. I will continue to fight to make sure no family suffers this terrible loss ever again. Gayle and I will keep the families and loved ones of those twelve brave West Virginians in our thoughts and prayers."" 
JANUARY 01, 2021: MANCHIN VOTES TO OVERRIDE PRESIDENT TRUMP’S VETO OF DEFENSE BILL  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, voted to override President Trump’s veto of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The Senate voted 81-13 to override President Trump’s veto of the FY21 NDAA. Senator Manchin condemned President Trump’s reckless decision to veto the vital legislation last month.  ""I am relieved the Senate voted overwhelmingly today to override President Trump’s reckless and selfish veto of the NDAA. For over six decades, the NDAA has passed with overwhelming bipartisan support – proving that even in divisive times Congress can still come together to support our brave servicemembers and their families while also ensuring America and our allies are secure and protected. I want to thank my Democratic colleagues and most importantly my Republican colleagues for choosing country over party in overriding President Trump’s veto of this important legislation. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I will continue to fight for our servicemembers and West Virginia priorities to ensure our nation is protected from threats at home and abroad."" 
DECEMBER 30, 2020: MANCHIN VOTES TO MOVE FORWARD TO OVERRIDE PRESIDENT TRUMP’S VETO OF DEFENSE BILL  Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) voted to move forward in the process to override President Trump’s veto of the Fiscal Year (FY) 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The Senate voted 80-12 in favor of moving forward in the process to override President Trump’s veto. Senator Manchin condemned President Trump’s reckless decision to veto the vital legislation last week.  ""This evening, the Senate overwhelmingly voted to move forward in the process to override President Trump’s reckless and selfish veto of the FY21 NDAA. This is the first step in ensuring our servicemembers receive the support they need to protect America from threats at home and abroad. The NDAA has passed with overwhelming bipartisan support for six decades and while the override is not final yet, I am relieved the Senate can come together to support our servicemembers and their families and ensure America and our allies are secure and protected.""

My main concern continues to be monitoring the quality of care our Veterans receive at our West Virginia VAMCs.

We hope that next year we’ll be celebrating the holidays with our families and loved ones again.  ""During the Christmas season, Gayle and I are reminded of the importance of family - the source of life’s greatest joys and deepest bonds. I hope West Virginians create new traditions with their loved ones that keep us all safe and healthy. This holiday season, I encourage everyone to join us in praying for the safety of our fellow West Virginians, front line workers and healthcare professionals. My parents taught me that if you can count your blessings, you can share your blessings. As this year comes to a close, let us all reflect on our blessings and look forward to a healthy, happy, and safe New Year.""

Dear Neighbor,   
I’m honored and humbled to begin my second term representing the great state of Colorado in Congress, and deeply grateful to our community for giving me the opportunity to serve.
 
While our country faces multiple challenges, I truly believe we will rise to the occasion, and I am so ready to get to work!
 
Two years ago, Andrea and our daughter Natalie (who was only four-months old) joined me in Washington as I was sworn-in to the U.S. Congress for the first time. They were unable to join me for the start of the 117th Congress due to the pandemic, but we had a chance to speak over Facetime and we talked about what an incredibly meaningful, interesting, impactful and challenging few years it has been.

As we begin the 117th Congress, it's so important that I hear from you. Your concerns, ideas and perspectives are incredibly valuable as I work on your behalf.

Congressman Malinowski's First Term in Review
 
 
Since Tom was first sworn into Congress in January 2019, he and his staff have been committed to serving the constituents of New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District.
 
￼
 
Highlights from Tom’s first term in Congress include:
 
Constituent Casework: Since the start of his term Tom and his staff have opened over 5,000 casework requests from constituents and thus far have resolved over 3,600. Many of these requests come from constituents seeking help securing unemployment benefits and small business resources during the pandemic. 
 
The most effective way to reach out to the office regarding federal casework is by filling out the online casework form located here. If you are seeking assistance for an issue regarding unemployment benefits email nj07.casework@mail.house.gov. For issues regarding the Small Business Administration, including Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans, email nj07.smallbusiness@mail.house.gov. Please provide contact information and a detailed explanation of your case when reaching out. While we cannot guarantee you a favorable outcome, we will do our best to reach back out and help you receive a fair and timely response to your problem.
 
Connecting with Constituents: Tom has hosted over 70 virtual and in-person town halls and has attended over 350 public events around the district. The office has also held over 1,000 meetings with constituents since the start of the Congressional term, and completed over 64,000 letters, emails and phone calls.

Submit survey to sign up for updates on my work in Congress.* 
 
Though the offices in Somerville and in Washington, DC have suspended in-person activity, Tom and staff have continued to connect with constituents one-on-one in a variety of ways. To request a meeting with the Congressman or a staff member click here. The Congressman plans to continue to hold virtual events to engage with constituents amid the COVID-19 pandemic. To stay up to date on Tom's upcoming virtual events click here.
 
Supporting Local Small Businesses: Through the CARES Act and other legislation, Tom helped deliver more than $1.7 billion in forgivable loans to over 15,000 small businesses and non-profits in the 7th district, supporting over 140,000 jobs. For more information on the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans in the 7th District click here. 
 
In December 2020, Congress enacted a bipartisan COVID-19 relief bill which included an additional $284 billion to support small businesses across America through the PPP. Qualifying small businesses in New Jersey’s 7th Congressional District will have the opportunity to apply for a second round of this vital loan program. If residents of NJ-07 have any issues securing a PPP loan or need assistance with the Small Business Administration please email your contact information and the details surrounding your case to nj07.smallbusiness@mail.house.gov.   
 
Funding Secured: Since his first days in Congress, Tom has successfully fought for billions of dollars of federal funding to champion New Jersey’s priorities. These include:
	•	Portal North Bridge: Secured $248 million in Capital Investment Grants (CIG) funding for the Portal North Bridge - a key component of the broader Gateway Project.
	•	Fighting Domestic Terrorism: Secured over $35 million for Department of Homeland Security Programs to prevent domestic terrorism, including the Office of Targeted Violence and Terrorism Prevention (TVTP) grants. Tom led the effort to restore funding the Trump administration cut for this program in 2019, and championed additional funds this year, securing an increase of $21 million above FY20.
	•	Raritan River Basin Flood Risk Management Project: Advanced $157.4 million for the Raritan River Basin Flood Risk Management Project (Green Brook Sub Basin), which will be used to address the ongoing risk of severe storm-induced flooding in the area. 
	•	Frenchtown Sewer System: Supported local efforts to secure a $1,388,288 grant and a $1,590,000 loan from the Water and Waste Disposal Loans and Grants program to install a new gravity sanitary sewer system to each house in the Hilltop area of the Borough of Frenchtown.
Legislative Achievements: Throughout the 116th Congress Tom has introduced 22 bills, 5 resolutions, and has cosponsored over 500 pieces of legislation. Legislation introduced by Tom that has passed in the House of Representatives includes:
	•	Rahway River Flood Risk Management Feasibility Study: The Water Resources Development Act included a provision championed by Tom to require the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to expedite the completion of the Rahway River Flood Risk Management Feasibility Study, and to stay engaged with local leaders to determine and carry out the work necessary to prevent further flooding. This legislation was enacted into law as part of the 2021 government funding bill.
	•	Protect and Restore America’s Estuaries Act: Nearly doubles funding to improve the water quality and ecological integrity of some of America’s most important estuaries, including the New York-New Jersey Harbor & Estuary Program, which includes parts of the Raritan, Rahway, Elizabeth, and Hackensack Rivers. This legislation has passed the Senate and is awaiting President Trump’s signature.
	•	VA Serious Mental Illness Act: Requires the VA to establish a working group to review how the VA and its practitioners address mental, behavioral, and emotional disorders. This legislation was enacted into law as part of S. 785, the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act.
	•	Condemning QAnon and rejecting the conspiracy theories it promotes: A resolution Condemning QAnon, a movement promoting a collection of unfounded conspiracy theories that have spread widely on the internet since 2017.
	•	The Transportation Funding Fairness Act: Makes it easier for states to finance their portion of infrastructure projects, such as the Gateway project, that are jointly funded by federal and state governments.
	•	Fairness for Landowners Facing Eminent Domain Act: Reforms the Natural Gas Act to protect property owners facing eminent domain for the construction of pipelines.
	•	Providing Protective Equipment (PPE) Act of 2020: Ensures that the United States has a properly stocked and maintained Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to combat future health crises. The key provisions of this legislation were enacted into law as part of the 2021 government funding bill.
	•	Know the Price Act: Protects consumers by requiring health care providers and insurers to disclose the cost of procedures and services recommended to the patient. This legislation was enacted into law as part of the 2021 government funding bill.
	•	Corporate Transparency Act: Requires all companies registered in the United States to disclose their actual owners, closing a loophole that allowed foreign corrupt officials, criminals, terrorists, and tax evaders to hide their money in anonymously owned shell companies. This legislation was enacted into law as part of the 2021 defense bill.
Additional legislation introduced by Tom includes:
	•	Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act: Holds large social media platforms accountable for their algorithmic amplification of harmful, radicalizing content that leads to offline violence.
	•	Higher Education Student Protection Act: Holds institutions of higher education—including predatory for-profit colleges—accountable for spending disproportionately on advertising, marketing, recruitment, and lobbying relative to actual instruction.
	•	Expanding Health Care Options for Early Retirees Act: Allows retired first responders—including police officers, firefighters, and EMTs—to buy into Medicare beginning at age 50. 
	•	Natural Infrastructure and Resilience Act: Defines natural infrastructure in the FAST Act, and allows natural infrastructure projects to apply for U.S. Department of Transportation grants. 
The 117th Congress: As the 117th Congress begins, Tom remains committed to fighting for the priorities of New Jersey's 7th district. These priorities include:
	•	Additional COVID-19 relief, especially for our state and local governments.
	•	Prioritizing the affordability and accessibility of healthcare for all Americans as we continue to navigate this public health crisis.
	•	Working with the incoming Biden Administration to secure funding and approvals for the remainder of the Gateway Project, including for the Hudson River Tunnel.
	•	Fighting for the full restoration of our State and Local Tax Deduction (SALT).
	•	Continuing his work to hold large social media platforms accountable for their algorithmic amplification of harmful, radicalizing content that leads to offline violence by reintroducing the Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act. As well as advocating for the resources law enforcement require to effectively combat the national rise in domestic terrorism.
	•	Working with the incoming Biden Administration to defend American democracy at home and rebuild our moral leadership abroad.

CHARLIE CRIST
13TH DISTRICT, FLORIDA 



￼ 



215 Cannon House Office Building
Washington, DC 20515
(202) 225-5961

January 5, 2021
Dear Friend,
I pray this message finds you and your family safe and well. At the outbreak of this pandemic, I promised you, my bosses in Florida’s 13th Congressional District, that I would do all I can to help us get to the other side of this crisis. As we begin a new year, I remain just as fervently committed to that promise. 
As I’m sure you’ve heard, after months of negotiations, last month Congress passed a $900 billion coronavirus relief package to provide additional support to American families and businesses struggling from the pandemic, and to help expedite vaccine production and distribution.
The relief legislation contains a number of provisions that will provide meaningful help to our community, including:
	•	Providing another round of direct economic payments, $600 per individual and dependent; 
	•	Restoring federal unemployment assistance, with a $300 per week federal add-on and 11 additional weeks, through March 2021. Benefits for self-employed individuals, gig workers, and those who’ve exhausted state benefits have also been extended;
	•	Providing a $325 billion lifeline for small businesses, including $284 billion for a second round of forgivable Paycheck Protection Program loans and replenishing Emergency Injury Disaster Loan Advance Grants so small businesses in low-income communities can get the full $10,000.
	•	$15 billion in Save Our Stages relief for the live venues, theaters, and museums, providing much needed relief for the local live music and art venues that make our community so unique;
	•	Extending the federal moratorium on evictions through end of January 2021 and including $25 billion in rental assistance for families who owe back rent;
	•	Getting students safely back to school with $82 billion for K-12 public schools, and colleges and universities, including ventilation and HVAC upgrades to keep kids in school and safe;
	•	Taking steps to eradicate COVID-19, with $20 billion for the purchase of vaccines so every person who wants a vaccine can receive one for free, plus billions more for testing and contact tracing so we can get back to normal as soon as possible.
While it took too long to pass and I supported more robust relief, this bill is one of the largest relief packages in American history – second only to the CARES Act we passed in March. This emergency aid focuses on some of the most immediate needs in our community.
The legislation also includes all 12 government funding bills I’ve been working on as a member of the powerful House Appropriations Committee, keeping our government working for you, and protecting Pinellas residents from the threat of a government shutdown.
Here are just some of the wins we secured that will benefit Pinellas County:
	•	$25 million for Veteran Treatment Courts to give veterans in need access to treatment instead of jail time, supporting my Veteran Treatment Court Act, which was signed into law in August.
	•	$13 million to research red tide and other harmful algae blooms, an increase of 30% from 2019;
	•	$1 million for a new program to detect and monitor harmful algae blooms, like red tide, in the Gulf of Mexico so we can better prepare for and respond to algae outbreaks;
	•	Continued funding for Community Health Centers like those in Clearwater, Largo, and St. Pete through 2023, to provide low- and no-cost healthcare for our neighbors in need;
	•	$270 million plus a historic $3 billion emergency COVID allocation for the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund, which provide affordable, accessible capital to low-income families, communities of color, and small main street businesses that are typically shut out by big banks. 
I’ve always believed a budget is a statement of our priorities as a nation, and for me there is no bigger priority than hearing from my neighbors in Pinellas on what matters most to them – and delivering on those issues. 
As we look towards what I pray will be the end of this pandemic, I ask that you continue to be safe, social distance, wear a mask, and follow the advice of public health experts. Please know that I will continue to do whatever it takes to lift our community and nation out of this pandemic, and I will never stop fighting for you.
Stay safe and God Bless,,

Click here if you have trouble viewing this email 
￼
  

Dear Friends,
 
As the new session of Congress began on Sunday, I overheard two of my Republican colleagues, including one new member, strategizing about the upcoming charade that more than half of House Republicans are participating in to try to discredit the presidential election. Listening to them detail this assault on democracy left me with a sinking feeling and served as a profound illustration of the challenges that we face.
 
Not only do facts not matter to them, but the fundamental principle of democracy is clearly at risk when these people continue efforts to reverse a democratic election, even when the outrageous lies are disputed by their own long-established leaders past and present.
 
It’s important that Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger held firm against the latest outrageous example of Trump's interference in the election. It's all the more telling that Raffensperger is a Republican who presided over three separate recount efforts in Georgia.
 
He is joined by former Speaker Paul Ryan, who warns that this is an extraordinarily dangerous, anti-democratic and as he said, anti-conservative act. I am also pleased that Liz Cheney, the third-ranking person in the Republican House hierarchy, sent a 21-page memo warning that this plan would set a dangerous precedent, enabling Congress to choose the president. But we should make no mistake. With well over 100 Republicans – more than half their total membership – signing on to Trump's effort to overturn the democratically elected president, this division exposes the consequences of Republican control.
 
If Kevin McCarthy were Speaker, and the Republicans had the majority, there is no doubt in my mind that there would have been an unprecedented effort to overturn the election, and they may actually have succeeded.
 
There isn't even a pretext for supporting our democracy. There is no respect for law and for facts. Every single one of more than 60 court challenges, except a tiny minor decision, has ruled the Republican fantasy based on lies, misrepresentation. Tellingly, when Trump's lawyers have to be in court and tell the truth under punishment of perjury, the evidence of wrongdoing evaporates and we're left with conjecture and wishful thinking on their part. 
 
This all illustrates the high stakes for the future of our democracy, and how narrow a thread we have protecting it.
 
It is the Democratic majority in the House and the new Joe Biden administration that's going to be responsible for us to get back on track. Our task is threefold.
 
We must fight with all our strength to protect the integrity of the political process, calling out the lies and fighting efforts to undermine democracy whenever they emerge. Soon, Trump will have no claim to immunity. He should be investigated by Georgia and other states. If a crime was committed, he and his enablers should be arrested and prosecuted.
 
At the same time, we must continue our legislative work in the House, guided by facts and the priorities of the American people. From tackling the climate emergency to addressing the looming eviction crisis to defeating this pandemic, there’s so much to get done with the new president, and any Republican who wishes to deal with reality.
 
Third, we must redouble our efforts to deal with the majority of Americans who are willing to deal with reality. It's clearly not everybody, given the 25% of the people who are susceptible to Trump's lies, but there are people we must bring into the fold.
 
The stakes have never been higher, the tactics never clearer, and our job never more important.
 
Courage,
￼

Info on Second Round of Stimulus Checks
 
 
Dear Friend,
 
Millions of Americans are struggling, and this pandemic has forced many out of work – with the risk of losing their homes or being able to afford life’s necessities. These economic impact payments are critical in helping alleviate stress for working families across my district as well as the nation. 
The IRS has announced that the distribution process to American taxpayers has begun. While many Americans have already received their economic impact payments, there are still many anxiously awaiting their payments. The IRS is working diligently to ensure that payments of $600 per person and $600 for qualifying children and dependents are being distributed swiftly and accurately.
I want to emphasize that there is no action required by eligible individuals on these second round of payments, it’s automatic. All payments are expected to be distributed by the end of January. Furthermore, please visit IRS.gov for the most current information on the second round of payments rather than calling the agency or your financial institution.

￼


Fellow Illinoisan,   On Sunday, I was sworn in to my fifth term as a U.S. Senator representing Illinois.  I had the privilege of being escorted to the ceremony by my good friend and colleague, Senator Tammy Duckworth.  It is an honor that the people of Illinois have given me the opportunity to continue to represent them in Washington.
￼
DURBIN HONORED TO REPRESENT ILLINOIS IN FIFTH TERM AS U.S. SENATOR 
During my time in the Senate, I have worked to create good-paying jobs, promote Illinois businesses, fight for marginalized communities, and ensure that our state is receiving its fair share of federal funding. I look forward to continue fighting for Illinoisans in my next term.    The last four years did not break America, but revealed what was already broken. In this new Congress, I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help heal some of the painful wounds of our nation’s past, and together, create a better, more just, more prosperous America for all.   Thank you for sending me back to Washington for my fifth term. It is the honor of a lifetime to be the longest-serving, popularly-elected Senator from Illinois. I will never stop fighting for you.    Sincerely,    U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL)

Lindsey, 

Over the past four years President Donald Trump has kept his promise to shake up Washington and bring positive change to our country. Because of his leadership and the dedicated work of Congress, American families are paying less in taxes. The pre-COVID-19 economy was setting historic records, to the benefit of hard working Americans of all races, colors, and creeds. Our military readiness and deterrence of our adversaries in pursuit of peace have been restored. And more than 220 conservative judges have been confirmed to lifetime appointments on the federal bench – including 21 in Texas, and three outstanding Supreme Court Justices. 

Perhaps our greatest achievement, though, was our bipartisan work to begin to lead our country out of the COVID-19 crisis through the development of two successful vaccines and life-saving therapeutics. Through the admittedly dark days of this pandemic, the President and Congress were determined to fight and win the two-front war – public health and economic – against this virus. More remains to be done, for sure, but we have come a long way together and there is reason for hope and optimism. 

So many successes, almost too many to name, happened in spite of the fact that from the beginning of his presidency, President Trump has had the kitchen sink thrown at him by his critics. His opponent and prominent members of Congress refused to even acknowledge the legitimacy of his election. Then there were the now-debunked Russian collusion charges, a two-year Special Counsel investigation, illegal domestic surveillance by James Comey’s FBI as a result of lies to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, and the third-ever impeachment trial against a sitting president – ending in his acquittal by the Senate. 

Where did the idea of questioning the legitimacy of an election come from? One thing is certain: it didn’t begin with President Trump. Our Democratic colleagues established the precedent we now find ourselves following, for better or worse. 

Both the President and I were on the Texas ballot in November, and I was honored to receive his endorsement and campaign with him. The President and I both won, with more votes than any candidate for President or Senate has ever received in the Lone Star State. But, as we know, the election results weren’t as decisive elsewhere. 

From record numbers of mail-in ballots due to COVID-19, to incredibly close margins in a number of states, the results were too close to call on election night. In the following days, allegations of fraud, wrongdoing, and other apparent irregularities created even more confusion and distrust in the outcome. 

When media outlets called the election for Joe Biden, I said that recounts and legal challenges needed to play out before a winner could be determined. I felt strongly that the President and his campaign were entitled to pursue their legal remedies, and that’s precisely what was done. 

President Trump’s legal team filed numerous lawsuits challenging the election outcome. But none of the legal arguments or evidence presented by the President’s legal team convinced the more than 50 state and federal courts that sat in judgment. Every single lawsuit was ultimately rejected, some on the merits, some on procedural grounds, both equally dispositive. These lawsuits were heard by well-respected jurists – many of whom were nominated by President Trump himself. Appeals ensued in some cases, but the President’s team ultimately came up empty-handed. 

This brings us to the solemn constitutional duty before the Senate tomorrow, when Congress will convene to certify the results of the Electoral College. Some of my colleagues in the House and Senate have stated their intent to object during the certification process in order to shine a light on allegations of fraud and other irregularities. 

Just as I have supported President Trump’s right to pursue legal remedies following the election, I support the right of my colleagues to challenge one or more states’ electoral votes. These challenges deserve to be heard, debated, and voted on, just as similar objections have been considered in the past. As recently as 2005, a Democratic Senator objected to the certification of election results in Ohio. Moreover, despite the heated rhetoric about this process, invoking one’s rights as set out in the Constitution and laws of the United States does not threaten to harm our democracy. 

These challenges must be decided on the merits and nothing else. The Constitution and federal law give us a roadmap to follow and we should follow it. But allegations alone will not suffice. Evidence is required. 

One final point of agreement and one of disagreement. I believe the call for an independent commission to examine the irregularities during this election is an excellent start. The Commission on Federal Election Reform, otherwise known as the Carter-Baker Commission, provides an obvious, useful precedent. As to timing and practicality of an emergency audit, I am much more dubious. The design of the proposed commission to conduct such an “audit” will inevitably fail. 

First, Inauguration Day is set by the Constitution to occur in roughly two weeks. It cannot be changed, even by an act of Congress. Second, such a commission would require the support of the House of Representatives where Speaker Pelosi and Democrats have a majority. They will not support such a commission, believing that former Vice President Biden and Senator Harris have won the election and should be inaugurated on January 20th. 

As a former judge, I view this process with the same impartial, evidence-based decision-making as I did my job on the bench. Over these past two months, I have paid close attention to the legal challenges and recounts that have taken place across the country. As mentioned, every lawsuit filed by the Trump campaign has failed to change the outcome. And multiple states have conducted recounts to confirm the results – in Georgia, three times. So, unless substantial, new evidence is presented during the challenges to each state’s ballots, I will not object to the certification of that state’s election results based on unproven allegations. 

Members of Congress are entitled to vote any way they wish and are accountable to their constituents for that vote, but a vote not to certify the electoral votes of a state based on an emergency audit that is designed to fail is not a vote on the merits. It is not a vote based on evidence. 

To state the obvious, I – along with millions of Texans – hoped President Trump would be elected to a second term. I had high hopes for everything we could accomplish under President Trump’s leadership over the next four years, and to say the least, I am disappointed by the election results. Any one person’s disappointment, however, cannot and should not override the legitimate votes of millions of Americans and our duty to uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States. Doing so would be a violation of my oath, do irreparable harm to our great democracy, and set a dangerous precedent for future elections. 

It is an honor to continue to represent you in the United States Senate. Be assured that I will continue to honor my oath of office and do my duty as God gives me the light to see it. 

For Texas,
John Cornyn

Kansas Common Sense  January 4, 2021
Hello,  Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them. 
  
Happy New Year 
Throughout the year, I had the opportunity to hear from thousands of Kansans across the state, both in person and virtually, and I am extremely grateful for all of our discussions and your insight on the many issues our country continues to face.  I am also reminded of one of the most important jobs my office does: helping Kansans navigate and resolve issues with federal agencies through casework. This year, we assisted more Kansans than ever before due to the COVID-19 pandemic by helping small businesses navigate the Paycheck Protection Program, individuals receive stimulus checks, veterans needing access to their health benefits and health care providers receive additional PPE.  Please don’t hesitate to reach out to my office if we can be of any assistance regarding Social Security, Medicare or veterans’ affairs, or if you have other concerns regarding federal issues. Learn more on my website here.  Robba and I are praying for your health and wellbeing and wish you a Happy New Year.

Creating Long-Term Solutions for Quivira National Wildlife Refuge 
This week, I was pleased to announce that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) will not request to secure water in 2021 to remedy the water impairment at the Quivira National Wildlife Refuge. This demonstrates the continued commitment of the FWS to work towards fulfilling the water needs of both the refuge and local producers. This summer, water management discussions between my office, the FWS and the Big Bend Groundwater Management District No. 5 (GMD5) leadership led to a Memorandum of Agreement between FWS and GMD5. Through a grant secured for watershed planning at Rattlesnake Creek and the partnership of FWS Director Aurelia Skipwith, we are on track to establish long-term solutions that will support the refuge, Kansas producers and the regional economy. Thank you to Director Skipwith and the GMD5 leaders, including Orrin Feril and Darrell Wood, that helped make this possible.  Read more about this decision here in The Hutchison News. 
  
Speaking with Kansas Veteran Leaders 
I hosted a conversation with veteran advocates throughout Kansas to discuss issues that are important to veterans and how I can continue to support those who served in uniform during the 117th Congress convenes in the New Year. As the chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I appreciate these opportunities to hear directly from veterans, so I can take their concerns and ideas to our nation’s capital.  We had an honest and productive conversation that spanned a wide variety of topics. My bill to improve access to mental health care and services for veterans, the Commander John Scott Hannon Veterans Mental Health Care Improvement Act, was signed into law in October and will invest in community-based veteran organizations and alternative therapies to support veterans who are struggling with mental illness. Addressing veteran suicide continues to be one of my top priorities. It is reassuring to know that so many Kansan veterans are coming together to support their brothers and sisters in arms, and I look forward to working with them to support veterans in need.  Other items of interest to Kansas veterans included building a strong community care network through the MISSION Act, supporting veteran caregivers, improving access to care for those who were exposed to toxic substances, and connecting newly-separated veterans with the VA so they can receive the care and benefits they have earned.  My work as chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee will continue to center on helping veterans achieve success after service, and I look forward to working with veterans and advocates in the new Congress to achieve this goal.

MOMS Leave Act Becomes Law 
Last week, Congress passed landmark defense legislation that included two of my bills to support and honor our nation’s servicemembers. The law supports our military personnel by authorizing a well-deserved three percent pay raise, investing in critical technologies and providing critical resources to help military families thrive. Two of my bills, the MOMS Leave Act and the FIRST Act, were included in the bill and became law.  The Mothers of Military Service Leave Act, or the MOMS Leave Act, will provide women serving in the National Guard and Reserve with maternity leave benefits that are equivalent to their active-duty counterparts. Previously, new mothers serving in the National Guard and Reserve Components did not have access to maternity leave benefits. This forced them to juggle their responsibilities as a new mother with their military service and often had negative impacts on their compensation or retirement points. My bill will allow new mothers to take the equivalent of six weeks of maternity leave without having to worry about their finances or points toward creditable military service.  Another one of my bills, the FIRST Act, will allow the names of fallen Big Red One soldiers to be added to the First Division Monument that is located on the White House grounds. My bill will allow the names of 1st ID soldiers who were killed in action during Operations Desert Storm, Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom and New Dawn to be added to the monument at no cost to the American taxpayer. These soldiers paid the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our nation, so it is only fitting that we honor their service in our nation’s capital.  There is no group that I hold in higher regard than our nation’s service members. I will continue to support our military and provide them with the tools they need to defend America and her interests. 
  
Checking in with Law Enforcement in McPherson County 
This week, I joined a zoom call with city officials and local law enforcement from McPherson County to discuss the daily challenges they are facing and how federal resources can best be accessed to help them overcome these challenges. I would like to thank all of the participants for taking the time to have this conversation, as these firsthand accounts are valuable to me while working for Kansas in Washington, D.C.  As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee which funds the Department of Justice (DOJ) and its grant programs, I was happy to share that in this year’s bill I was able to secure increases for existing grant programs, including the Byrne-JAG program, COPS Hiring program, and programs that support the purchase of bulletproof vests and body-worn cameras. Furthermore, I was able to ensure that a portion of these funds must go to rural departments to guarantee our small communities are able to access these grants. Our law enforcement professionals put their lives on the line every day to keep our communities safe, and I will continue to work with my Senate colleagues and the DOJ to ensure they are equipped with the resources and tools they need. 
  
￼ 
  
Meeting with Shawnee City Officials 
On Monday, I spoke virtually with Shawnee city officials. We discussed a number of federal resources that help the Shawnee community, such as Community Development Block Grants and support from the CARES Act to aid in responding to the pandemic, including the purchase of necessary PPE.  As chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Department of Justice (DOJ), I was also pleased to hear that a DOJ Byrne-JAG grant helped the city hire five additional police officers. Thank you to City Manager Nolan Sunderland and Assistant City Manager Caitlin Gard for the update. 
  
￼ 
  
Getting Acquainted with New JCCC President 
This week, I spoke with Johnson County Community College (JCCC) President Andy Bowne and Associate Vice President for Institutional Advancement and Governmental Affairs Kate Allen. Dr. Bowne took over as JCCC’s new president this summer, and I was pleased to hear of his efforts to make certain JCCC students still have access to a quality and affordable education during COVID-19.  I was also pleased to report that with the passage of the most recent federal relief package, JCCC will have more resources at their disposal to continue reaching students in the greater Kansas City metro area. Thank you to Dr. Bowne and Associate VP Allen for your time and the work you do on behalf of Kansas students.

Announcing $1.6 Million EDA Grant to PSU 
On Tuesday, I announced a $1.6 million grant to Pittsburg State University (PSU) from the Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration (EDA) to provide instrumentation and equipment to the newly established National Institute for Materials Advancement at the Kansas Polymer Research Center. The EDA grant, to be located in a Tax Cuts and Jobs Act Opportunity Zone, will be matched with $400,000 in local funds and is expected to create 50 jobs, retain 25 jobs, and generate $2 million in private investment. This investment by the EDA in Pittsburg State University will create local jobs and bring critical resources to our state as we work to recover from the economic impact of COVID-19 and will help ensure that PSU remains a national leader in polymer research. As chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, I will continue to support the ongoing and important work of the EDA to create economic opportunities in our communities, especially during the ongoing pandemic.

Legislative Work



I hope everyone had a happy and healthy holiday season. Over the past two weeks, I have been hard at work fighting for ways to help us all return to a more normal life in 2021. In this newsletter, I will provide a brief overview of the many provisions that I fought to have included in the COVID relief package and the government funding omnibus. For a more in-depth look into each of these, please sign up for my area-specific newsletters here.   What’s going on in Health Care?   The pandemic relief package provided $20 billion for the purchase of new vaccines, ensuring that anyone who wants an FDA-authorized vaccine can receive one free of charge. The legislation also provided $20 billion to help states with testing.   The package included provisions aimed at expanding telehealth access. In these uncertain times, many people do not feel safe outside of their home, and better access to telehealth gives our older and more vulnerable population greater opportunities for better healthcare.   Also in the package, The Better Tools for Healthy Living Act, which I authored and introduced last year, was also included, directing the Director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to create a guide for effective strategies to help states and localities ramp up their efforts to prevent and combat obesity.  Small Business   As a former small business owner myself, I know how important they are to our communities. The new pandemic relief package includes $325 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program, as well as funding for PPE and $20 billion for Economic Injury Disaster Loans. By increasing PPP funding, streamlining loan forgiveness, and setting aside specific amounts for community-oriented financial institutions, countless jobs will be saved and small business owners will have more security through the winter.  New in Education   Last Thursday, the President signed the HBCU PARTNERS Act into law. This law, which I wrote and introduced with a bipartisan group of my colleagues last year, will strengthen partnerships between HBCUs and federal agencies, which is a big win for the future of these vital institutions.   In the pandemic relief package, I made sure that school choice and educational opportunities were a priority. Money is being allocated to schools, both private and public, through the Governor’s Education Emergency Relief (GEER) Fund, to ensure that every student can return to a safe and clean environment.   In the government funding omnibus, I fought for the simplification of the FAFSA, the form that families complete in order to apply for financial aid to assist them in pursuing higher education. The package included a provision that will reduce total questions on the FAFSA from 108 to a maximum of 36, building on last year’s FUTURE Act. 
Thank you for staying updated on my work from week to week.  Don’t forget, you can sign up for all my issue-specific newsletters, in addition to my weekly update, here. Also, please remember to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube for regular updates on how I am serving the people of South Carolina here in Washington.

In case you missed it, KCRG covered my swearing-in ceremony, writing: “Ernst was sworn in by Vice President Mike Pence and joined by her daughter, Libby Ernst, and Libby’s fiancé, Andrew Maier…For the official swearing-in on the Senate floor, Ernst was escorted by Iowa’s Senior Senator, Senator Chuck Grassley. Ernst swore her oath of office on her grandmother’s Bible.”     I’m humbled and honored by the support of folks in every corner of our state, and I look forward to getting right back to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to continue serving Iowans.

Telephone Town Hall
I am honored to have the opportunity to serve West Michigan in the 117th Congress. One of my priorities this Congress is to continue to be transparent and engage with constituents during these challenging times. 

With that in mind, tomorrow evening, I will be hosting my next telephone town hall conversation with residents across West Michigan at 6:05 PM.                                                  

On December 16th, I held a town hall that generated an informative conversation following the November election. Tomorrow's conversation will surround the electoral college certification vote in Congress, potential challenges to those electors, and what happens next. 

This telephone town hall format will allow thousands of residents to participate via telephone as well as stream the conversation online. 
￼
If you haven't had the chance to participate in a telephone town hall, you can sign up to receive a phone call at Huizenga.House.Gov/live. If you don't want to join via telephone, the call will also stream live at this web address. I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow night!

 BEATTY BULLETIN Winter 2021

*Please click here to request a Beatty Bulletin by mail*



From Agony to Action: the Time is Now 

Our nation is facing three pandemics: Coronavirus (COVID-19), economic turmoil, and social injustice; and the only way we’ll solve these pressing issues is by listening more and screaming a lot less because we are all Americans first and foremost. 

Let’s pass another COVID-19 relief package so that no American is forced to go hungry or lose their job—let alone their home. Finding a compromise is vital for consumers, seniors, veterans, students, tea chers, schools, and entrepreneurs too. Economically, let’s close the wealth gap, raise the minimum wage, lay the foundation to build a brighter future for everyone, and improve access to affordable healthcare, housing, education, and jobs 

Finally, let’s find a path forward to stomp out systemic racism and ensure justice for the senseless killings of too many Black Americans. As Chair of the Diversity and Inclusion Subcommittee, I am also pushing a bill to overturn the Trump Administration’s harmful executive order terminating diversity and inclusion training and calling on the incoming Biden Administration to immediately rescind it. Further, I am working hard to pass comprehensive law enforcement reform legislation, and demanding that racism be declared a ‘national crisis.’ 

The road ahead won’t be without its challenges, but I’m confident we can defeat COVID-19, give anyone willing to work hard a fair chance at the American Dream, and begin to live up to the ideals of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all—not just the select few

Congresswoman Beatty addresses the nation during the ‘Commitment March: Get Your Knee Off Our Necks’ from the Lincoln Memorial with Rep. Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) and Rep. Andre Carson (IN-07) 
 

One Million Back to Constituents, One Billion in Investment

Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic, U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty’s (OH-03) district staff has seen a sharp rise in the number of people and families seeking assistance. Comparing 2020 to 2019*, the Office has experienced a 69 percent increase in new requests, completed 305 cases (248 in all of 2019), and recouped $1,026,625 owed to constituents. Additionally, as a result of Beatty’s support on a number of bills, Ohio’s Third Congressional District has received over $1 billion in federal funding and grants in 2020, including $487 million in COVID-19 relief, $18 million to The Ohio State University’s Center for Emergent Materials for medical and scientific technology and research, $12.98 million for the Child Development Council of Franklin County to fund Head Start and Early Head Start programs, and $4.9 million to National Church Residences to create affordable housing for seniors.

Combatting COVID-19 in Central Ohio

“Ohioans have gotten this virus under control in the past and we can do it again. It is critical that we follow the same precautions in our personal life with friends and family that we follow at work or at school: wear a mask, keep six feet from others who don’t live in your household, clean your hands routinely when you’re out in public, and avoid large gatherings. These are the steps that will get this pandemic back under control!” 

- Dr. Andrew Thomas, Chief Clinical Officer, The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center
￼
Ohio’s Third Congressional District was among the first locations in the country to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The initial batch of doses arrived at OhioHealth Riverside Methodist Hospital on December 15, 2020. Eight hospitals in Ohio received the vaccine. Pictured below, OhioHealth President of Riverside Methodist Hospital Robert Cercek, Dr. Joseph Gastaldo, Dr. Thomas Harmon, OhioHealth Foundation President Karen Morrison, and Ohio Lieutenant Governor Jon Husted hail the delivery of the COVID-19 vaccine and its life changing impact. 
￼
 

Safeguarding Your Vote and Mail Delivery 

Congresswoman Joyce Beatty is focused on safeguarding the constitutional right to vote and our mail service. To that effect, she held an August 28th press conference in front of the Oakland Park Post Office to call out the Trump Administration’s reforms impacting postal delivery and operations. In addition, Beatty teamed up with the entire Ohio Democratic Congressional Delegation to urge Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose to: (1) protect the health and safety of Ohio voters and poll workers; (2) locate additional ballot drop boxes across all of Ohio’s 88 counties; (3) comply with a court ruling ordering him to allow multiple ballot drop boxes; and (4) use his existing authority to prepay postage for absentee ballots and ballot applications. 

Of note, Beatty helped pass The Heroes Act twice out of the U.S. House of Representatives. The comprehensive COVID-19 relief package includes, among many other important funding priorities, $25 billion for the United States Postal Service to make up for lost revenue and to purchase personal protective equipment. Moreover, she introduced the Congressman John R. Lewis Election Day Act of 2020, H.R. 7820, to make the 2020 Election a national holiday in honor of Civil Rights icon Congressman John Lewis (GA-05) 
￼ 
 

Protecting Healthcare and Protections for Pre-Existing Conditions 

On November 10th, the United States Supreme Court heard oral arguments in a case that will determine the future of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) (P.L. 111-148), protections for pre-existing conditions, and healthcare coverage for newly insured and at-risk Americans. In Congress, Beatty has consistently voted to expand and strengthen the ACA and against every attempt to repeal the landmark law. Most recently, she joined a majority of her congressional colleagues to pass an amendment, added to appropriations legislation (H.R. 7617), to prevent the U.S. Department of Justice from spending any federal funds on lawsuits seeking to strike down the ACA. 

 

Remembering Justice Ginsburg and Congressman Lewis 

Serving in her official capacity as Representative of Ohio’s Third Congressional District, Congresswoman Joyce Beatty participated in the Lying in State ceremonies for former Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and former Congressman John Lewis. Like Ginsburg and Lewis, Beatty is an outspoken defender of civil rights and gender equality.  
￼ 
￼ 
 

Dedicating New Civil Rights Mural  

Congresswoman Joyce Beatty joined local artists Marcus Billingsley, AdaObinnia Ijomah and Lance Johnson to unveil “HeART of Protest” at the King Arts Complex on November 7, 2020. The wall mural pays tribute to local and national Black leaders who dedicated their lives to or even lost their lives in the ongoing struggle for civil rights like Aminah Robinson, Mayme Moore, John Lewis, and Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. During the ceremony, Beatty said,“Standing on the shoulders of these brave Americans, I continue to work to guarantee equal justice, ensure transparency and accountability from law enforcement, and create safer, stronger neighborhoods for all Americans.”

COVID Relief for All Americans

During the first round of COVID relief, U.S. Citizens and Legal Permanent Residents were excluded from receiving payment if married to a foreign national with no legal status in the U.S. In June, I introduced the Economic Impact Payment Fairness Act to address this discrepancy within the CARES Act because there is no reason to justify why a U.S. Citizen or Legal Permanent Resident should be excluded from receiving a benefit meant for Americans simply due to the legal status of a spouse. I am thrilled to see that this provision was taken into consideration in this new COVID relief bill, and I look forward to seeing the great impact this will make in helping the American people. 
 

FY2021 Funding for our Nation

The funding bill signed into law on December 27, 2020, includes big wins for our nation and for Florida. This bill prioritizes funding to enhance our infrastructure, support our military and law enforcement, and strengthen our national security. In addition, school safety remains a top priority, Everglades Restoration receives a significant influx of funding, and programs that our farmers and growers rely on will continue. It also supports critical housing programs such as the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) and Homeless Assistance Grants. Attached to this bill are several legislative priorities, including an end to surprise billing— patients will now know the real cost of a scheduled procedure before it takes place. Additionally, this bill includes the final version of WRDA 2020, thereby ensuring the Moore Haven Lock and Dam is renamed in honor of fallen FWC Officer Julian Keen, Jr.

As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, I was successful in including the following items in the 2021 appropriations omnibus.

1/4/21 14:16,"Bergman, Walberg to Object to Certain Presidential Electors on January 6th","￼ 
  

Bergman, Walberg to Object to Certain Presidential Electors on January 6th 
 
Washington - Today, Rep. Jack Bergman (MI-01) and Rep. Tim Walberg (MI-07) announced they will formally object during the Electoral College certification process on January 6, 2021. Since Election Day, constituents have demanded Congress launch a full investigation into potential fraud and election irregularities and ensure election integrity measures are enacted.
The Members stated, “The very foundation of our Democracy lies in the tenets of a free, fair, and secure election. Americans deserve to know only legal votes are counted and reports regarding irregularities, fraud, and failure to follow election laws are thoroughly investigated. Poll challengers have raised valid concerns about election integrity across our Nation that brings into question the results of the 2020 election and puts faith in future elections in jeopardy.
“While the easy answer is ignoring election irregularities – we will not stand idly by without taking every lawfully available option to ensure the outcomes of our elections can be trusted. This includes objecting to the electoral votes from disputed states where there is evidence warranting an investigation.  ""Our options are not binary - Congress has an obligation to the tens of millions of Americans who have lost faith in our election process to prove that our elections are free, fair, and follow laws in place. We join with our Senate colleagues calling for an Emergency Electoral Commission to perform an emergency audit of the election results in the 10 days before the inauguration.""
Objecting during the certification process is not an unprecedented action and was done as recently as 2017 when seven Democrat Members of Congress (Reps Jim McGovern, Barbara Lee, Sheila Jackson Lee, Raul Grijalva, Pramila Jayapal, Jamie Raskin, and Maxine Waters) objected to the 2016 Presidential election.
Additionally, in 2005, 31 House Democrats objected to the counting of Ohio's electoral votes in the 2004 presidential election claiming widespread irregularities on Election Day. 
In states across the country, irregularities have been brought to light since Election Day, including:
In Arizona - Plaintiffs contest that over 75,000 absentee ballots were reported as unreturned when they were actually returned. These absentee ballots were then either lost or were replaced with blank ballots filled out by election workers or other third parties.
In Pennsylvania - Lawmakers have alleged that the numbers don’t add up, and the certification of Presidential results were premature and in error.
A comparison of official county election results to the total number of voters who voted on November 3, 2020 as recorded by the Department of State shows that 6,962,607 total ballots were reported as being cast, while DoS/SURE system records indicate that only 6,760,230 total voters actually voted. Among the 6,962,607 total ballots cast, 6,931,060 total votes were counted in the presidential race, including all three candidates on the ballot and write-in candidates.
Additionally, The Pennsylvania Supreme Court usurped and contravened state legislative power by adopting a presumption that even non-postmarked ballots were timely and against state law- poll-watchers were denied access to voting stations. 
Pennsylvania’s Secretary of the Commonwealth violated Article II of the U.S. Constitution when she usurped legislative power by unilaterally abrogating Pennsylvania statutes that mandate signature verification on mail-in and absentee ballots. 
In Georgia - More than 300,000 individuals were permitted to vote who had applied for an absentee ballot more than 180 days prior to the Election Day. This is a clear violation of state law.
Additionally, video has shown poll workers counting ballots after poll watchers were asked to leave the location.  
In Georgia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania - Poll watchers and observers were denied entry to ballot counting centers by Judges of Elections and other poll workers. This was despite presenting proper certification and identification.
In Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, and Pennsylvania - Republican poll watchers were also forced inside confined areas, thereby limiting their view. In some cases, this confinement was enforced by local law enforcement. Failure to allow access casts doubt on the entire process.

Happy New Year! 
 
 
I hope you and your loved ones were able to welcome in the new year with a sense of hope and optimism for a better year. There is no question that 2020 challenged each of us in unique ways, but we are a strong and resilient community of faith and neighborly love, which allowed us to stick it out through the highs and lows of last year. As I closed out the year, I was able to spend a little time with all of my children and really take a moment to reflect on my greatest blessings in life.

Spending time with my kids in Gulfport! From left to right Ben, Aubrey and Bear
 
As we look ahead to a new Congress, which includes a larger number and a more diverse class of House Republicans, I am honored to continue representing South Mississippi in Congress. It is a privilege to defend our shared conservative values in Washington, and I will keep fighting to improve the quality of life for all South Mississippians. 
 
I will continue strengthening and protecting our military bases, supporting our veterans, growing our state's top industries, rebuilding our economy by supporting Mississippi-owned businesses, protecting the unborn, and defending our God-given freedoms.
 
I've been blessed to represent South Mississippi as a member of the powerful House Appropriations Committee's subcommittees on Homeland Security and Commerce, Justice, and Science. As we look forward in 2021, I will continue fighting and defending key priorities for our area through my role on the committee. 
 
 
ICYMI: Trump Approved Zeta Disaster Declaration
 
I was pleased to hear the President approved Mississippi's federal disaster declaration request on Thursday evening. Hurricane Zeta brought damage to our region, and many of us in South Mississippi still see the reminders of the storm every day. 
 
I believe this support from the Administration is critical and will assist in our recovery efforts. As we awaited approval of this request, I am grateful I could remain in contact with the White House and provided updates to the President's team. This decision allows us to pick up leftover debris and makes federal funding available to affected individuals in George, Greene, Hancock, Harrison, Jackson, and Stone counties.
 
Residents and business owners who sustained losses in the designated counties can begin applying for assistance by registering online at http://www.DisasterAssistance.gov or by calling 1-800-621-FEMA (3362) or 1-800-462-7585 (TTY) for the hearing and speech impaired. The toll-free telephone numbers will operate from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. (local time) seven days a week until further notice. 
 
 
Final Note
 
Regardless of the challenges presented to us in 2020, my office remains committed to serving you and your families. We've been able to help thousands of South Mississippians in a range of ways, and we would love to be of service to you. Our office numbers are listed below - please give us a call any time!

1/4/21 10:48,Supporting Virginia's Defense Community,"￼
Dear friend,
Last month, the Senate passed the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). I'm proud to say that this year's national defense bill, part of a great bipartisan effort, will provide pay raises for troops, support veteran suicide prevention initiatives, and benefit Virginia's defense community. 
This past year, I worked to ensure that our military families have the support they need, especially when it comes to accessible and affordable child care. With the constant instability that results from frequent moves, I'm glad that we can now provide this support so that military families can focus on serving our nation without worrying as much about the high costs of child care.  The final legislation also includes an amendment I supported to initiate a 3-year process to rename Department of Defense facilities currently named after Confederates, including three Virginia military bases: Fort Lee, Fort Pickett, and Fort AP Hill. We cannot continue to honor those who fought against the United States to deprive African Americans of their equality if we as a country hope to overcome the racial injustices that continue to surround us today.
Here are some of the other priorities I advocated that were included in the final defense bill:   • Funding for shipbuilding and repair. • Establishing better care and support from the Department of Veterans Affairs for veterans exposed to Agent Orange. • Providing Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) funding for research and STEM training to support national security missions. • Implementing reforms to improve military housing. • Authorizing military construction projects throughout Virginia. • Expanding the authority to carry out military installation resilience projects.  You can read more about the legislation here >>
I'm thankful we could come to a bipartisan consensus in both the Senate and House to pass these reforms that are important to strengthening Virginia's defense community and our national security.
Sincerely,
￼

PRESS RELEASE
For Immediate Release
January 4, 2021


NYS COVID Rent Relief Program Accepting Applications Through February 1, 2021

The New York State Division of Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) has reopened the COVID Rent Relief Program and will be accepting new applications through Monday, February 1, 2021


NEW YORK, NY -- The New York State Division of Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) has reopened the COVID Rent Relief Program and will be accepting new applications through Monday, February 1, 2021.  The program’s eligibility criteria have been expanded to provide rent relief to more New Yorkers.  Individuals who applied during the previous application window and were denied, do not need to apply again.  Those applications are being reviewed again.  Additionally, applications from individuals who have not received a response from the HCR are being reviewed under the new criteria. 

If approved, applicants will receive a subsidy for the difference between a household’s rent burden on March 1, 2020 and the household’s rent burden in the months of April, May, June, and July 2020.  The subsidy is a one-time payment available for a maximum of four months of rent, up to 125% of the Fair Market Rents (FMR) for that household’s area.  HCR will send payments directly to the applicant’s landlord.

To qualify, applicants must meet all of the eligibility requirements:

• You must be a renter with primary residence in New York State.

• Before March 7, 2020, and at the time of application, your household income (including unemployment benefits) must have been below 80% of the area median income, adjusted for household size.  You can find your county’s area median income, based on your household size, here. 

• Households must be “rent-burdened” during the months they are applying for assistance between April 1 to July 31, 2020.  A household is rent-burdened if they are paying more than 30 percent of their income towards housing costs. 

• You must have lost income during the period of April 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020.

Detailed information about the program, including eligibility criteria, the application process, the documents that will be requested as part of the application process, and answers to frequently answered questions are available on HCR's website.  Additionally, HCR is operating a special helpline to answer questions and provide assistance with the application process.  For help, applicants can contact HCR’s COVID Rent Relief Extension Program Call Center for assistance at 1-833-499-0318 or covidrentrelief@hcr.ny.gov.  Call Center representatives are available Monday through Friday 8:30am – 5:00pm. 

If you are chosen to receive a rental subsidy through this program, New York State will cover the difference between your household's rent burden on March 1, 2020 and your household's increase in rent burden during the period your household is applying for assistance.  Households can apply for up to four months of assistance for the months of April 2020 through July 2020.  Tenants do not have to be behind in their rent to receive assistance.  Tenants who are current on their rent payments can have funds applied towards a credit for future months.  The rent subsidy payment will go directly to your landlord. 

Deadline to submit your application is Monday, February 1, 2021. 

Apply online today or visit NYS Homes and Community Renewal for more information.

Programa de Ayuda para el Alquiler por COVID del Estado de Nueva York está aceptando solicitudes hasta el 1 de febrero de 2021

La División de Renovación de Viviendas y Comunidades del Estado de Nueva York (HCR) ha reabierto el Programa de Ayuda para el Alquiler por COVID y aceptará nuevas solicitudes hasta el lunes 1 de febrero de 2021


NEW YORK, NY -- La División de Renovación de Viviendas y Comunidades del Estado de Nueva York (HCR) ha reabierto el Programa de Ayuda para el Alquiler por COVID y aceptará nuevas solicitudes hasta el lunes 1 de febrero de 2021.  Los criterios de elegibilidad del programa se han ampliado para proporcionar alivio de alquiler a más neoyorquinos.  Las personas que presentaron una solicitud durante el período de solicitud anterior y fueron denegadas, no necesitan presentar una nueva solicitud.  Estas solicitudes están siendo revisadas nuevamente.  Las solicitudes de personas que aún no han recibido una respuesta de HCR se están revisando según los nuevos criterios.

Si es aprobada, los solicitantes recibirán un subsidio por la diferencia entre la carga del alquiler del hogar el 1 de marzo de 2020 y la carga del alquiler del hogar en los meses de abril, mayo, junio y julio de 2020.  El subsidio es un pago único disponible para un máximo de cuatro meses de alquiler, hasta el 125% de los Alquileres Justos de Mercado (FMR) que se pagan en el área de esa vivienda.  HCR enviará los pagos directamente al casero del solicitante.

Para calificar, los solicitantes deben cumplir con todos los requisitos de elegibilidad:

• Debe ser un inquilino con residencia principal en el Estado de Nueva York.

• Antes del 7 de marzo de 2020 y en el momento de la solicitud, los ingresos de su hogar (incluidos los beneficios de desempleo) deben haber estado por debajo del 80% del ingreso medio del área, ajustado al tamaño del hogar. Puede encontrar el ingreso medio del área de su condado, según el tamaño de su hogar, aquí.

• Los hogares deben estar “sobrecargados por el alquiler” durante los meses en que solicitan asistencia entre el 1 de abril y el 31 de julio de 2020.  Un hogar está sobrecargado por el alquiler si paga más del 30 por ciento de sus ingresos para los costos de vivienda.

• Usted debe haber perdido ingresos durante el período del 1 de abril de 2020 al 31 de julio de 2020.

La información detallada sobre el programa, incluidos los criterios de elegibilidad, el proceso de solicitud, los documentos que se solicitarán como parte del proceso de solicitud y las respuestas a las preguntas frecuentes están disponibles en el sitio web de HCR. Además, HCR tiene en funcionamiento una línea de ayuda especial para responder preguntas y brindar asistencia con el proceso de solicitud. Para obtener ayuda, los solicitantes pueden comunicarse con el Centro de Llamadas del Programa Extendido de Ayuda para el Alquiler por COVID de HCR al 1-833-499-0318 o covidrentrelief@hcr.ny.gov.  Los representantes del Centro de Llamadas están disponibles de lunes a viernes de 8:30 am a 5:00 pm.

Si es elegido para recibir un subsidio de alquiler a través de este programa, el Estado de Nueva York cubrirá la diferencia entre la carga del alquiler de su hogar el 1 de marzo de 2020 y el aumento de la carga del alquiler de su hogar durante el período en que su hogar está solicitando asistencia. Los hogares pueden solicitar hasta cuatro meses de asistencia para los meses de abril de 2020 a julio de 2020. Los inquilinos no tienen que estar atrasados en el pago del alquiler para recibir asistencia. A los inquilinos que están al día en sus pagos de alquiler se les pueden aplicar fondos para un crédito para meses futuros. El pago del subsidio de alquiler irá directamente a su casero.

La fecha límite para enviar su solicitud es el lunes, 1 de febrero de 2021.

Solicite en línea hoy o visite NYS Homes and Community Renewal para más información.

1/4/21 10:14,Wicker Backs COVID-19 Relief Package,"￼
Wicker Backs COVID-19 Relief Package   Congress Approves New Aid and Several Wicker-Led Bills 
This past week, President Trump signed a new COVID-19 relief bill paired with legislation to fund the government through the end of fiscal year 2021. The measure passed Congress with huge majorities after congressional leaders worked closely with President Trump’s senior leadership team to craft the final agreement. Days later, President Trump signed the bill into law. Although it does not contain every priority the President or I wanted, this measure will provide a much-needed boost to families, workers, and businesses weathering the effects of this pandemic. 
Direct Relief for Americans 
Earlier this year, Congress passed the largest relief package in U.S. history to meet the urgent needs arising from the coronavirus pandemic. Although many have regained employment, millions still remain out of work, and eight million Americans have fallen into poverty. The food, entertainment, and travel industries are particularly hard-hit by ongoing health restrictions. It is clear that Americans need a fresh round of assistance. 
The new aid package provides direct payments of $600 for every adult making up to $75,000, plus $600 for each child. It expands weekly unemployment benefits by $300 for 10 weeks, a short-term lift that will help unemployed Americans until they can find work again. It also adds $285 billion to reopen the Paycheck Protection Program, allowing more small businesses to receive forgivable loans to keep employees on the payroll. The bill encourages employers to provide paid sick leave by offering a tax credit. And it provides new support for agriculture and the transportation sector, which are suffering severe losses. 
This legislation will also boost our nation’s effort to defeat the coronavirus. The bill directs billions to support the distribution of vaccines, which are already reaching at-risk individuals and frontline workers. It designates $22 billion for COVID-19 testing and tracing efforts. And it sends more than $90 billion to schools, universities, and daycares to help cover expenses necessary for safe reopening. I helped secure additional funding to support telehealth, enabling more people to receive care from home during the pandemic. 
Landmark Bills Will Benefit Mississippi 
The government funding package included additional measures that will benefit Mississippi. I helped guarantee support for new broadband data maps, which will lead to more broadband development in unserved areas. Congress also approved millions to help deploy broadband in rural communities, which I have long supported. In addition, I worked to secure funding to help American companies remove and replace Chinese equipment from their telecommunications networks, which could be used to spy on Americans. 
Lawmakers passed another major priority in the Water Resources Development Act. This bill could lead to more investment in Mississippi seaports, like the Port of Gulfport and the Port of Pascagoula, and harbors in Biloxi, Port Bienville, and Bay St. Louis. It will boost funding availability for environmental projects in DeSoto and Jackson Counties, and create feasibility studies for projects in Jackson, Hancock, and Jones Counties. I wrote a provision requiring a study on the impacts of flooding that overwhelmed the Bonnet Carré Spillway in 2019. I hope this study will lead to new projects that will reduce flooding along the Lower Mississippi River. 
Congress also approved several bills I have been working to pass since 2019. One of those is the PIPES Act, which will improve the safety of pipelines that deliver energy to our communities. Congress also passed my legislation overhauling the certification process for commercial aircraft after my committee’s investigation revealed troubling oversight failures. This legislation will correct those regulatory lapses and improve the safety of our aviation system. Taken as a whole, this year-end legislation will advance America’s economic and security interests as we enter 2021.

1/3/21 22:58,Weekly Wrap Up,"
￼ 
Dear Neighbor,  Happy New Year!  2021 brings new promise and opportunity.  It also brings us a new Congress.  I was honored and proud to be sworn in to represent our district today in the 117th United States Congress.  In this new year, and in this new Congress, my priority remains the same: bringing the voice of our community to Congress and working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to address the challenges before us.  I will continue to work every day to improve the lives of the people in our district and across our country in partnership with our community. 
￼
While I look forward to all we will do in the 117th Congress, I am also glad to look back on the work our team has been able to accomplish over the past year.  In the face of new challenges, we worked tirelessly to protect the health, security, and well-being of our district.  We also continued our work on matters of importance to our community—from our health care to our economy to our infrastructure.  I am glad share an overview of our work in my 2020 Annual Report, which you can view and download here. 
￼

￼

￼
COVID-19 continues to spread in our community and our state at concerning rates.  The positive test rate statewide is at approximately 20 percent, and the positivity rate in our community at 14.1 percent.  Hospitalizations for the virus continue to increase and place added strain to our health care providers.  While this latest surge has been centered in the El Paso, Lubbock, Amarillo and the Big Bend region, Harris County has had the highest total number of confirmed cases at 21,945 over the past 14 days.  It is critical that we continue to do our part to stop the spread of the virus to help protect everyone’s health even as vaccines provide new hope in the battle against COVID-19.   Across Texas, 773,000 doses of the vaccine have been distributed.  In Harris County, 15,475 people have received the vaccine.  At this time, Harris County is only providing a vaccine for health care workers, people over 65, or those with underlying health conditions.  On Tuesday, the Texas Department of State Health released a map showing locations of COVID-19 vaccine providers, but with limited availability of the vaccine, an appointment will still be needed for those who eligible. 
￼
As we wait for vaccines to be distributed, getting a COVID-19 test continues to be one of the best tools we have to stop the spread of the virus.  More than 25 percent people who have tested positive for COVID-19 are asymptomatic.  If you need a test, visit: http://covidcheck.hctx.net or call 832-927-7575 to schedule an appointment with Harris County Public Health.
￼
I am glad to provide weekly updates on my work in our community and my work in Washington—and I look forward to continuing to do so this year.  Please remember that I am here to represent you and to help you in any way I can.  You can contact me and my team at any time by emailing here or by calling (713) 353-8680.  I look forward to hearing from you!
Best wishes,

￼
 
Dear Friend,

Today we kicked off the 117th Congress, and I was sworn in as your Member of Congress in the U.S. House of Representatives. Four years ago, I had the privilege of becoming the first Vietnamese-American woman to serve in Congress and the first woman ever to represent Florida’s Seventh Congressional District. It’s an honor to have been given the opportunity to serve Central Florida for the next two years, and you have my word I’ll continue to do everything I can to earn the trust that you have placed in me.

Since taking office in 2017, my priority has been to listen to my constituents, to deliver results for my community, and to put people above politics. Excessive partisanship and polarization in Congress have hurt the American people, especially during this pandemic, which is why in this new Congress I’ll keep working across party lines to help more Floridians.

As we emerge from this health and economic crisis, my office is here to help you. If you have questions about the status of your economic impact payment, need assistance with a federal agency, or want to share your views with me on an important issue, please do not hesitate to reach out here.

My job as your representative is to listen and be your voice in our nation’s capital.

So let’s get to work.

Sincerely, 
￼
Stephanie Murphy
Member of Congress

 It's Time to Stand Up and Be Counted
 Last night, I had a call with President Trump, Leader McCarthy, and TONS of Jan. 6 election objectors. Talked strategy – VERY encouraged!

To House and Senate GOP members: it’s time to stand up and be counted. This is a pivotal moment.

If we don't stand for election integrity now – we may never see an honest election again.

Democrats Don't Want to Debate Election Integrity

Remembering Congressman-elect Luke Letlow
Luke Letlow was a devoted husband, father, and public servant who dedicated his life to serving the people he loved: the citizens of the Great State of Louisiana.

From his small home town of Start, to Louisiana Tech in Ruston, the State Capitol in Baton Rouge, to Capitol Hill in Washington – no one was better prepared to represent the 5th District of Louisiana in Congress, and his loss will be felt by all of us in Congress and every American.

Roxanne and I send our most sincere prayers to Luke’s family, Congressman Ralph Abraham, and the countless friends and family who had the joy of knowing Luke along the way. He will be greatly missed.

Dear Neighbor, 
 
It has been the honor of my life to serve you in the U.S. Congress these past two years. Colorado’s 2nd District is truly an incredible place and one I am privileged to call home and to represent in the House of Representatives. 
 
This year has been an especially challenging one for our community, but here in Colorado, when faced with great challenges, we do things differently. Together, we roll up our sleeves, work together, listen to each other, innovate, and lead with compassion and resolve. That’s the Colorado way.  
 
As I’ve traveled our wonderful district for 46 town halls, both in person and virtually, I’ve learned how incredibly resilient our community is as we’ve dealt with COVID-19, historic wildfires and so much more.   
I wanted to give you a brief look at some of what we’ve accomplished in the last two years in the 116th Congress. 
 
DELIVERING FOR COLORADO 
 
I’m incredibly proud of all that we have accomplished in my first term. Our office introduced over 55 pieces of legislation, we passed 19 bills through Congress and sent 9 to the President's desk to be signed into law, including our legislation to support our mountain communities through funds for rural schools, road maintenance and emergency response; legislation to protect wildlife in the Platte River Basin and ensure constituents in
￼
the town of Minturn can access the local water supply at the Bolts Ditch Headgate. Our bill to authorize the first-ever outdoor monument honoring the women’s suffrage movement was also signed into law.
 
LEADING ON CLIMATE ACTION 
  
￼
This term we passed major Colorado wilderness legislation through the House of Representatives; the first time this has been done in over a decade. The CORE Act was crafted by Coloradans and would preserve 400,000 acres of public lands across our state, protect our treasured outdoor places and invest in our outdoor recreation economy. Fighting against climate change and 
protecting our public lands is crucial to making sure we leave a better world for future generations. I will continue to fight for these causes in the 117th congress.
 
FIGHTING FOR OUR COMMUNITIES AMIDST A CHALLENGING YEAR
  
In 2020, our communities faced tremendous challenges, a once-in-a-century health and economic crisis, and brutal and devastating wildfires. We partnered with local and state officials, public health experts, firefighters and emergency response officials to problem-solve and help where we could. We worked with the CDC to ensure our local firefighters were given priority COVID-19 testing and we worked with FEMA to bring in recovery funds for the Cameron Peak, Calwood and East Troublesome Fires. 
 
￼
We introduced 13 bills to equip and support our communities amidst COVID-19, and several of our proposals were incorporated into the economic relief package, which was signed into law, including our proposal to increase SNAP benefits by 15%, make improvements to the strategic national stockpile, support our small businesses and provide relief for our child care facilities. 
OUR OFFICE REMAINS READY TO ASSIST YOU
  
￼
My office has been incredibly busy serving our constituents over the past two years.
Our team of constituent advocates have worked with constituents to solve their unemployment claims, access small business loans and receive Economic Impact Payments from the IRS. At the start of the COVID-19 outbreak, we coordinated with federal agencies to bring countless Coloradans stranded abroad home. We successfully 
solved cases for over 1,300 constituents and returned nearly $2 million to our constituents. If you need assistance accessing COVID-19 relief benefits, need help with Colorado wildfires, or other federal issues such as accessing social security benefits, filing your tax returns, etc, please contact our office. 
 
READ OUR 2020 END OF YEAR REPORT
  
￼
 
Over the 116th congress, my office has worked hard for the people of Colorado. We will continue to work for you and your loved ones in the 117th congress, and I cannot wait to hear from you, and hopefully have the chance to meet you soon. 
 
I am wishing all of you a happy, healthy, and prosperous new year.

We Will Object

Co-authored By: Rep. Jason Smith (MO-08), Rep. Vicky Hartzler (MO-04), Rep. Sam Graves (MO-06), & Rep. Billy Long (MO-07)

Next week, your 117th United States Congress will convene for the first time. After the election of Speaker and the adoption of the Rules of Congress, the action will quickly move to reading aloud the electoral votes submitted by each state from this past November's election - counting them, and declaring the vote tally for President and Vice President. During that process, the question will be put before your elected officials - does anyone object to the certification of electoral votes of a state. We will object. Our hope is that others will join us.

We don't take this decision lightly, but we must protect the integrity of each vote cast by every law-abiding Missourian. For every instance of Georgia failing to follow its own state law in verifying signatures, of Pennsylvania accepting mail ballots after the legal deadline set by its state legislature, or folks from outside Nevada casting a ballot in that state - the value of every Missourians’ vote is diminished. That's not right. And we cannot simply look the other way.

The right to freely cast your vote in elections is a sacred privilege afforded to us as Americans because of the sacrifices of the patriots who fought for that right. When that process is spoiled and abused by officials not following their own state law, it violates that right and jeopardizes the entire integrity and foundation of 'free and fair' elections. In such instances, where voting process changes are made without the consent of the voter, we know it is our duty and our obligation to serve as a backstop to protect the power of one person, one vote - to protect your vote as a Missourian. We must be able to have confidence in not only the agreement and expectation that this election would follow the law, but future ones will as well. We take the responsibility of upholding the Constitution seriously, and that is why we feel compelled to object to the electoral count taking place on January 6th. 

The reported results of this past November's Presidential election don't even pass the most basic eye test. Republicans were projected to lose seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, we gained more than a dozen. Republicans were supposed to lose control of several state legislatures, we picked up multiple. We were projected to lose control of the United States Senate - we didn't, and we won't. All of this occurred on the same night President Trump lost? It's hard to believe. Combined with the daily reports of voting irregularities where state election laws were discarded and not followed, something doesn't add up. President Trump won over 74 million votes, Obama - 69 million. President Trump won 2586 counties, Obama - 873 counties, Joe Biden - 527 counties. The numbers, the evidence, and the abnormalities all speak for themselves. 

We have joined lawsuits, called for a Special Counsel and demanded accountability and integrity, now we finally get to cast our vote. We have no illusions about the outcome, at the end of the day, this is still Nancy Pelosi's House. Our only hope is that more will join us - that more will value protecting the vote of every American living in their state as much as we do fighting for yours.

A Win for Small Businesses
 
 
The recent Covid Relief package included $284 billion in a second round of Paycheck Protection Program loans and simplified the forgiveness process for loans under $150,000. Chambers of Commerce, 501(c)6s, and newspapers are eligible. Aid will be targeted towards businesses who haven’t yet received any PPP funding. 
As of August 8, 2020—when the first round of PPP loans closed—the SBA had approved 5,212,128 PPP loans. More than 5,000 lenders participated in administering the program, and the average loan was approximately $100,729. In total, the loans amounted to more than $525 billion.
For more information, click here.
Additionally, the SBA extended COVID 19 EIDL deadline. The U.S. Small Business Administration extended the deadline to apply for the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program for the COVID-19 Pandemic disaster declaration to Dec. 31, 2021. The deadline extension comes as a result of the recent bipartisan COVID-19 relief bill passed by Congress and enacted by President Trump on Dec. 27, 2020.
To date, the SBA has approved $197 billion in low-interest loans which provides working capital funds to small businesses, non-profits and agricultural businesses make it through this challenging time.
Every eligible small business and nonprofit are encouraged to apply to get the resources they need.

January 3, 2021
 

Dear Friend, 

After what has been a very challenging year for many of us, I truly believe betters days lie ahead. I would like to wish you and your family a healthy, happy and prosperous New Year! 

I am in Washington, D.C. this morning and will be taking the oath of office later today as we begin the 117th Congress. Serving as your collective voice is one of the greatest honors of my life. You can be assured that I will continue to do my best to help us achieve three important goals: Restoring our Way of Life, Rebuilding our Economy and Renewing the American Dream. I know these are difficult times and many people within our community feel passionately about how our nation can best achieve these goals. Representing a constituency with diverse points of view is not an easy task. However, I will continue to look for areas of agreement and work to build consensus on the best path forward.  You can count on me to put partisan politics aside, reach across the aisle and get results on the issues that are most important to our community.  We will defeat the challenges facing our nation, both at home and abroad. And, we will work together to build a strong future of security, prosperity and opportunity for all Americans.  

Continue reading for a brief recap of my efforts on your behalf last week. 

Keeping Americans Safe

As of yesterday, more than 4.2 million Americans have received the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Health officials anticipate that 50 million Americans will be vaccinated by the end of January, with another 50 million more by the end of February. The goal is to ensure that every American who wants a vaccine is able to get one by the end of May. 
 
 

As you may be aware, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) issued recommendations for which groups should be prioritized for getting the vaccine first. Based on those recommendations, each state developed a plan for how it would distribute the vaccine. In Florida, Governor DeSantis has prioritized seniors living in long-term care facilities and front line healthcare workers with direct patient contact. The state is in the process of vaccinating these two key groups. 

Local health departments throughout the state of Florida have also now received a limited supply of COVID-19 vaccinations to begin vaccinating residents aged 65 and older. Pasco County’s Health Department began vaccinating seniors last Thursday, with the help of the Florida National Guard. 
 

The Pasco County Health Department is vaccinating approximately 500 seniors per day. All seniors must be registered in order to receive a vaccine. Each morning, the Department is releasing more registration slots for the following day’s vaccination. While the Department is working to expand distribution, as of right now, the only way to register is through the Health Department’s website.  

Pinellas and Hillsborough Counties will be rolling out their vaccination procedures for seniors this week. When more information about how to register in those counties becomes available, I will share it on my social media page. Additionally, all Floridians can receive updates via text about the availability of the COVID-19 vaccine in our state by texting FLCOVID19 to 888777. This program is run by the Florida Division of Emergency Management Services. 
 
 

I will continue to work with all three counties in my district to ensure they have the support needed to distribute the vaccine to targeted populations as easily as possible. In fact, last week, I met with the owners of PolarStorm, a local small business, about its mobile, all-electric delivery platform designed for safe vaccine delivery whenever temperature control is critical. We discussed the company’s potential ability to help efficiently and safely distribute the COVID-19 vaccine to rural and remote areas.  
 
 

Providing Relief to Americans and Small Businesses Who Are Struggling

As I discussed in last week’s newsletter, the pandemic relief package recently signed into law was not a perfect piece of legislation. For example, I would have much preferred $2,000 stimulus payments to the American public instead of the $600.00 payment which is now law. The House did pass a second bill last week which would raise the amount of the payment to $2,000; however as of today the Senate has not passed this second bill. Therefore, millions of Americans began receiving the $600.00 stimulus payment last week. The IRS has said it is working as quickly as possible to distribute the second round of stimulus payments, and it hopes to have the vast majority of payments distributed by mid January. 

The legislation also included enhanced unemployment benefits for Americans who have lost their job during the pandemic and remain unemployed. The temporary $300.00 per week federal unemployment benefit will be for weeks of unemployment that occur from December 26 through March 13, 2021. I have received many calls from constituents asking questions about how the program will be administered in Florida. I’ve reached out to the Governor’s office and was told that his team is working on implementation guidance as quickly as possible and expects to share details this week.

Another key provision in the relief package is a second round of Paycheck Protection Program loans for small businesses who have experienced a loss of revenue throughout the pandemic. Click here to learn more about the qualifications for a second loan. Businesses will once again apply directly through their lenders.   

Getting Things Done

I am proud of what my team and I have been able to accomplish for the constituents of District 12. Despite a global pandemic, my team and I worked tirelessly to assist those in need. 
 

Advocating for our Nation’s Heroes
 
Having served as a Conferee who helped negotiate an agreement on the National Defense Authorization Act, I am pleased that my colleagues in the House and Senate were able to put aside partisan differences and achieve consensus about how to best prioritize the security of our nation while addressing the needs of our military, their families and our Veterans. It is importation that these critical provisions have now become law.  
 
 

Fighting the Opioid Epidemic 

This year’s budget includes $4 billion to help address substance abuse problems. We’ve seen staggering increases in overdose deaths throughout the country and here at home during the pandemic. The Pasco County Sheriff’s office just released overdose statistics for the month of November. There were 87 total overdoses in Pasco during the month, 16 of which were fatal. My hope is that the funding we just allocated will help to improve access to treatment so that those who are willing can get the help they need.   

 
 

Recognizing Success

Last week, I was honored to present the Congressional Award to my constituent, June Lee. The Congressional Award is the highest honor bestowed upon civilian youth. Youth around the country enroll in the program, set goals in the area of Voluntary Public Service, Personal Development, Physical Fitness and Expedition/Exploration. Then, the students put in hundreds of hours over a long-term period to achieve those goals in pursuit of the award. As part of her project, June volunteered countless hours working with special needs students at a local equestrian center and played the piano for senior citizens in our community. Congratulations, June. I am proud of your success!
 
 

Serving You Better

I am in the process of moving my New Port Richey office to the West Pasco Government Complex. The new facility will be more accessible to the public. During this transition, my entire team will be working out of my Tarpon Springs Office. The main phone number will remain the same, 727-232-2921. If you need to mail anything to my district office, please use this address: P.O. Box 247 Elfers, FL 34680. Once my new office is fully operational, I will share more detailed information about its exact location.  
 
 

Constituent Corner

I recently received this note from a constituent who lives in New Port Richey. 

I recently moved to your district from Pensacola. I'm 85 years old and this has been a big change for me. I didn't know how to update my address with government offices. I needed the VA for my pension, Medicare and Social Security. I called your office for help and the gal I spoke to was able to walk me through the steps for all three agencies. I was surprised to receive a call a few weeks later from your office to make sure the address changes went through. Never in my life have I had such good customer service when calling my state or federal politicians. Thank you so much for the help. 

This is just one example of the work we do each day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!

Sincerely,

Rep. Carter reflects on 2020

In optometry, 20/20 represents perfect vision. However, no one could have envisioned what would happen in the year 2020.

At the beginning of the year, we had a surging stock market and record low levels of unemployment, including among African Americans and Hispanics.

In January, we were just starting to hear about the coronavirus, but our knowledge was limited due to the coverup from the Chinese government, their media restrictions, and country-wide lockdown.

As the pandemic quickly progressed in the United States and across the globe, many of Congress’ priorities shifted along with the needs of the American people.

Despite an unusual congressional calendar and unprecedented changes to the way we conduct business in the House of Representatives, I remained focused on securing critical wins for the people of the First Congressional District of Georgia.

At the beginning of the pandemic, Congress approved critical aid for small businesses and hardworking Americans. I was proud to support the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) which protected thousands of jobs and small businesses across Georgia. In the First District alone, PPP loans were distributed to more than 10,000 small businesses supporting more than 100,000 jobs.

We also learned quickly during the pandemic that our medical supply chain is too dependent on foreign nations for life-saving medications and protective equipment. Nearly 70% of medications or medication ingredients are produced overseas, primarily in China and India. As countries moved to tighten control over their supplies, it was a wake-up call that we needed to do something.

To address this, I introduced the MADE in America Act to attract pharmaceutical manufacturing back to the United States while placing an emphasis on opportunity zones, which are underserved areas in need of investment and job opportunities. In addition to this effort, I introduced the State Stockpile Readiness Act to help states establish their own strategic stockpiles in the event of future pandemics. I was also successful in getting the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to approve new hand sanitizer options during shortages.

In 2020 we continued to address the unfair trade relationships facing our nation. I helped to spearhead efforts to bring parity to the fruit and vegetable industry of the Southeast United States from unfair trade practices perpetuated by several countries, including Mexico. As a result of these efforts, the U.S. Trade Representative took the unprecedented step of initiating a Section 201 safeguards investigation to determine the true impact on our domestic blueberry industry. That investigation is laying the groundwork to hold foreign growers accountable for dumping product in American markets and flattening the ability of domestic producers to compete.

This year we were also able to secure full funding for the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project to keep it on track. I also fought to ensure the Columbia-class submarines that will be the next generation of nuclear submarines at Kings Bay remain on track. We also secured the expansion of Fort Frederica, allowing the park to encompass more historic sites for generations to come.

I also had seven bills passed addressing important issues like scams during the pandemic, medical transportation for patients, drug pricing data, state medical supply stockpiles, and an expansion of telehealth training at VA facilities to benefit the treatment of veterans. All of this was done with bipartisan support in an era of increased partisanship. Simply put, I have been successful in working across party lines to get things done.

Finally, most importantly, as a member of the Doctor’s Caucus in the House, I worked with Operation Warp Speed and federal partners to promote the timely creation of a COVID-19 vaccine. Now that a vaccine has been approved, the private-public partnership under Operation Warp Speed will work to distribute 100 million initial vaccine doses and up to 500 million additional doses. This vaccine is safe, effective and will help return us to our normal way of life. To prove my confidence in this vaccine, I am participating in a Pfizer clinical trial myself.

As we look ahead to 2021, I want to say thank you for the honor and privilege of representing you and our home in Congress. Serving the people of the First Congressional District of Georgia has been one of the greatest honors of my life and I will continue fighting for you every day.

Introducing the Republican Freshmen
January 3, 2021 | View Online
￼ 
They weren’t supposed to win. Their candidacies and campaigns were cast aside. Written off by the polling and media class. Of course, the experts got it wrong -- again. They got it wrong because what often consumes the minds of the beltway isn’t what working Americans are facing in their everyday lives. The new Republican members of Congress are a strong representation of who America is and where we come from. 

Each member has a uniquely impressive background rich with experience and hard work -- they’ve achieved success and have overcome hardships that have earned them a deep understanding of where Americans want our country to go. 
 
The Republican freshmen are entrepreneurs, fishermen, hunters, dairy farmers, and immigrants. 

The Republican freshmen are restaurant owners, grandparents, veterans, pharmacists, and they’ve fled socialist countries. 

The Republican freshmen are West Point graduates, professional football players, motivational speakers, firefighters, and black belts. 

The Republican freshmen are lawyers, single mothers, F-22 Raptor fighter pilots, physicians, and coaches. 

The Republican freshmen are Naval cryptologists, sheriffs, cattle farmers, deacons, and newlyweds. 

And today, they bring everything they learned in each of these roles to Congress as Republicans in the United States House of Representatives. 

Together, we will always fight for America.

1/2/21 12:04,"2020, A Year in Review","￼

 
Looking Back on 2020
 
2020 was a year unlike any other in my lifetime. We began the year with a booming economy, where we saw more Americans working than ever before, wages rising and unemployment at record lows. In January news stories began to appear about a new coronavirus afflicting the people of Wuhan, China. By March, COVID-19, had spread to the United States and throughout the world. We mourn everyone that we have lost to COVID-19.
 
As we march into 2021, we are in a much better position to deal with this virus, and hopefully we will soon claim victory against this disease and return to normalcy.
 
Here is a look back at some of our accomplishments from 2020.
  
 
January
 
Each January, tens of thousands of people gather in Washington, D.C. for the March for Life to celebrate life and bring awareness to the growing pro-life movement. This year's March for Life was historic, as President Trump became the first sitting U.S. President to speak at the event, where he reaffirmed our shared belief that each newborn child is a sacred gift from God. I took to the floor of the House to speak in support of the sanctity of human life and rights of the unborn. We have a moral and civic duty to protect those who are voiceless and defenseless, namely our unborn children.
  
 
￼
 
  
On January 10, the Trump Administration marked the 100th mile of border wall had been completed.
 
I also held my first three town hall meetings of 2020 in Algoma, Burnett and Oakfield.
  
￼
  
On January 29, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) was signed into law. This new trade agreement modernized and improved the 1992 North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). The USMCA is a boon to manufacturing, agriculture, small business and consumers. In Wisconsin, 231,000 jobs and nearly $11 billion rely on trade with Mexico and Canada, so the USMCA is particularly beneficial for Wisconsin workers and will continue to be for years to come.
  
 
February
 
With my support, the House voted to reauthorize the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. This vital program will enhance water quality, promote habitat restoration and protect the Great Lakes from invasive species. I was pleased to speak about this great bipartisan bill on the House Floor.
  
 
￼
 
  
In February, I took my fourth trip to our Southern border. It is of paramount importance that we fix our broken immigration system by securing our border and indicating clear points of entry. This will not only improve the way our country keeps track of who comes in, but it will protect the men, women and children who would have otherwise been abused by the drug cartels on their journey to illegally cross our Southern border by providing them a safe way to enter the United States.
  
￼
  
I also held my second round of 2020 town hall meetings in Fredonia, Adell.
  
￼
  
It was an honor to receive the centennial challenge coin to commemorate the Disabled Veterans of America's 100th anniversary.
  
￼
  
I welcomed Department of Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia to Wisconsin on February 25. We discussed the resurgence of manufacturing in the Midwest and how we can continue to grow the industry as well as prepare the next generation for these good, high-paying skilled jobs.
  
￼
  
 
March
 
Dr. Morna Foy, President of the Wisconsin Technical College System, joined me at a hearing with the House Education and Labor Committee on March 4. Dr. Foy and I agree that Wisconsin is a leader in apprenticeship programs and that we need to expand them not only in our state, but nationwide. You can watch my conversation with Dr. Foy by clicking the video below.
  
 
￼
 
  
One of the last events I attended before the COVID-19 lockdown was a Special Olympics basketball tournament in Sheboygan. It was great to see these athletes shine!
  
￼
  
As COVID-19 began to spread throughout the U.S., I began to search for answers and make sure Wisconsin was taken care of as the crisis escalated by sending three bipartisan letters. The first went to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Stephen Hahn urging him to send more supplies for COVID-19 test kits to Wisconsin and take active steps to ensure Wisconsin health care providers have all the necessary testing equipment. The second went to Jovita Carranza, Administrator of the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), to express our support for Governor Evers' request for Economic Injury Disaster Loans for all Wisconsin counties affected by COVID-19. The third was sent to the Federal Emergency Management Association (FEMA) to request more testing supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE) for Wisconsin's first responders and health care workers. 
 
By the end of this month, COVID-19 had become a household name and on March 27, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which was signed into law by President Trump the same day. This legislation included expanded testing capabilities nationwide, increased funding for PPE and authorized the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). PPP allowed businesses affected by government-imposed lockdowns to retain and continue to pay their employees by providing interest-free loans to be used for certain expenses like payroll.
  
 
April
 
As April began, President Trump approved Wisconsin's disaster declaration retroactive to January 20. Doing so gave Wisconsin additional flexibility to access funds through FEMA to pay for expenses related to COVID-19. 
 
On April 2, we lost a true American hero, Lt. Col. James ""Maggie"" Megellas, less than a month after his 103rd birthday. Maggie, a Fond du Lac native, served in World War II, where he single-handedly disarmed an enemy tank, risking his own life to save others. For this, I believe he deserves the Medal of Honor. You can read more about Maggie by clicking here.
 
On April 3, most of Wisconsin's Congressional delegation, including myself, sent a bipartisan letter to United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Secretary Sonny Perdue asking him to use the funds we appropriated to USDA through the CARES Act to help our Wisconsin dairy farmers and processors.
 
Also in April, my COVID-19 resource website went live. You can access it by clicking here. I hope you find the information useful. However, if there is something I missed or something you think I should include on the web page, please feel free to let me or my staff know!
  
 
May
 
May 14, 2020 marked the second anniversary of the United States embassy in Israel moving to Jerusalem. This move was supposed to take place after the Jerusalem Embassy Act became law in 1995, but President Clinton never acted, nor did President Bush or President Obama. Luckily, President Trump realized that this move was long overdue and put the U.S. embassy in Jerusalem where it belongs.
 
This month, the FDA released guidelines for restaurants to safely reopen during COVID-19. The lockdown hurt small businesses in Wisconsin and many closed their doors for good because of it. I believe these guidelines will help keep people safe and are a vastly better course of action than more blanket shutdowns.
 
I planned on holding more town hall meetings this month in Manitowoc County. Due to COVID-19, however, these in-person town halls were changed to telephone town hall meetings. Thanks to everyone in Manitowoc County who participated in my telephone town hall, where we discussed what Congress had done to ensure states have the PPE and testing capabilities they need as well as ways Congress had been working to safely reopen our economy and get Wisconsinites back to work.
  
￼
  
Medical research studies out of Northwestern University and Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland were released asserting that vitamin D deficiency may play a role in increasing the severity of symptoms and overall mortality rate in COVID-19 patients. While vitamin D is not a cure for COVID-19, the research illustrates a clear correlation between vitamin D deficiencies and COVID-19 mortality rates. I sent this information to Wisconsin news outlets through a press release and began to call on the CDC to further investigate the relationship between vitamin D and COVID-19.
  
 
June
 
In June, I announced that I would begin serving as Ranking Member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee's Subcommittee on National Security, which plays an important role in making sure the interests of the United States are being represented equitably and ethically.
 
On June 16, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Andrew Wheeler visited Sheboygan to announce that Inland Sheboygan and Door County are now meeting higher air quality standards.
  
￼
  
Each year, Congress holds the Artistic Discovery competition, which is open to all high school students in the country. The winner from each Congressional District will have his or her artwork displayed in the U.S. Capitol for one year in an exhibit that features winners from other congressional districts across the U.S. This year's winner was Michelle McMahon of Lodi High School for her piece titled ""Beneath the Surface"".
  
￼
  
 
July
 
On July 1, 2020, the USMCA went into effect, helping the 231,000 jobs in Wisconsin that depend on trade with Mexico and Canada.
 
The next day, I joined dozens of my colleagues in sending a bipartisan, bicameral letter to Secretary of state Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Stephen Mnuchin after receiving disturbing new evidence of human rights violations taking place in China. We learned that the Chinese government is intentionally working to destroy and essentially wipe out Uighur families, culture and religious adherence and is encouraging violence against women. We demand justice for the Uighur people and that the United States should lead the world in condemning this behavior publicly and place sanctions on China if they do not cease these sickening practices.
 
Earlier this year, I voted to authorize the Paycheck Protection Program. In July, the Green Bay Press Gazette reported that more than 85,000 Wisconsin businesses had been help through this program, meaning that hundreds of thousands of employees benefitted as well!
 
On July 16, I joined every member of Wisconsin’s Congressional delegation in sending a bipartisan letter to Navy Secretary Kenneth Braithwaite asking for one of the new Virginia-class submarines currently under construction to be called the U.S.S. Wisconsin.
 
We also learned that the FDA-approved drug Fenofibrate, brand name Tricor, may lessen the ill-effects of COVID-19. After this news, I began calling on the CDC to investigate this lead because it could begin saving lives immediately.
 
In July, we began to see some people, including prominent politicians, call for cities to cut funding to their police departments. I made it clear then and will reaffirm my position now: I will oppose any measure that will take resources away from our police departments. These men and women in uniform are heroes who put their lives on the line every day to protect us and deserve our respect, gratitude and support.
  
 
August
 
Earlier this year, I held telephone town hall meetings because it is important to be available to you, especially during a pandemic. In August, I was able to once again hold in-person town hall meetings in Newton, Mt. Calvary and Sheboygan Falls. These meetings followed guidelines put forth by the CDC including mask-wearing policies, social distancing rules and sanitizing procedures.
  
￼
  
On August 18, I announced that I had ""adopted"" Pastor A Dao, a Vietnamese Prisoner of Conscience, through the Defending Freedoms Project of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission. Pastor A Dao is a Protestant pastor of the Montagnard Evangelical Church of Christ (MECC) and an advocate for religious freedom who, since 2016, had been held prisoner in communist Vietnam for his religious beliefs. Many Americans do not know the horrors of communism and the human rights abuses that happen daily in communist countries like Vietnam. Pastor Dao’s story is a reminder of the importance of protecting religious freedom in the United States and that nobody should be persecuted, hurt or killed because of their religious beliefs. Read more here.
  
￼
  
Pastor A Dao
  
In 2014, Mishicot native Dillon Mueller was stung by a bee and suffered a severe allergic reaction called anaphylaxis, which tragically lead to his passing. Dillon was 18 years old. Since then, his parents, Angel and George Mueller, have been working to educate people about anaphylaxis and train individuals to administer Epinephrine, which can stop allergic reactions like this and could have saved Dillon's life. This year, Angel and George contacted my office and brought a bill to my attention, that I quickly introduced, called the Epi for Dilly Act. A version of this bill has already been signed into law in Wisconsin, Minnesota and Indiana with overwhelming bipartisan support. My version of the bill will essentially make what has been adopted by these states federal law, and make Epinephrine training more widely available, enabling more individuals to prevent tragedies involving anaphylaxis from occurring. Click here to read more about Dillon Mueller and the Epi for Dilly Act.
  
￼

On August 31, I visited Gundersen Health System at their critical access hospital in Friendship and their clinic in Westfield. Thank you to these providers, and all health care professionals and front line workers who have been working overtime to accommodate COVID-19 patients and keep themselves and other patients safe and healthy.
  
￼
  
 
September
 
In September, I took to the House floor to speak about a bill I had recently introduced, the Biosimilar Insulin Access Act. This legislation will help increase competition in the insulin market, expand availability of affordable insulin products and lower costs to patients who depend on insulin. Read more here.
  
 
￼
 
  
After months of promoting the importance of vitamin D in maintaining a healthy immune system, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, finally joined me in endorsing this important vitamin. After this news, I gave my colleagues an update on the importance of vitamin D from the House floor.
  
 
￼
 
  
On September 18, one month after I ""adopted"" Pastor A Dao, we received news that his sentence was commuted and he had been released from prison a few days before, more than a year earlier than expected. Thank you to the United States Council on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) and the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission for all the work they put in to help Pastor Dao receive justice and stop violations of religious liberty around the world. The best way to stop religious persecution is to shed light on it, which I will continue to do.
  
 
October
 
Since the U.S. Capitol had not yet reopened to public tours, the Architect of the Capitol sent my office a few links to virtual tours of the building. The Capitol is, unfortunately, still closed to tours, but you can still access the virtual tours here.
 
On October 7, I held a virtual town hall meeting with Andrew Mangione and members of the Association for Mature American Citizens (AMAC) to discuss issues facing seniors, including how I am working to protect Social Security and Medicare.
  
￼
  
￼
  
Wisconsin's world-class manufacturing industry is highlighted each year when Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce and Johnson Financial Group team up to find the ""Coolest Thing Made in Wisconsin"". Products from companies all over the state compete head-to-head in a bracket challenge until one is declared the ""Coolest Thing Made in Wisconsin"". For the second time in the contest's five year history, a product from Wisconsin's Sixth District has won! Congratulations to MuL Technologies of Mequon and their Mobile Autonomous Robotic Cart (MARC). You can watch the announcement of this year's winner here. You can also click here to see past winners.
  
￼

Remember when my Wisconsin colleagues and I sent a bipartisan letter to Navy Secretary Braithwaite in July requesting one of the submarines currently under construction be named after the Badger State? In October, he announced that one of the new Columbia-class submarines being manufactured will be named the U.S.S. Wisconsin!
 
After many years, efforts to restore the Gray Wolf population have been successful and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) announced in October that they are to be taken off the endangered species list. I have fought for this during my time in the state legislature and in Congress and am glad that it is finally coming to pass.
 
As October came to a close, we received news of a study from the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism finding that 80% of COVID-19 patients were vitamin D deficient.
  
 
November
 
The first week of November, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams joined me at the UW-Oshkosh COVID-19 surge testing site. You can read more about this testing site here and register for a test here.
  
￼
  
Those who flew for Air America during the Vietnam war were undercover, but still federal employees. Now they’re being denied retirement benefits. Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) and I teamed-up to introduce the bipartisan Air America Act, which will ensure these brave Americans receive the federal retirement benefits they deserve. You can read more by clicking here.
 
Due to COVID-19, many blood drives were canceled and the Red Cross reported a nationwide blood shortage. Donating blood, however, can still be done safely, so I went to Oshkosh to donate. If you would like to donate blood, you can visit redcross.org to find out how.
  
￼
  
 
December
 
On December 10, Morocco joined Bahrain, Sudan and the United Arab Emirates on the list of Arab countries that, just this year, have normalized relations with Israel. One thing that all of these peace agreements have in common is that they were brokered by President Trump. Israel is a sovereign country and a great American ally. However, much of the violence in the Middle-East comes from religious conflicts between Israel and other countries. Now that four countries have recognized Israel and restored their relationship, the door is open for others to follow. I applaud President Trump's leadership. He has made promises and kept them. The Middle-East is on the best pathway toward peace that I can remember in my lifetime and I look forward to seeing how the region will prosper economically and grow safer for the men, women and children who live there.
  
￼
  
Also on December 10, I joined House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Minority Whip Steve Scalise, Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney and other House Republican leaders on the steps of the Capitol to again call for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to help struggling American workers by bringing a bipartisan extension of PPP to the House floor for a vote before Christmas. The Speaker has full control of which bills make it to the House floor for a vote, so Pelosi has been the barrier to relief for the past several months. Thankfully, PPP enrollment has been reopened and businesses will once again be able to apply for these loans, which are required to go toward office expenses and employee payroll.
  
 
￼
 
  
Each year, we celebrate National Bible Week during the week of Thanksgiving. Since I was in Wisconsin that week, I joined my friend Congressman Doug Lamborn (R-CO) on the House floor to discuss the importance of the Bible and its role in American history.
  
 
￼
 
  
In light of the news that a Chinese Communist Party (CCP) spy, Christine Fang, had a close relationship with a Democrat Member of Congress, leaders of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, including myself, sent a letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray requesting an update for our committee on this and other attempts by the CCP to infiltrate our government. We received a briefing on this situation before Christmas. As Ranking Member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee's Subcommittee on National Security, I intend to get to the bottom of this situation and work to prevent other CCP spies from achieving the same success as Christine Fang.
 
It's no secret that big technology companies, like Twitter and Facebook, have been improperly censoring conservative voices and suppressing news stories that may harm Democrats. That is why I joined my colleagues in calling for an emergency hearing to ask these CEOs why they are censoring some people and not others.
 
While 2020 wasn't at all what we expected, we are on a path toward defeating COVID-19 and returning to excellence. I look forward to what 2021 has in store and will continue to fight for you in Washington.
 
If you have any questions please don’t hesitate to reach out to my offices in Fond du Lac and Washington. If you enjoyed this newsletter be sure to forward it to your family and friends so they can stay informed on what I’m doing in Washington and the Sixth District.

Today is my last day serving as your advocate in the U.S. House of Representatives. Representing you has been the opportunity of a lifetime. Suzanne and I will treasure the memories we have made during this chapter of our lives, all of which made possible by each of you, forever. 

Tomorrow, Colonel August Pfluger will be sworn in as the new Representative for the 11th District of Texas. He is a good, God-fearing veteran with a terrific family and an impressive work ethic. I've got really high hopes and expectations for him. Moving forward, if you need help with a federal agency or have any concerns regarding legislative policy, his office will be your contact.

Please continue the good fight as keepers of this republic. I hope to see you soon.

Thank You, Texas 11 For Allowing Me To Serve

Originally Published in the Midland Reporter-Telegram
December 12, 2020

The 11th District is special. We produce over 40% of our nation’s energy, train over 13,000 intelligence professionals from each branch of our military, and raise and grow the agriculture products that feed and clothe this nation.

But more than that, it is home to the absolute best people in the world.

The people of the 11th District are kind, hardworking, honest Texans who have welcomed me with open arms and trusted me to do right by them as their Member of Congress for the past 16 years.

Trust is held in high regard in West Texas, and I have been honored to have that trust. No Member of Congress gets to do what I have been able to do by themselves. It simply doesn't happen. I owe a special thank you to my wife, Suzanne Conaway, without whom none of this would be possible. But there are hundreds and hundreds of people across District 11 that have also played a direct role in the successes I have had in Congress.

Thank you to every person in this district who has come to a town hall, stopped me in a Rosa’s restaurant dining room, called my office, or relied on me to advocate for their best interests in Congress.

Our Nation is up against some incredible challenges. We face a looming, pending debt crisis that will soon swamp this country, a virus that threatens to wreck our way of life, and a great power competition with China and Russia.

But I personally don't believe those are the most immediate threats that confront our Nation.

The United States faces a moral decline and the inability to self-govern. John Adams wrote that only a moral and religious people can, in fact, self-govern. This form of governance is unsuitable for anyone else.

There are things going on in this country that God simply cannot bless. We use the words “God bless you” and “God bless this country” often. We sing it in songs. We use it particularly casually. But each time you hear those three words, “God bless America,” think about what we are asking God to bless—whether what is going on in this nation is, in fact, bless-able.

Since 1973, we have killed over 62 million babies in the United States alone. God can't bless a nation that continues along that path. At some point in time, He is going to say enough is enough, and He will put the United States through the same crucible that he put the nation of Israel through in the Old Testament when they were going along a similarly destructive path. I fear that is coming upon us. There is a solution, though.

The solution lies in the promise that God has made us in 2 Chronicles 7:14, which says, “If my people, who are called by my name, will humble themselves, turn from their wicked ways, seek my face, and pray, I will hear them from Heaven, I will forgive their sins, and I will heal their land.”

I argue that short of the Civil War, our Nation has never needed healing more than we do today. We must as individuals, as communities, and as a Nation, claim this promise.

My time in Congress has been the absolute highlight of my professional career. I will miss the colleagues who have turned into friends, and my staff who has become family. I will miss driving the backroads of all 29 counties in this great district, but most of all, I will miss you—the people of the 11th District of Texas, who have shown me grace and trust these sixteen years.

God bless each one of you, God bless Texas, and may God continue to bless the United States of America.

Sincerely, 
￼
Rep. Mike Conaway, 11th District

1/2/21 9:54,New Year. New Opportunities - Part 1,"￼ 

January 2, 2021 
Dear Fellow Marylander, 
Happy New Year! We’ve scraped through what possibly was the longest and most consequential year of our lives.
As we look at 2020 in the rearview mirror, we also look to the year ahead with optimism tinged with the knowledge that things likely will get worse before they get better. 
Our nation is facing record-high deaths, hospitalizations, and COVID-19 cases in our country. Our hospitals are being stretched to capacity. We are now on track to surpass 400,000 lives lost to the virus before the end of January. 
Unfortunately, because not everyone has followed the basic public health guidelines of wearing a mask, staying six feet from someone outside your household and washing hands frequently, we have to anticipate that infections from holiday outings and gatherings soon will produce growing case counts – and a soaring death toll. Even though we are beginning to roll out the revolutionary vaccines that the scientific community has delivered in an incredibly short time, it may not be until spring that we begin to see significant improvements in our overall public health threshold.   
Our highest priority for 2021 is finally to execute a comprehensive, coordinated federal response to turn the tide against COVID-19. I know this is the highest priority for President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, both of whom will be sworn into office on January 20 
The Biden-Harris administration will need to clean up the deadly mess left behind by President Trump. For starters, the current plan to distribute vaccines is falling behind so badly that we are nowhere near 20 million vaccinations by the end of the year, as promised. 
As the new Congress is sworn into office tomorrow (January 3), my colleagues and I should be ready to work with the new administration and support its efforts to confront this virus fully and properly. The rapid, widespread distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine is quite possibly the greatest operational challenge we have faced as a nation. Congress must give the new administration the resources it needs to save American lives. 
This country cannot achieve an economic recovery, or make needed progress on countless other pressing issues, until we course-correct toward a public health recovery. But delivering that will take far more than getting appropriate amounts of vaccines, distributed equitably and free of charge, to every community in the country.
Emerging from the pandemic also will require a massive public education campaign to amplify the importance of getting vaccinated. Not only do we need to overcome the natural hesitation to get a needle in the arm, we must combat the effects of the chronic misinformation from those who diminish the lethality of the virus or dismiss it as “just the flu."" 
We also must encourage and embrace bold executive actions, like the use of the Defense Production Act, to meet the pandemic’s continued public health and economic challenges. Similar to the regional problems faced in March and April, currently, many frontline medical personnel nationwide are dealing with critical day-to-day shortages of personal protective equipment and therapeutic supplies; shortfalls in testing continue to delay diagnoses; and there are acute needs in the realm of vaccine materials that need to be addressed immediately.
While President Trump primarily used the Defense Production Act to shield companies from the threat of lawsuits from workers who may become infected, my sincere hope is that the new Biden-Harris administration will use the tools they have to truly elevate the public health, not corporate liability protections
Like so many other things, the Trump administration also has been erratic in its consultation with all governors nationwide, leading to critical communication breakdowns in several states that are slowing vaccine and medical supply distribution. This often-partisan dynamic must cease immediately. I am heartened to see a series of bipartisan conversations underway between President-Elect Biden and governors from across the country, and I trust that these essential exchanges will continue.    
We must inject a renewed spirit of action for the collective good. Wearing a mask must be automatic. Social distancing, however challenging, has to be our continued modus operandi.  And “wash your hands” must remain our mantra.
This pandemic is not insurmountable. Its effects have been devastating, and its shadow long. But we can emerge from it. I know we can. Finally having a true partner and leader in the White House will go a long way toward easing America’s suffering. 
This will be in the front of my mind next week when the House and Senate will meet in a joint session to officially receive and count the electoral votes that confirm the election of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.
I’ve likely never welcomed a new year – or a new administration – quite so fervently. 
Thank you for joining me in helping to change the momentum of this pandemic, and this nation.
Your friend and public servant,

January 02, 2021 
Hello,  I hope you've had a happy holiday season and I wish you a very happy new year.
2020 was a difficult year for all of us. We’ve all made tremendous sacrifices. As New Yorkers, we all have lost someone or know someone who’s lost a person close to them. We have family, neighbors or friends who've served as frontline workers throughout the pandemic. Yet, despite these exceptional circumstances, we’ve also risen to the challenge and come together to overcome whatever this year has thrown our way. I could not be more proud of our community and the selfless and giving nature of so many of you. I could not be more proud of your courage, fighting for systemic change even during a pandemic. 
 
VACCINE
Thankfully, as we now head into the new year, there is now light at the end of the tunnel, with a vaccine already being distributed, first by greatest need and soon available to all who will take it.
I understand that many, particularly in communities like ours, have been skeptical of the vaccine. There are historical reasons for some of that mistrust – the Tuskegee study comes to mind. There’s also been inconsistent information from leadership, where science has been second to politics. But rest assured, there have been no safety shortcuts with the vaccine, the science has been followed throughout its approval process.
￼
(Getting the Pfizer vaccine administered)

Just this month, I along with my colleagues in Congress took the first of two vaccine doses to demonstrate its safety. Not only did I not feel anything during its administration, I felt fine immediately afterwards. I even went to my workout and jogged for 4 miles. That is not to say there can be no side-effects. The safety studies have shown that some local soreness, fatigue and even a mild fever can be common side-effects. But there is no question that these are preferable to the potentially fatal consequences of COVID-19.
Remember, consult with your doctor and make your determination. Remember that there is no conclusive evidence that the vaccine itself will prevent spread of the virus, only that it will prevent clinical symptoms of COVID-19. We’ll have to continue wearing masks, likely even after getting vaccinated, until the vaccine is accessible to all who will take it.
I’ve had the pleasure of hosting Dr. Masci on my weekly Facebook Live Town Hall, and you can watch his explanation of the vaccine here.
￼
(Weekly Facebook Live Update, featuring Dr. Masci of Elmont Hospital to update on the vaccine)
COVID Relief Bill
When the House passed the HEROES Act in the summer, we included nearly $3 trillion in relief, which included funding for SNAP, nearly a trillion in state and local aid, $75 billion in housing assistance, $25 billion for the U.S. Postal Service, $175 billion for testing and health expenses, and much more. I believe that a massive relief package is necessary to help families struggling to stay in their homes and put food on their tables, as well as the businesses that have been shutting down permanently as a result of this pandemic.
However, what we were able to negotiate this December is a short term relief-package that will do some good now before we pass a larger relief bill under the next administration.
The negotiated bill includes:
	•	$600 stimulus checks per adult making under $75,000 a year, and per child.
	•	Enhanced unemployment insurance, adding $300 a week on top of the UI claim. It would expand UI for gig workers and freelancers.
	•	$25 billion in rental assistance
	•	$70 billion in health funding
	•	Funding for vaccine distribution, testing and tracing.
	•	$284 billion in forgivable Paycheck Protection Program loans (PPP), expanding eligibility for these small business loans to small cultural institutions like local newspapers, broadcasters and theaters.
	•	$13 billion for SNAP.
We will have to do much more in the next Congress to provide relief to struggling Americans, as well as address the urgent need to support states and localities who are in the red due to revenue shortfalls and their COVID responses.
Black Lives Matter
When I reflect back on this year, I am still moved by the overwhelming passion, commitment and intensity that protestors across the United States have shown in demanding police reform.  Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor. Their tragic deaths have pushed America to once again reckon with the racism entrenched in our systems, particularly in law enforcement.
￼
(Marching with the community after George Floyd's death at the hands of law enforcement)

As I marched with the community during the spring and summer months, I was inspired by how diverse that movement was and is. There were protestors of every color and creed, overwhelmingly young, marching in lockstep against police brutality and for justice.  
￼
(Marching with the community in Rockaway for police reform)
               I’m proud to have worked with my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus to pass in the House of Representatives the landmark Justice in Policing Act, the first ever comprehensive bill package that would increase transparency and hold law enforcement accountable. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and the next administration to see this bill passed into law.
￼

House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairmanship
This December I was honored to be elected by my colleagues to Chair of House Foreign Affairs Committee, the first African American to serve as Chairman of that committee. COVID this year has shown how interconnected the world has grown to be. The greatest issues we face are global in scope, not just with this pandemic or the next, but with a climate crisis looming on the horizon. As Chair of this committee, I will work to help repair our relationships with our allies to address the challenges ahead of us, form new partnerships, return to diplomacy and focus our foreign affairs on parts of the world that have not historically been the committee’s focus, like Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa.
￼
(Holding a hearing with the House Foreign Affairs Committee early this year regarding Iran)
The voice that I bring, is the voice of a person who represents Nassau and Queens, which is a mini U.N. in and of itself. We are not a monolithic community, we are comprised of over 200 cultures and languages, with varying perspectives and backgrounds. That diversity is our strength, and that strength will be invaluable as we work with the global community for the next era of US foreign policy.
House Financial Services Committee
When I assumed the chairmanship of the Consumer Protection and Financial Institutions Subcommittee in February 2019, I made it clear that I would focus my chairmanship on shining a light on the plight of low income, marginalized communities, and in particular communities of color that continue to bear the burden of redlining and systemic discrimination. 
In addition to a series of hearings on these issues, I introduced key pieces of legislation that if passed would accomplish generations change in leveling the playing field for communities of color that continue to be held back economically as a result of a biased financial system that often makes the American dream unattainable. 
 
These include:
	•	 The Improving Corporate Governance Through Diversity Act of 2019, which requires listed companies to publish data on the diversity of their boards and senior management,
	•	The Ensuring Diversity in Community Banking Act and the Jobs and Neighborhood Investment Act, which mobilize much-needed deposits and capital to Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs) and Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs). This pandemic has shown how important MDIs and CDFIs are for serving unbanked and underbanked communities, many who would’ve been unable to access financial services like the PPP loans passed in our COVID relief bill.
	•	The Disclose Police Brutality Bonds Act of 2020, which brings transparency to Wall Street profits structuring and trading bonds for policy departments paying for the brutality and human rights violations of citizens in their custody.
	•	The Payday and Predatory Loans Moratorium Act of 2020, which suspends abusive collection practices of the payday industry while Americans suffer in the face of a devastating pandemic. 
￼
(Hosting the first ever field hearing for the Financial Services Committee in Jamaica, Queens)
Just before COVID, I also held the Financial Service Committee’s first ever field-hearing right here in Jamaica regarding the need to modernize CRA and create access to credit for communities that have historically been banking deserts.
 

2021 and the 117th Congress
2021 will bring many new opportunities to do more for our community, our nation, and the world. It is my honor to represent New York's 5th Congressional district, and am thankful every day for the opportunity to serve.
Thank you, and have a blessed new year.

Additional COVID-19 Relief
Last week, I voted in favor of additional COVID-19 relief. While this was not a perfect bill by any means, this bill provides $280 billion in Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to keep small businesses open along with providing direct relief to the American people. It also provides $13 billion to farmers, ranchers, and the agriculture sector. This week, I was glad to vote in favor of increasing the Economic Impact Payments in that bill from $600 to $2,000. The needs of American families and small businesses have been my priority since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. I applaud Congressional leadership and the Trump administration for their hard work to get a deal made. There is still more work to be done to get on the other side of this pandemic, but these bills are a great start.

NEW VIDEO: Reflections on 40 years of 99 county meetings
￼
For 40 years, I’ve crisscrossed Iowa, holding Q&As in every county, every year. My 99 county meetings keep me in touch with Iowans so I can bring their ideas to the policy-making tables in Washington.  
Q&A: Counterfeit Vaccines and Pandemic Fraud
￼
Q: What are you doing to protect taxpayer dollars included in the pandemic relief laws? 
Q: Do you have pandemic fraud on your radar that Iowans ought to be watching out for? 
Quick Links
While this past year has been challenging for us all, serving the people of Iowa is my first priority and it’s an honor that I take seriously. As chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and through my extensive oversight efforts, my work focuses on making the government more transparent, efficient and accountable to Iowans and all Americans.

1/1/21 18:27,Stimulus Payments Are On The Way,"
￼
￼
￼

Hi unknown,

Many of our friends and neighbors are suffering. Millions are out of work, and millions more are at risk of losing their homes and life savings. With vaccines rolling out, Congress has a duty to end this nightmare by ensuring Americans have the resources they need to survive the economic damage caused by this once-in-a-century pandemic. 

The IRS has announced that the second round of stimulus checks are on their way to American taxpayers. Payments of $600 per person and $600 for qualifying children and dependents are being distributed right now. Taxpayers who have registered their direct deposit information with the IRS should receive their stimulus payment by January 4. All payments are expected to be distributed by the end of January. 

Eligibility is determined based on 2019 tax returns. Individuals who made up to $75,000 and married couples who made up to $150,000 will qualify. Additionally, mixed-status families qualify for stimulus payments.

I will continue to work to bring more relief back to struggling families in Orange County. I joined my colleagues in passing legislation to provide families with $2,000 payments and expand benefits. While this legislation has stalled in the Senate, my colleagues and I will continue working for the millions of families in need of help. 

In the meantime, if you or someone you know is experiencing difficulties with their stimulus check or is struggling due to the pandemic, my office is here to help. For official updates, to find food assistance, or get help, please call my office at (714) 559-6190 or visit my website. 

We are with you.

Respectfully,
￼

P.S. I work for you. If you ever need help right away with the federal government – anything from backlogged Veterans’ benefits to stalled tax refunds—please contact my office at (714) 559-6190. You’re also welcome to contact my office to share your concerns on any issue.

Looking Ahead to the New Year 🎉  
￼
￼
￼
￼
2020 has been a tough year for so many. I pray the upcoming new year brings you and your family many blessings. 

Isaiah 43:18-19 tells us: “Remember not the former things, nor consider the things of old. Behold, I am doing a new thing; now it springs forth, do you not perceive it? I will make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert.""

Addressing the Covid Surge in the Coastal Bend
￼
￼
￼
￼
I led two letters along with Congressman Vicente Gonzales and Congressman Henry Cuellar to the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Defense, the Texas Division of Emergency Management, and the Texas Department of State Health Services requesting additional personnel and resource support in order to address the COVID-19 surge in the Coastal Bend region.

From the letters: ""At this time, there are no state or federal resources being directly deployed in South Texas, and we have seen a notable uptick in COVID-related hospitalizations. The hospitals in our districts need clarity on what staffing resources they can depend on in the coming days and weeks should this uptick continue.""

Additional personnel and resources will assist in alleviating the burden placed on our frontline workers. The rapid deployment of additional federal resources would go a long way to alleviate and augment the local response as we continue to experience increases in COVID-19 cases.

My Legislation Supporting Small Business Owners

Small businesses are the backbone of our nation and a key component of the American Dream is being able to take a risk, work hard, and determine one’s outcomes in life. And as we take stock of the lessons to be learned and look ahead to a new year, we should look now for ways to help businesses be better prepared to weather the next crisis.

That's why I introduced the Small Business Emergency Savings Account Act in October to help American businesses better prepare for the future and develop a built-in resiliency to deal with unexpected crises. Read more in my op-ed linked HERE.

Honoring the Memory of Mrs. Susan Day
￼
￼
￼
￼
I spoke on the House Floor earlier this month in honor of Mrs. Susan Day, a beloved teacher in the Corpus Christi community, who passed away on October 5th, 2020.

Mrs. Day was a passionate and dedicated educator at Calallen High School who retired this past May after 36 years of service to our community. The English Department recognized her with a plaque declaring the English hallway, a place she spent so much time with her students, to be the Susan Day Hallway. Now, to honor her passing, her former students are petitioning to have that name change made permanent.

Susan Day was an amazing member of our community who has touched the lives of hundreds of students, parents, and teachers. I offer my condolences to her family, friends, and students as they grieve the loss of a great woman. She will be fondly remembered by all.
￼

On This Day in History
￼
￼
￼
￼
On this day in history in 1845, Texas officially joined the United States of America, becoming the 28th state.

May God continue to bless Texas!

Foxx Report
 
Effective January 3rd, the new county lines for North Carolina’s Fifth District will come into effect. For those who receive my weekly newsletter, I encourage you to visit the North Carolina General Assembly’s website to confirm where your address lies within these new district lines.
As always, I will continue to provide you with the most pertinent information on what’s before the House of Representatives as well as important happenings within the Fifth District. 
A Year In Review
For my final newsletter of 2020, I want to share with you some top-of-mind accomplishments from this past year. To be frank, the 116th Congress has been deadlocked over hyper-partisan divides that have been stoked by Washington Democrats, but that has not deterred me in my fight for commonsense solutions and delivering for the proud citizens of North Carolina’s Fifth District. Here are a few notable accomplishments that I’d like to share with you:
Great Act Signed into Law
On December 30th of 2019, President Trump signed H.R. 150, the Grant Reporting Efficiency and Agreements Transparency (GREAT) Act into law. Representative Jimmy Gomez (D-CA) and I authored this piece of landmark legislation to develop a standardized, government-wide reporting system for federal grant recipients. For too long, federal grant reporting has relied on outdated, ineffective reporting methods that require nonprofit groups - serving their communities - to divert valuable working hours to fill out tedious, redundant paperwork. This legislation will bring unprecedented transparency and efficiency to approximately $650 billion in annual federal spending.
Eliminating Surprise Medical Bills
This past Sunday, President Trump signed the latest Coronavirus relief bill, and included within it is a bipartisan solution to eliminate the financially crippling practice of surprise medical billing and provides patients with increased transparency, so they are empowered to make the best health care choices for themselves and their families. This solution was based upon H.R. 5800, the Ban Surprise Billing Act, a bill I coauthored with Chairman Bobby Scott.  Patients should not be penalized with these outrageous bills simply because they were rushed to an out-of-network hospital or unknowingly treated by an out-of-network provider at an in-network facility. This is a win for patients and their families that will improve America’s health care system.
A Sizable Win for Visually Impaired Workers
In August, H.R. 4920, the VA Contracting Preference Consistency Act, was signed into law by President Trump. I was immensely proud to serve as an original cosponsor of this critical legislation.
In North Carolina’s Fifth District, dozens of blind or visually impaired individuals have faced the prospect of losing their jobs due to conflicting federal laws. For those workers, that opportunity was provided through the AbilityOne program. AbilityOne was enacted by Congress to help those who have trouble finding work due to circumstances outside of their own control. This program gives nonprofit companies that employ the blind and significantly disabled individuals preferential treatment in competing for certain federal procurement contracts. One such nonprofit is IFB Solutions, which employed those workers here in the Fifth District.
Unfortunately, previous court decisions have cost IFB Solutions the three federal contracts that supported those blind workers. This is because of an unnecessary conflict between AbilityOne and a similar program, the Veterans First program, which sets aside some Department of Veterans Affairs contracts for service-disabled veteran owned small businesses. The AbilityOne program has been exempted from such programs in order to not put programs for veterans and programs for the blind in conflict with each other. However, when Congress passed the Veterans Benefits Act of 2006 to create the Veterans First program, it neglected to exempt the AbilityOne program.
With the passage of H.R. 4920, nonprofits including IFB Solutions will have the opportunity to continue to work for the VA if they held contracts that predate the Veterans Benefits Act of 2006.
The Pandemic Preparedness, Response, and Rapid Recovery Act
The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed burdensome regulations that have exacerbated a myriad of problems within the United States. Without question, the Pandemic Preparedness, Response and Rapid Recovery Act is an obligatory, bicameral initiative from Congress to cut bureaucratic red tape that hampers recovery from the damaging health and economic effects of COVID-19 and future pandemics. I was proud to work alongside Representative James Comer (R-KY), Senator James Lankford (R-OK), Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI), and Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) to introduce this important legislation so that economic growth and America’s workforce will remain resilient.
War Crimes Rewards Expansion Act
On December 3rd, the House of Representatives passed my bill, H.R. 1819, the War Crimes Rewards Expansion Act. This important legislation helps clarify that rewards under the War Crimes Rewards Program can also be allocated for prosecutions that fall under domestic law – including U.S. law or the law of another country – in addition to the laws of international tribunals. With its passage, the United States Government, and governments across the world, take a leap forward in the pursuit of justice. 
Have a blessed weekend.
Sincerely,
￼

Dear Lindsey: 
Contra Costa is always at the heart of my work in Congress. During this unpcredented year, my staff and I continued to find ways to connect with you. As we embark on a new year, I am proud to share a report of our community engagement, legislative efforts, and constituent services. We look forward to continuing to serve you and our community in 2021. As always, if we can be assistance to you or your family, please do not hesitate to contact my office.

This Coming Year
 
 
This is a perfect time to reflect on where we have been over the year and look forward to our hopes and goals in the coming year. As we begin to put a tough year behind us, I wanted to take a moment to tell you about my priorities as I fight for our district in the new Congress starting in 2021.
 
As always, the safety and security of hard-working people in our community is my number one priority as your elected official. As we enter into 2021, the first order of business must be coming together to address the health and economic crisis we face as a country. In the latest stimulus deal we passed, we made a down payment on COVID-19 relief; I believe we must come back to the table immediately in January to address the scale of this
￼
crisis and solve challenges we left unsolved in that bill. I will be fighting to provide hard-working people with direct cash payments of $2,000 per month until this crisis is over. As officials have begun distributing the vaccine in Ohio and across the country, I will also be working to ensure the vaccine distribution is run efficiently and effectively so everyone has access to it.
 
As you likely know, I sit on the House Appropriations Committee, which has allowed me to bring back hundreds of millions of dollars for our community over my tenure in Congress. Because of my seniority on the committee, this year I look forward to moving into the Vice-Chair position on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. This position will allow me to help support local defense-related projects in our district and bring more money back to the State of Ohio. 
 
I will also continue to serve as Chair of the House Manufacturing Caucus where I plan to prioritize manufacturing and innovation at the federal level. I look forward to introducing legislation to establish an office in the White House to shape manufacturing policies and to prepare our future workforce so they can learn the skills necessary to compete in forward-thinking industries. That will not only help Ohioans secure more good-paying jobs, but it will help our country lead in the economy of the future. 
 
Finally, I plan to work across the aisle to create an infrastructure bill. This basic investment in our country will make good on years of promises: repairing our crippled roads and bridges, clearing out blight in our communities, and expanding broadband so every American has access to affordable highspeed internet.
 
While I’m working on these priorities in Washington, it’s important to me that you know I’m serving you. My offices are a resource should you need help with Social Security benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans benefits, visas, tax refunds, and more, my staff is a phone call away to answer your questions and help you out. Additionally, I am always interested in hearing what my constituents think of the serious issues we face as a country. Should you have questions, comments, or concerns about the work we are doing in Washington, please don’t hesitate to call by phone or submit the written form on my website.
 
Serving our community is the honor of my lifetime. I look forward to a successful and prosperous coming year for Northeast Ohio.
 
Best,
￼
Tim

1/1/21 13:01,Blaine’s Bulletin: New Year & COVID Package,"￼ 
January 1, 2021
For Immediate Release | Contact: Georgeanna Sullivan (202) 225-2956 

BLAINE’S BULLETIN: NEW YEAR & COVID PACKAGE
On December 21, Congress passed another historic rescue package that President Trump has signed into law to aid in our nation’s continued recovery and help get 2021 started off on the right foot. This bill was months in the making and, while not perfect, it contains several critical provisions that will allow us to safely reopen Missouri businesses, get students and teachers back in the classroom, and make vaccines available to at-risk individuals, medical workers, first responders, and every Missourian who wants one. 
First and foremost, the new law provides nearly $20 billion in health care funding for vaccine production and $8.75 billion for distribution across the county at little-to-no expense to patients. The dissemination of the vaccine is one of the final steps in helping our nation resume regular life and gives the at-risk and vulnerable populations the capability to live without fear. The law also supports families and individuals who have been hit hard by the pandemic’s economic impact. While many Missourians have been able to return to work, unfortunately not everyone has had this option. Unemployment coverage has been expanded and another round of stimulus checks for individuals making under $75,000 and couples making under $150,000 began going out this week. The Child Care and Development Block Program will also be bolstered by $10 billion to help ease the burden of child care for parents whose children may not be back at school full time but are returning to work. And the Education Stabilization Fund is increased by $82 billion to provide emergency funding for schools and universities, helping our students get back to full-time, in-person learning and making sure they are equipped for difficult situations moving forward. 
For the many farmers and ranchers who call the Third District home, the USDA’s Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) will receive more funding to help those whose operations have been interrupted by the pandemic. While schools were closed, lack of broadband access caused a major problem for students who were learning from home. The new law includes a broadband deployment program to provide increased broadband infrastructure in rural and underserved communities in Missouri and across the country. Another big help for rural Missouri is the increased telehealth funding to ensure all Missourians have access to health care no matter their zip code.
As the incoming top Republican on the House Small Business Committee, I am especially pleased to report the reopening and strengthening of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Businesses here in Missouri and across the nation have suffered enough, and after months of asking Speaker Pelosi to release the remaining aid, more help is finally on the way. This bill provides more than $280 billion to revamp the PPP and get struggling businesses back on their feet. It has been targeted to make sure that the businesses and industries who need it most – like those with 300 employees or less and the restaurant and hotel industry – are eligible for a second round. And the once burdensome and expensive loan forgiveness process has been streamlined and simplified for all loans under $150,000. These businesses have been through enough, and asking them to go through bureaucratic red tape and legal fees to have their loans forgiven goes against the purpose of emergency aid. It will also prevent small businesses that have received PPP funds from being taxed for accepting help. Small businesses are the heart and soul of America, and it will be my mission as the leading Republican on the Small Business Committee to help them recover and get back to thriving. 
There is no denying 2020 was a difficult year, but with the New Year comes a fresh start. It is my sincere belief this COVID relief package is the first step toward a healthy and prosperous 2021. I’m looking forward to getting to work for you in 117th Congress in just a couple of days. On behalf of Jackie and my family, I wish you and yours a very Happy New Year!

January 1, 2021


Hello Baby New Year, Am I Glad to See You! 

Father Time has left the building, and good riddance. What a year it wasn’t. Adios 2020! COVID_19 claimed millions of lives worldwide and forced us into mandatory lockdowns, the likes of which we’ve never seen in our lifetimes and crippled small businesses across the U.S. Barbra Streisand sang “People” (people who need people) and Michael Jackson sang “The man in the mirror.” Barbra was right; people who need people are the luckiest people in the world but unfortunately for many this year, the man in the mirror was their only form of companionship. Social distancing and working from home are getting long of tooth. The calendar says 2021, however 2020 is etched in our brains. Our Constitution mandates that the swearing-in day for new members of Congress be the 3rd day of January but it allows us to change it as mandated by law, perhaps so we could avoid the very situation we find ourselves in now: a rare Sunday start to the 117th Congress. Nevertheless, a bipartisan, bicameral deal to move the swearing-in day to January 4th wasn’t reached, so we find ourselves swearing in all members of Congress on a Sunday.
 Hypocrisy appears to be another theme that just won’t die in 2021, as Speaker Pelosi has had a convenient change of heart surrounding her terribly misguided and unconstitutional proxy voting that was allowed for the first time ever in 2020. That’s right you don’t even have to show up for work anymore, just have a buddy cast your votes by proxy on the house floor. However for some unknown reason she has decided that voting for Speaker is so important that all members must be present and vote in person on Jan. 3rd. Don’t worry though, it’s only a one time thing so members can re-elect her as Speaker of the House. That’s right, Pelosi thinks it’s okay to vote on critical legislation like COVID-relief, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), funding the government, legalizing marijuana, and any other bill remotely, but she places a high level of importance on a vote that lets her keep the speakership, which therefore must be done in person. Glad to see she’s got her priorities in order.
You can also look forward to more changes as we face redistricting this year. A nationwide realignment of congressional seats. Some states will have less members of Congress after the 2022 election and some will have more. If you remember in 2012 Missouri had 9 Congressmen but only 8 in 2013 which is the number we have today. Redistricting could determine which party has a Majority in Congress for the foreseeable future. Every ten years, following the results of the US census, congressional districts are redrawn to reflect the changes in population within each state. The Constitution provides for proportional representation of the 435 members of Congress. This year, analytics suggest that roughly 27% of House seats will likely be drawn by Republicans at the state level and 11% will be drawn by Democrats. 30% will likely be determined by independent commissions or by both Republicans and Democrats working together; seven states such as Alaska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wyoming, etc., have only one member of Congress so consequently, the border of those states reflect their congressional district. Should redistricting go the Democrats’ way, they could secure leadership in the House for another decade and continue to push their radical policies through the People’s House rather than actually voting on legislation our constituents care about. Democrats have had control of the House for 2 years, and they’ve already demonstrated that they’re out of touch with the American people. Helping them pick up seats by redrawing congressional lines will only embolden their radical and out-of-touch agenda.
2020 has been a crazy year, and it is my sincere hope that 2021 is the fresh start we all desperately need. While I hope Democrats surprise me by getting back to work for the American people their decisions leading into the 117th Congress aren’t exactly promising. A tiger doesn’t change it’s stripes, but the Democrats passed a bill that it is illegal to own one as a pet — if only they’d treated COVID-relief with the same urgency. Happy New Year!

Year In Review
 
 
I want to wish you and your family a Happy New Year. As we look back on 2020, there is no doubt this year will be remembered for the many challenges our community and our nation has faced. But it will also be remembered as the year where we overcame many of these challenges, celebrated the silent heroes among us, and gave pause to remember what’s truly important. In 2021, I recognize there’s more work to be done to support Central New York as we continue to address the ongoing pandemic. As your representative, I remain committed to working across party lines in Congress to deliver the necessary assistance to help our community emerge from this crisis stronger, and better than before.

 
￼ 
 
Constituent Services Recap

 
Serving Central New York in Congress has been the greatest honor of my life. Despite the many challenges this year, I’m proud to report our constituent service team remains dedicated to serving our community. In 2020 I have been proud to assist local veterans in securing long overdue medals, ensure IRS Economic Impact Payments are delivered to CNY families, and help members of our community as they encounter problems with other federal agencies like Social Security, Medicare, and the VA. If you or a loved one needs assistance, do not hesitate to contact our constituent service team at (315) 423-5657.

 ￼
 
 
Mental Health Resources

 
Especially during this holiday season, I know many in our community are struggling to cope with increased stress and anxiety. If you or a loved one is in-need of support services, please know there are resources available. For 24/7 suicide prevention and crisis support, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255). To find local alcohol, drug, or mental health treatment facilities and programs visit the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s website. For information on helping children cope with emergencies, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website.

 
Sincerely,

Dear Friend,    Thank you for subscribing to my e-newsletter; to receive issue-specific newsletters, in addition to my weekly update, click here. Also, please remember to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube for regular updates on how I am serving the people of South Carolina.     Happy New Year!   As we say goodbye to 2020, we say hello to a new year with new opportunities. I hope for the very best this coming year in so many ways. 2020 was tough, there is no way around it, and I am hopeful 2021 brings us back to normal.   Though 2020 is over, the public health crisis is not. Please continue to stay vigilant and follow the guidance of public health officials to keep you and your loved ones safe. As the vaccines are distributed across the nation, I encourage everyone to follow the health advice of your physician. I want to thank all health care workers, retail workers, grocery store clerks, and everyone who has served during this public health crisis. It’s because of your sacrifices that we have been able to survive the troubles of 2020.   I am also thankful for our men and women in uniform who continue to preserve our freedoms. Although you may not have been able to spend the holidays with your families,we are eternally grateful for your service. We’re thinking of you and hold you in our hearts as the dawn of the New Year approaches.   As always, I am grateful for another year to serve as your United States Senator. If you need assistance, I encourage you to contact my offices. My staff and I are here to serve the people of South Carolina.   I wish you all the best in the coming new year with the utmost optimism that the best is yet to come. God bless South Carolina and the United States of America! 
Sincerely,  
￼
