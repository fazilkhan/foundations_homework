2/27/21,Why I voted YES on the COVID relief package,"Dear Friend: 	Late last night, I voted YES on the $1.9 trillion dollar relief package, which passed the House and is now headed to the Senate. 	We‚Äôre in the midst of a terrible tragedy, with thousands dying every day, and millions of Americans are unemployed and struggling. There‚Äôs an urgent need to get help to families as the pace of recovery has been slowing down for months. We have to think big, and take immediate action ‚Äì and that‚Äôs exactly what this relief package will do. 	Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs in the bill, and how it can help you and your family:   Money in your pocket:¬†Another round of $1,400 direct relief checks for individuals who make less than $75,000, and $2,800 for couples who make less than $150,000.	¬†  Help for unemployed Americans:¬†Extends and increases the federal unemployment benefit, and extends the Mixed Earner Unemployment Compensation program, which I have been fighting for, to help thousands of my constituents in the entertainment industry, and who work as freelancers, contract workers, or in the gig economy.	¬†  Accelerating vaccine distribution:¬†Provides tens of billions to federal, state, and local governments to distribute, administer, and track vaccinations, so we can finally bring an end to this pandemic, as well as funding for vaccine development, and COVID-19 testing and contract tracing.	¬†  Keeping people in their homes: Provides funding for assistance for renters, people experiencing homelessness, and homeowners struggling to pay their mortgages.  	And much, much more. 	The House will also vote to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour. You may have seen that the Senate Parliamentarian ‚Äì an official appointed to oversee rules and processes in the Senate ‚Äì ruled that Congress can‚Äôt raise the minimum wage through the specific legislative mechanism we‚Äôre using to pass this relief package. But we‚Äôre still committed to raising the wages of millions of Americans, and there are discussions happening right now throughout Congress to figure out how we can get this done.¬†I am committed to making sure¬†Americans earn a living wage and can provide for their families. 	These policies are urgently needed to help American families get by as we enter the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic. They‚Äôll stimulate our economy and promote growth and recovery. And they‚Äôre widely popular, too ‚Äì with both Democrats and Republicans. 	This is a no brainer. The risk of doing too little on COVID relief far, far outweighs the risk of doing ‚Äútoo much.‚Äù 	So let‚Äôs get it done.¬† 	¬† 	Stay safe and healthy,   	Congressman Adam Schiff",S001150

Of the People, By the People, and For the People
￼
For nearly a quarter of a millennium, American government of the people, by the people, for the people has endured – and we have witnessed the peaceful transfer of power that makes us unique in world history. This lasting success was not pre-ordained; our fledgling experiment in self-government has had to contend with wars and diseases, economic depressions and internal divisions. Through it all, the flame of democracy was protected by generations of patriots, public servants, and everyday citizens who put the long-term health of the nation ahead of short-term personal gain. Now, it is our turn to do the same.
Our nation is facing immense challenges. A pandemic that has already killed over 400,000 Americans, and still grows worse by the day. A floundering economy that is forcing too many Americans to make unimaginable choices. A divided nation, where a few conflict-seeking voices on the fringes seem to drown out the majority who long for compromise. In the middle of these crises and more, we cannot simply settle into business-as-usual.
￼
At this urgent juncture, I find myself turning to the words of one of our nation’s greatest citizens. As President Abraham Lincoln worked to preserve the Union during its most delicate time, he urged Congress to rise to the moment, stating: ‘The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present. The occasion is piled high with difficulty and we must rise with the occasion. As our case is new, we must think anew and act anew. We must disenthrall ourselves, and then we shall save our country.'
More than 150 years later, it’s impossible to summarize this moment in American history, or the proper response, any better than Lincoln did. It’s time to think anew, and act anew, because we cannot allow our usual petty squabbles to hinder our response to the threats we face. I believe that President Biden has the opportunity, the ability, and the character to unify our nation and make this government work for its people. Now, Congress must do its part, and come together on a bipartisan basis to improve the country we all love so dearly. As President Lincoln said: it’s time to rise with the occasion.

'An American Independent’: Maine Values on Display on 60 Minutes 
￼
(via @anguskingmaine on Instagram) 
Just before Christmas, a “60 Minutes” crew from CBS came to Brunswick to talk about the state of our politics, how to make the Senate work better, and what’s so special about Maine. The second part of the interview was to take place in Washington sometime after the new year—and turned out to be the morning after the insurrection at the Capitol.
￼
I won’t try to recount the content we discussed, but wanted to share a little of what this experience was like. First, they had done their homework, even going back to my not-so-illustrious career in high school football, what it was like to be an Independent Governor, a lot about Joshua Chamberlain (which didn’t make it into the 15 minutes), and why the Senate can’t seem to get much done. The nerve-wracking part of this process is that we talked for more than four hours, but I knew they were only going to use 15 minutes. So the question I wondered about leading up to Sunday night was, which 15 minutes? 
￼
(via @anguskingmaine on Instagram) 
There’s no script for something like this—you just have to answer the questions. But what they chose to close out the show was a good summary of how I try to work, “We just have to keep ringing the bell of common sense.""
Here are a few other key quotes from the interview: 
	•	The President’s responsibility for the Capitol insurrection: ""Words have consequences, and the higher up you are on the hierarchy, the words have more and more consequences. And the President of the United States has the bully pulpit.""   
	•	Maine’s culture of community: ""If you’re in a small town and if you’re in a business, repeat business is all there is. You’ve got to, as we say up here, use people right, or they’re not gonna come back. That engenders a sense of community, and relationship, and sort of reciprocity of good will."" 
	•	On the merits of being an Independent in the Senate: ""It sort of liberates you, because you don’t have to do what the party says. You don’t have to worry about the party’s major contributors being mad at you. I just try to look for common sense solutions, what will work.  That’s what I’m interested in, rather than ideology.""

January 6th: Insurrection at the U.S. Capitol
￼
(via @anguskingmaine on Instagram) 
I hate this picture but felt it should be shared. I walked up to the Capitol last week to thank the Maine National Guard detachment who had come down to help secure the Capitol after the riot on January 6–and for me, this shot captured the profound sadness of where we find ourselves as a country.
January 6th was one of the darkest days our democratic system has faced. Tomorrow, and every day after, must be better, because the freedoms enshrined by our founders are not self-perpetuating; their vision, and our Constitution requires each of us to put the long-term health of our nation above short-term political interests. If we are to ensure that government of the people, by the people, and for the people does not perish from the Earth, we need to protect it in word and deed. We must move forward together – not as warring factions, but as one nation.
￼
Books could be written about what happened that day (and I’m sure they will be), but it comes down to our loss of consensus on what is true and a related loss of confidence in the sources of that truth. When I was young, everyone got their facts from one person—Walter Cronkite. We could argue about what do about those facts, but rarely about the facts themselves. Now facts and non-facts (a polite term for lies) come at us from all directions, and because human nature pushes us toward those sources we already tend to agree with (I’m told this is called “confirmation bias”), we dig ever further into our self-made information foxholes.
The result is a profoundly divided country that can’t even agree on who got more votes in an election. There’s plenty of blame to go around for this, beginning with those with large megaphones who deliberately misinform and mislead. But there will always be demagogues and charlatans (and Facebook and Twitter); the deeper cause is our failure to adapt to this new information-tsunami age. We have to become better consumers of news—more critical, more curious, more willing to take extra steps (like seeking a diversity of news sources) to get at the truth. The truth will indeed set us free, but these days we all have to work a little harder to find it.


January Legislative Update
￼
	•	Joined a bipartisan group of Senators and the Administration to strategize on vaccine distribution throughout the U.S. Last week’s meeting was a cordial, bipartisan conversation focused on identifying the best policies to support the American people during this crisis. I’m hoping more congressional members will join our group as we all work together to get these vital resources to all Americans. Read more HERE.
	•	Voted to confirm President Biden’s nominees for key national security positions. I have confidence that with cabinet members like Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, and Director of National Intelligence, Avril Haines, the President will be well equipped to mitigate and prevent threats to our national security.
	•	Prepared the incoming Administration with guidance for cyberthreats. I serve as co-chair of the Cyberspace Solarium Commission (CSC) with Congressman Mike Gallagher (R-Wis), and last week we prepared a roadmap towards a stronger cyberdefense posture for the Biden Administration. Read more HERE.
	•	Recognized Maine’s strategic importance in the Arctic region. The U.S. Navy recently-released A Strategic Blueprint for the Arctic., a publication that represents a forward-thinking approach to achieving U.S. priorities in the Arctic, and stresses Maine’s critical strategic importance in the region. I sent a letter to top Navy officials to commend them for recognition of Maine’s leadership. Read more HERE.

Honoring Martin Luther King, Jr. 
On August 28, 1963, I sat perched in a tree (can you see me there, in the trees to the left of Dr. King?) on the National Mall and listened as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. told a crowd about his dream that one day, America would truly embody the idea that all people are created equal. His words still echo in my ears, all these years later. Dr. King spoke with clarity, passion, and unparalleled talent to remind all who would hear him of the American promise: it’s character that counts, not race, gender, religion, or national origin. His voice and his work inspired generations of Americans to recommit themselves to realize his dream. Including me. 
￼
 However, recent years have reminded us all that the work is not finished. From the continued inequities in our criminal justice system that harm Black Americans to the widespread disparities that have made Black Americans far more likely to suffer the health and economic impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, it is clear that the dream Dr. King shared nearly 60 years ago has not been fulfilled.  Dr. King famously said that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. He’s right, of course – but that only happens if good people stand up, and fight to extend the American birthright of Equal Justice Under Law to all of our people. In the days ahead, we must summon his wisdom and his drive as Americans of all backgrounds continue to work together in pursuit of a more perfect union that truly guarantees liberty and justice for all.

January Edition of Inside Maine: Bipartisanship in the 117th Congress 
￼
In the January 2021 edition of “Inside Maine” podcast, I welcomed U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) to discuss the importance of bipartisan legislating in the 117th Congress and how Congress can work together to provide vital coronavirus relief to the American people. 
The “Inside Maine Podcast” is a 30-minute program that aims to help keep Maine people informed about issues of the day, how they affect life in the state, and how they factor into my work as one of two independents in the U.S. Senate. This podcast builds on an existing radio show that airs on Newsradio WGAN in Portland, Maine between 10 and 11 a.m. on almost every last Saturday of the month.

Wicker Leads Pro-Life Push in Senate 
Americans Oppose Taxpayer Funding of Abortion 
On January 22, 1973, the Supreme Court issued a grim decision that haunts our nation to this day. In Roe v. Wade, justices threw out state laws protecting the unborn and declared abortion legal in all 50 states. This decision undercut the legislative process and the will of the American people, paving the way for injustice on a massive scale. In the years since Roe v. Wade, an estimated 62 million unborn lives have been taken. 
Pro-life Americans have not been silent amid this tragedy. Every year, scores of citizens gather in state capitals and in Washington to send a defiant but powerful message in defense of life. This year’s March for Life, which was held virtually, came at the outset of a new presidential administration that has already proved hostile to the rights of the unborn. The Biden Administration’s abortion agenda makes it all the more vital for pro-life Americans to continue speaking out. 
Tax Dollars Should Never Subsidize Abortion 
President Biden has promised to unify the country, but his recent actions on abortion reveal extreme priorities. In one of his first steps as President, Mr. Biden reversed the Mexico City policy, which had blocked taxpayer dollars from funding nonprofit groups that advocate for abortion overseas. This decision showed disregard for the consciences of millions of pro-life taxpayers who are offended by efforts to fund abortion with their tax dollars. 
The President’s decision is clearly out of step with an increasing number of Americans. Last year, a Marist poll revealed six out of 10 Americans oppose tax dollars going toward abortion. Many of these individuals identify as pro-choice, but they agree that fellow citizens who are pro-life should not have to bankroll something they find morally abhorrent. Congress has long echoed this reasonable view. For more than 40 consecutive years, lawmakers have passed the Hyde Amendment in annual spending legislation to prevent taxpayer dollars from funding abortion. 
I have called on Congress repeatedly over the years to make the Hyde Amendment permanent. I am doing so once again by introducing my No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion bill, which would ban the use of tax dollars for abortion once and for all. I am also supporting legislation to outlaw abortion of unborn babies who are capable of feeling pain. Beyond that, I am pushing hard for legislation to protect vulnerable infants who survive an abortion attempt. There is no excuse for any lawmaker to oppose such a reasonable and humane protection. 
Public Opinion Is Shifting Toward Life 
When Roe v. Wade was handed down in 1973, many Americans did not know the full extent of fetal development. But new technology has revealed stunning details inside the womb. Parents are now able to see vivid sonogram images of their pre-born children. Many grandparents, like my wife Gayle and me, have seen the feet, heartbeat, and faces of our young grandchildren waiting to enter the world. More Americans are awakening to the reality that each new life, born and unborn, is precious and worthy of protection. 
Twenty-five years ago, 56 percent of Americans identified as pro-choice and 33 percent identified as pro-life. Today, that gap has closed completely, with roughly half of Americans identifying as pro-life. Even more telling is that 81 percent of Americans oppose late-term abortion, and 65 percent oppose abortion in the second trimester. It is clear that Americans want expanded protections for the unborn. I will continue leading the fight in Congress to protect the most vulnerable members of the human family.

Congresswoman Greene Cosponsors Legislation to Prevent Hate America Flags From Flying Over American Embassies

Washington D.C. – Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene continues her America First Agenda by cosponsoring Rep. Jeff Duncan’s Old Glory Only Act (H.R. 85), which would ensure that only the American flag flies over U.S. embassies. 

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene issued the following statement:

“During my campaign for Congress, I promised that I would always put America First. That means that only the Stars and Stripes should fly over our embassies in foreign countries. President Biden's State Department has already raised a flag over our embassies that doesn't represent the vast majority of Americans.

In the past, rogue members of the State Department flew the flag of the radical Marxist group, Black Lives Matter. The domestic terrorists represented by that flag have burned down our cities with the mission of defunding our police. We should NOT be flying a flag of a group who wants to erase our history and bring mass destruction to our country through Communism.

The federal government should only be flying the flag that represents ALL people, the American flag. We need to bring back pride in our country and raise the Star Spangled Banner proudly. Old Glory represents our great American military and their sacrifices to ensure our freedom. This isn’t a political issue. This is about Patriotism, and we need more of it.""

2/1/21 11:56,Weekly Update,"￼ 


Dear West Virginian,  Yesterday, I joined a group of my Republican colleagues in the Senate and wrote to President Joe Biden to propose an alternative COVID-19 relief proposal. Our proposal reflects many of the already stated priorities by the administration, and we believe it is capable of garnering bipartisan support, which is necessary during this process. We also requested a meeting with the president to discuss the proposal in more detail. Shortly after sending the letter, my colleagues and I accepted an invitation from President Biden to meet with him at the White House today. As the process continues, I’ll be sure to keep you updated on the latest.  Speaking Up Against Executive Overreach   Last week, President Joe Biden issued several climate Executive Actions that signal America is heading backwards from energy independence toward reliance on foreign sources. Many of these decisions that were announced should be made in Congress, not dictated from a presidential order. This type of government overreach leaves rural communities and union workers in the dust, just ask those who were working on the Keystone XL pipeline. In West Virginia, we remember the effects of this playbook originally created during the Obama administration. America is a proud energy producer, and paralyzing an entire industry full of high-paying jobs and propping up hostile countries with fewer environmental regulations does little to combat global climate change and creates resentment at home.  I spoke more about these Executive Orders and my concerns on the Senate floor.

My goal with all of these discussions has been and remains to find common ground to advance West Virginia interests and priorities. Recently, I had the opportunity to question two of President Biden’s picks to lead the Department of Transportation (DOT), Mayor Pete Buttigieg, and Department of Commerce, Governor Gina Raimondo.   ￼   During both of these opportunities, I raised everything from Corridor H to the development of Virgin Hyperloop to broadband mapping to COVID-19 relief funding.  Check out my full questioning for Mayor Buttigieg here and here to watch my questions for Governor Raimondo.  Sharing West Virginia with the World   ￼    In case you missed it, the New River Gorge is now officially a National Park and Preserve! This is great news for our state, and there is no question that this designation will boost tourism and economic development in the area. Since the news has spread, people across the country have been buzzing with excitement to visit this beautiful spot right here in our backyard. Check out these articles in The Washington Post, Thrillist, Washingtonian, and Southern Living. I also penned an op-ed with Senator Joe Manchin in the Beckley Register-Herald.  COVID-19 Vaccinations in West Virginia   West Virginia has led the nation in distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and seeks to continue this effort. We have successful established vaccination sites in every one of our 55 counties and also had the first online state vaccination registration system in the nation. This success has been noticed nationwide. Check out these stories in the The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.   Now that we have shown we have the capability and the infrastructure to rapidly administer doses and given our large elderly population, it is essential the Biden administration prioritize West Virginia for additional doses in the future rounds of COVID-19 vaccine distribution. On Thursday, I worked with the other members of our Congressional Delegation to write a letter to Acting Secretary of Health and Human Services Norris Cochran and Acting Secretary of Defense David Norquist to request additional vaccines to West Virginia. See our full letter here.  If you would like to register for an appointment to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, Governor Justice has launched a website to assist with the process.

Congresswoman Beatty Celebrates Black History Month
The brainchild of Carter G. Woodson, and originally known as “Negro History Week,” February was officially recognized as Black History Month by former President Gerald Ford in 1976. Since then, we as a nation come together every year to reflect on and recognize the contributions of courageous African-American leaders and raise awareness of key historical moments in our country’s ongoing fight for equality, justice, and civil rights. Heralding 2021 Black History Month, U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03), Chair of the powerful Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), said:
“Black history is American history, and I call on all Americans to join me—before, during, and after Black History Month—in celebrating the storied history and significant contributions of countless Black Americans. This year’s celebration is all the more significant as the Congressional Black Caucus, the ‘Conscience of Congress,’ marks our 50th anniversary of fighting for the lives and livelihoods of communities of color. In that spirit, as CBC chair, I will use my voice to continue speaking truth to power and remain committed to ensuring equal justice, equality, and equity for everyone—following in the footprints of trailblazers who boldly walked before us.”
In conjunction with Black History Month, Beatty will introduce three resolutions: (1) recognizing the challenges Black veterans faced after their selfless service and emphasizing the need for the VA to continue to work to eliminate racial health and benefit disparities; (2) supporting the goals and ideals of Black History Month and honoring the outstanding contributions of the 88 African-American Medal of Honor recipients; and (3) expressing support for the issuance of a commemorative postage stamp in honor of the Buffalo Soldiers.
We owe Black veterans and soldiers, past and present, a huge debt of gratitude,” Beatty said. “All of us know that there are countless heroes and sheroes who sacrificed everything to make our Union more perfect for everyone.” She added, “I call on my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, to come together and do the same by officially recognizing that Black history is American history.” 
Throughout February, Beatty will recognize Black History Month and the people who make our country great on social media. So, please be sure to visit the Congresswoman’s Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, and don’t forget to join the conversation online by using #BlackHistoryMonth and #BHM2021.

Bergman Introducing Legislation Honoring The Late Senator Tom Casperson

Washington - Today, Rep. Jack Bergman will introduce bipartisan legislation naming the Marquette Post Office after State Senator Tom Casperson. Tom served in the Michigan House and Senate for 14 years, where he passed more than 100 pieces of legislation and was a universally respected voice for the Upper Peninsula. Senator Casperson passed away on November 29, 2020 after a courageous two-year battle with lung cancer.
Rep. Jack Bergman stated, “Tom was a tireless leader for those in the Upper Peninsula – never afraid to work across the aisle and always capable of finding common ground for the betterment of the people he served. This legislation, which has already received bipartisan support from members of the Michigan Congressional delegation, is one more way we can honor his memory and help ensure his legacy lives on for many generations to come.”
Senator Casperson’s tremendous work as a lawmaker and leader for the U.P. has already been recognized by the Governor and Michigan Legislature, who recently enacted legislation dedicating the bridge on US-2 going over the Escanaba River as the “Senator Tom Casperson Memorial Bridge.”
The post office to be named the ""Senator Tom Casperson Post Office Building"" is located at 202 West Washington Street, Suite 1, in Marquette. While the post office in Senator Casperson’s hometown of Escanaba was initially considered as a candidate for naming, the facility is not owned by the USPS and its lease is currently set to expire in early 2022.

NYS COVID Rent Relief Program Accepting Applications Through February 1, 2021

The New York State Division of Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) has reopened the COVID Rent Relief Program and will be accepting new applications through Monday, February 1, 2021


NEW YORK, NY -- The New York State Division of Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) has reopened the COVID Rent Relief Program and will be accepting new applications through Monday, February 1, 2021.  The program’s eligibility criteria have been expanded to provide rent relief to more New Yorkers.  Individuals who applied during the previous application window and were denied, do not need to apply again.  Those applications are being reviewed again.  Additionally, applications from individuals who have not received a response from the HCR are being reviewed under the new criteria. 

If approved, applicants will receive a subsidy for the difference between a household’s rent burden on March 1, 2020 and the household’s rent burden in the months of April, May, June, and July 2020.  The subsidy is a one-time payment available for a maximum of four months of rent, up to 125% of the Fair Market Rents (FMR) for that household’s area.  HCR will send payments directly to the applicant’s landlord.

To qualify, applicants must meet all of the eligibility requirements:

• You must be a renter with primary residence in New York State.

• Before March 7, 2020, and at the time of application, your household income (including unemployment benefits) must have been below 80% of the area median income, adjusted for household size.  You can find your county’s area median income, based on your household size, here. 

• Households must be “rent-burdened” during the months they are applying for assistance between April 1 to July 31, 2020.  A household is rent-burdened if they are paying more than 30 percent of their income towards housing costs. 

• You must have lost income during the period of April 1, 2020 to July 31, 2020.

Detailed information about the program, including eligibility criteria, the application process, the documents that will be requested as part of the application process, and answers to frequently answered questions are available on HCR's website.  Additionally, HCR is operating a special helpline to answer questions and provide assistance with the application process.  For help, applicants can contact HCR’s COVID Rent Relief Extension Program Call Center for assistance at 1-833-499-0318 or covidrentrelief@hcr.ny.gov.  Call Center representatives are available Monday through Friday 8:30am – 5:00pm. 

If you are chosen to receive a rental subsidy through this program, New York State will cover the difference between your household's rent burden on March 1, 2020 and your household's increase in rent burden during the period your household is applying for assistance.  Households can apply for up to four months of assistance for the months of April 2020 through July 2020.  Tenants do not have to be behind in their rent to receive assistance.  Tenants who are current on their rent payments can have funds applied towards a credit for future months.  The rent subsidy payment will go directly to your landlord. 

Deadline to submit your application is Monday, February 1, 2021. 

Apply online today or visit NYS Homes and Community Renewal for more information.

Programa de Ayuda para el Alquiler por COVID del Estado de Nueva York está aceptando solicitudes hasta el 1 de febrero de 2021

La División de Renovación de Viviendas y Comunidades del Estado de Nueva York (HCR) ha reabierto el Programa de Ayuda para el Alquiler por COVID y aceptará nuevas solicitudes hasta el lunes 1 de febrero de 2021


NEW YORK, NY -- La División de Renovación de Viviendas y Comunidades del Estado de Nueva York (HCR) ha reabierto el Programa de Ayuda para el Alquiler por COVID y aceptará nuevas solicitudes hasta el lunes 1 de febrero de 2021.  Los criterios de elegibilidad del programa se han ampliado para proporcionar alivio de alquiler a más neoyorquinos.  Las personas que presentaron una solicitud durante el período de solicitud anterior y fueron denegadas, no necesitan presentar una nueva solicitud.  Estas solicitudes están siendo revisadas nuevamente.  Las solicitudes de personas que aún no han recibido una respuesta de HCR se están revisando según los nuevos criterios.

Si es aprobada, los solicitantes recibirán un subsidio por la diferencia entre la carga del alquiler del hogar el 1 de marzo de 2020 y la carga del alquiler del hogar en los meses de abril, mayo, junio y julio de 2020.  El subsidio es un pago único disponible para un máximo de cuatro meses de alquiler, hasta el 125% de los Alquileres Justos de Mercado (FMR) que se pagan en el área de esa vivienda.  HCR enviará los pagos directamente al casero del solicitante.

Para calificar, los solicitantes deben cumplir con todos los requisitos de elegibilidad:

• Debe ser un inquilino con residencia principal en el Estado de Nueva York.

• Antes del 7 de marzo de 2020 y en el momento de la solicitud, los ingresos de su hogar (incluidos los beneficios de desempleo) deben haber estado por debajo del 80% del ingreso medio del área, ajustado al tamaño del hogar. Puede encontrar el ingreso medio del área de su condado, según el tamaño de su hogar, aquí.

• Los hogares deben estar “sobrecargados por el alquiler” durante los meses en que solicitan asistencia entre el 1 de abril y el 31 de julio de 2020.  Un hogar está sobrecargado por el alquiler si paga más del 30 por ciento de sus ingresos para los costos de vivienda.

• Usted debe haber perdido ingresos durante el período del 1 de abril de 2020 al 31 de julio de 2020.

La información detallada sobre el programa, incluidos los criterios de elegibilidad, el proceso de solicitud, los documentos que se solicitarán como parte del proceso de solicitud y las respuestas a las preguntas frecuentes están disponibles en el sitio web de HCR. Además, HCR tiene en funcionamiento una línea de ayuda especial para responder preguntas y brindar asistencia con el proceso de solicitud. Para obtener ayuda, los solicitantes pueden comunicarse con el Centro de Llamadas del Programa Extendido de Ayuda para el Alquiler por COVID de HCR al 1-833-499-0318 o covidrentrelief@hcr.ny.gov.  Los representantes del Centro de Llamadas están disponibles de lunes a viernes de 8:30 am a 5:00 pm.

Si es elegido para recibir un subsidio de alquiler a través de este programa, el Estado de Nueva York cubrirá la diferencia entre la carga del alquiler de su hogar el 1 de marzo de 2020 y el aumento de la carga del alquiler de su hogar durante el período en que su hogar está solicitando asistencia. Los hogares pueden solicitar hasta cuatro meses de asistencia para los meses de abril de 2020 a julio de 2020. Los inquilinos no tienen que estar atrasados en el pago del alquiler para recibir asistencia. A los inquilinos que están al día en sus pagos de alquiler se les pueden aplicar fondos para un crédito para meses futuros. El pago del subsidio de alquiler irá directamente a su casero.

La fecha límite para enviar su solicitud es el lunes, 1 de febrero de 2021.

Solicite en línea hoy o visite NYS Homes and Community Renewal para más información.

Good Afternoon, 
 
I wanted to send you a reminder about my virtual COVID-19 vaccine and distribution Town Hall this evening, Monday, February 1st, from 6:30 -7:30 PM CT. In case you missed it, I’m re-sending my newsletter below to share the details. Registration is required. You can click here to sign up. If you can't make tonight's event, I encourage you to watch it later on my Facebook page.
 
Thank you to those who have already registered! I look forward to speaking with you.
 
Sincerely,
Congresswoman Cori Bush

Dear Lindsey,
 
I’m grateful to be in touch. As you know, since I was sworn in as your Congresswoman, a lot has happened. Together, we witnessed an insurrection at the Capitol, we voted to impeach President Trump, and we watched the swearing-in of our 46th President, Joe Biden, and Vice President, Kamala Harris, all amidst a global pandemic that has killed more than 7,000 of our neighbors here in Missouri and more than 400,000 people nationwide.
 
I want you to know that I’m working hard every day to make sure we have what we need to fight COVID-19 in our community. Right now, Missouri ranks 50th out of 50 states for vaccine rollout. This is unacceptable — and on top of this, communities in St. Louis are lagging behind in vaccine pre-registration. When Missouri fails, it's communities like ours that are impacted the most. As your Congresswoman, I am committed to doing everything I can at the federal level to ensure everyone in St. Louis gets the resources and relief they need during this pandemic and beyond.
 
I hope you will join me for my first virtual Town Hall to discuss the COVID-19 vaccine and distribution. The Town Hall will be held via Zoom on Monday, February 1, from 6:30 - 7:30 PM CT. It will also be streamed live on Facebook. A panel of experts from across the city and county will help answer your most pressing questions about the vaccine, its distribution, and will provide information on available resources. 
  
REGISTER HERE
 I want you to know that if you have questions about the COVID-19 vaccine, you are not alone. Be sure to watch my one-on-one conversation with epidemiologist and anti-racism activist Dr. Camara Phyllis Jones, where we discussed the benefits and any potential risks of the COVID-19 vaccine.
 
Please confirm your attendance in advance for the Town Hall by registering here. You may submit your questions ahead of time or ask them during the panel discussion. If you are unable to join the virtual event, you can watch the discussion live or at a later time on Facebook.
 
I also encourage you to keep in touch by subscribing to my e-newsletter, following me on Twitter or Instagram, and liking my page on Facebook.
 
I look forward to seeing you on Monday, February 1st, at 6:30 PM CT.
 
In solidarity,

Davis, Jr., Katherine Johnson, Justice Clarence Thomas, and generations of American heroes who devoted their lives to form a more perfect union.”

I cosponsored my first 20 pieces of legislation, including four pieces of legislation focused on government reform, one supporting domestic energy, and 15 pieces of pro-life legislation.   
I received my committee assignments for the 117th Congress and I am thrilled to join the Natural Resources and Veteran Affairs committees. Both of these committees will be critical in helping Montanans and the issues that impact them on a daily basis, including resources management, wildlife conservation, and, of course, providing well-deserved resources to the men and women who have bravely served our country.

I led the charge against the Biden Administration’s anti-energy policies. Before Joe Biden was even sworn in as President, I sent him a letter urging him to reverse his proposed decision to cancel the Keystone XL Pipeline and the thousands of good paying jobs it would have provided. 

I also led 26 of my House colleagues in sending a letter to President Biden requesting he reverse his recent actions banning new oil and gas permitting on public lands and waters. If the Biden Administration moves ahead with this plan, countless American jobs will be lost, upward pressure on energy prices will continue, and America’s energy dominance will disappear. 

I was an original cosponsor for the Protecting our Wealth of Energy Resources (POWER) Act which would return power back to Congress to prohibit the President or Cabinet Secretaries from issuing mineral withdrawals without congressional approval. 

I went back home to Montana and spent time with you to talk about issues you care about. I hosted a roundtable with veterans in Bozeman to figure out how I can best help veterans organizations in the area. 
.
￼
 
I also delivered remarks at the Montana Outfitters and Guide Association's winter convention and had the opportunity to catch up with some of you afterwards. 
.
￼
￼
 
I visited the US/Mexico border to learn about consequences of the Biden Administration’s dangerous, open-border policies. While there, I received briefings on the surge of illegal border crossings already happening and learned about how President Biden’s policies require more border agents to cover smaller areas of land, making it difficult to safely protect our border and track attempted crossings. An unsecure border negatively impacts our entire country -- including Montana.

￼
 I spent time with the Montana National Guard deployed to protect the Capitol building before they returned home. After some time in DC it was refreshing to be surrounded by people from back home. I was honored to express my gratitude to these Guard members for fulfilling their duty and keeping our nation’s capital safe.   
.
￼
￼
 
I was honored to attend President Biden’s inauguration and represent the great state of Montana. The inauguration is one of our most sacred institutions of the United States government, and it has been an event that has happened every four years since our constitutional government began. I will continue to hold President Biden and Vice President Harris in my thoughts and prayers as they begin to lead our nation.

￼

Hello from your Congresswoman!

￼

As we head into February, I want to provide you all with an update on the work we've done during our first month in office and the work ahead. 

With new leadership in the White House, it's clear that now is the time for us to ensure that a new stimulus package ― one centered around working people and supports for small businesses ― passes Congress immediately. While President Biden's plan is a good start, it must be the minimum floor – not the ceiling. 

This is about being not only fiscally responsible but also morally, that’s why we’ve identified five areas in which we’d like to see the package strengthened, including: 
	1.	Increasing the minimum wage to $15 
	2.	Expanding access to health care to the unemployed, uninsured, and their dependents
	3.	Increasing funding for state and local governments 
	4.	Expanding COVID-19 relief benefits to immigrants, regardless of status 
	5.	Providing recurring direct payments to the American people

￼

PRESS RELEASE
For Immediate Release
February 1, 2021


Representative Adriano Espaillat Statement Recognizing Black History Month


NEW YORK, NY – Today, Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) released the following statement in recognition of Black History Month and to announce the upcoming virtual event honoring leaders from New York’s 13th congressional district for their commitment and dedication to the African American community. 

“This month, we honor Black history and celebrate both the accomplishments and the sacrifices made by African-Americans throughout the history of our nation that have helped strengthen and shape who we are today. We take this time to remind ourselves that Black history is American history and runs deep through the fabric of this nation,” said Rep. Espaillat. 

“We honor the courageous civil rights activists who have changed the course of our history, as well as the many African-Americans who continue to push for equality today. Last month, we honored the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the commitment to his dream – we much continue to uphold and realize Dr. King’s dream today more than ever. As part of our recognition, I look forward to honoring community leaders Kevin Bracey, President of the Epsilon Sigma Chapter of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Incorporated; Reverend Ronald E. Sullivan, Pastor of the Christian Parish for Spiritual Renewal; Hazel N. Dukes, President, NAACP, New York State Conference; and C. Virginia Fields, Founder & CEO, National Black Leadership Commission on Health Inc. – during a virtual event this month.

“African-American communities were among the hardest hit during the COVID-19 pandemic – from the number of lives lost, businesses forced to closed and to the ongoing struggle to rebuild. As a nation, we simply cannot afford to leave the Black community behind and must ensure African Americans have access to the COVID-19 vaccine and other resources along our journey of recovery. Now more than ever, we must take action to fight for racial equality and renew our commitment and efforts to ensure equity and equality for all. Through our action today, we carry the torch of equality, justice, and opportunity for years to come.”

Aprovechamos este momento para recordarnos a nosotros mismos que la historia negra es la historia de Estados Unidos e impacta profundamente la estructura de esta nación”, dijo el Rep. Espaillat.

Virginia Fields, fundadora y directora ejecutiva de la Comisión Nacional de Liderazgo Afroamericano en Salud Inc., durante un evento virtual a finales de este mes.

“Las comunidades afroamericanas estuvieron entre las más afectadas durante la pandemia de COVID-19, desde la cantidad de vidas perdidas, las empresas obligadas a cerrar y las dificultades en curso para reconstruir. Como nación, simplemente no podemos permitirnos dejar atrás a la comunidad negra y debemos asegurarnos de que los afroamericanos tengan acceso a la vacuna contra el COVID-19 y otros recursos a lo largo de nuestro trayecto hacia la recuperación. Ahora más que nunca, debemos tomar medidas para luchar por la igualdad racial y renovar nuestro compromiso y esfuerzos para garantizar la equidad y la igualdad para todos. A través de nuestra acción de hoy, llevamos la antorcha de la igualdad, la justicia y las oportunidades en los años por venir"".

Newsletter Update - February 2021

Burchett receives committee assignments, holds the new administration accountable and stands up for unborn lives
￼

***NOTE: Please do not respond directly to this email. If you would like to respond to this mailing, click here to send me an email through my official website.*** 

Hello Lindsey,

I hope you are doing well and staying safe. The 117th Congress kicked off last month, and I am honored to once again serve as your congressman. One of my responsibilities in the House is to serve on policy committees, and I am pleased to share with you my committee assignments for this term.
￼

The House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee controls federal policy over road, water, air and rail transportation. I’m proud to join this committee, which gives me an influential seat at the table when it comes to fighting for East Tennessee’s transportation and infrastructure needs. Interstates 40 and 75, as well as our airports and railways, are drivers of commerce and tourism, while the Tennessee Valley Authority utilizes the powerful Tennessee River system to meet the energy needs of the Southeast. I’m excited to strengthen these important assets and explore conservative transportation policies in my new role on this committee.
￼

The House Foreign Affairs Committee works on legislation related to U.S. foreign policy, and I will once again serve on this committee. Outcomes from global events impact East Tennessee communities and our entire nation, and the House Foreign Affairs Committee has a responsibility to ensure we are pursuing non-violent solutions to conflicts around the world. I am looking forward to holding our adversaries -- like the Chinese Communist Party and the Iranian regime – responsible for their damaging actions, as well as keeping our military members out of harms way.
￼

President Joe Biden was inaugurated on Jan. 20 and urged unity during his first speech as President of the United States. So far, however, the Biden administration’s actions have failed to live up to this promise of unity. I’m disappointed by his excessive use of executive orders to unilaterally run the country rather than work with Congress in a unifying, bipartisan way on important issues. For example, executive orders that eliminate good paying oil and gas industry jobs weaken America’s energy independence, and only serve to appease the far left. President Biden must put aside divisive progressive priorities if he truly wants to unite the country. 
￼

January marked the 48th anniversary of the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision. I believe unborn babies have the right to life, and I’m standing up to the pro-abortion movement in Congress. Defending unborn lives starts with defending the Hyde Amendment, which ensures no taxpayer dollars go toward funding abortions. Sadly, some officials now want this important pro-life protection to be eliminated, so I joined 199 of my House colleagues on a letter to House leadership calling for the preservation of the Hyde Amendment. Click here to read the full letter. 
￼

Finally, I’m proud to cosponsor House Joint Resolution 12, which seeks to limit members of the House of Representatives to three two-year terms and members of the Senate to two six-year terms. Congress is controlled by a select few at the top, and term limits can help restore the power structure in our government.

It is an honor to represent you in the House of Representatives. If my office can be of assistance to you, please call my Washington, D.C. office at 202-225-5435 or my Knoxville office at 865-523-3772.

Sincerely,
￼

2/1/21 18:34,"Clyde in Congress: Committee Assignments, Border Trip, and More!","

117th Congress, 1st Session | February 1st, 2021
 


I’m pleased to inform you that I’ve been appointed by my Republican colleagues to serve on the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on Oversight and Reform for the duration of the 117th Congress. 

Having fought to defend our country both here and abroad while serving in the U.S. Navy, I am looking forward to working with my colleagues to deliver solutions to the myriad challenges that face our homeland each day, including improving border security, protecting critical infrastructure, and ensuring emergency preparedness. 

The Committee on Oversight and Reform plays a significant role in ensuring the Federal government is operating within the bounds of the U.S. Constitution, and I look forward to fighting alongside my Republican colleagues to right-size the footprint of the federal government to protect our citizens from government overreach. 

I will keep you informed on the important work both committees are expected to tackle this congress, including the Democrats’ misguided efforts to reform immigration laws. I hope you will follow along!

Trip to the Border

Last week, I visited the southern border in Arizona with several of my congressional colleagues in order to get a first-hand understanding of the challenges which exist there. Considering I had just been appointed to the Homeland Security Committee days earlier, the timing was ideal.

The best way to summarize what I learned is to say that “Walls Work. Period!”

Every Border Patrol agent I spoke to told me the Border Wall System has been a gamechanger, allowing them to spread their limited force across more territory. With the wall, one agent can control 2 miles of border where it takes 3 to 5 agents to control just one mile without the wall. The wall stops drug smugglers, illegal aliens, human traffickers and other criminals from entering our country.

Customs officers told me the border wall makes it easier to inspect what comes into the country at our ports of entry, allowing them to prevent dangerous drugs from entering our communities. In fact, I saw the evidence from a fentanyl seizure which had taken place shortly before my arrival. This one heroic action undoubtedly saved countless American lives.

Ranchers and other citizens who live near the border told me that they desperately want the border wall so that they can live safely on their land—some of which has been in their families for more than a century. Sadly, some of these remarkable people have lost loved ones to the cartel members and other criminals who crossed illegally into our country. As the border wall went up, these kinds of crimes thankfully went down. 

The sad irony of my experience is that the Biden Administration and Democrats in Congress want to see the progress we have made on the border reverted to the violent, bloody, and uncontrollable status quo which existed prior to the wall’s construction. 

On January 21st, President Biden ordered a halt to the construction of the border wall, as well as a review of the contracts issued to construct it. The results I saw from this decision were staggering. Massive gaps exist along the border where criminals can pass into our country freely. Construction crews have been forced to leave machinery, equipment, and building materials at work sites. Border agents, contractors, and citizens alike have been left wondering about what might happen next, and whether or not the situation will revert back to how it used to be. 

Sadly, I fear many of my Democratic colleagues in Congress not only support the President’s pause; they want to put an end to the wall altogether. It is obvious they have not listened to the grieving mother who lost her police officer son to a drunken illegal alien’s reckless driving. They have not heard the story of the rancher whose brother was savagely murdered by an at-large illegal alien. They have not seen the cartel scouts who watched me and my colleagues from the other side of the border, looking for weaknesses in our border operations as we toured the facilities.

If Democrats actually recognized any of these things, perhaps they would not be so keen on putting an end to one of the most important national security infrastructure projects in our country’s history. Ironically, while they do not see any value in securing our border with a wall, they have been all too happy to turn the Capitol building and its surrounding grounds into a militarized zone, complete with a metal wall topped with razor wire.

I want to be clear: if we do not secure the border in states like Arizona, the people of Georgia, and Americans across the country will suffer. The criminals, drugs, and other threats that exist on our border do not stop once they cross into our country—they will find their way into all of our communities.

As long as I am a member of Congress, you can count on me to be an advocate for a border wall so that no American has to suffer the consequences of an insecure nation.
 
 

Rep. Clyde leads the Georgia Congressional Delegation in thanking the Georgia National Guard for their service in Washington, D.C.

On January 26th, I joined my Georgia colleagues, including our two Senators, in thanking the dedicated men and women of the Georgia National Guard for their service in the national capital regions the past few weeks. These courageous citizen soldiers didn’t just excel in providing protection for the 59th Inaugural Ceremonies – ceremonies that are a hallmark of American governance and democracy – they dutifully answered the call to serve and protect with grace and were excellent ambassadors for the State of Georgia while here in Washington. 

I had the great honor to get to speak to some of these brave men and women while they were up here serving, and it was truly inspiring to hear their stories. 

You can read the full letter addressed to Major General Tom Carden below. 

Dear General Carden,

We are writing to thank you and the Georgia National Guard for the professionalism and dedication to duty your troops displayed while protecting the U.S. Capitol prior to, during, and after the recent inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Your soldiers were called upon at a moment’s notice and responded to a challenging situation with the effectiveness, tenacity, and readiness that has come to define what it means to be a Citizen Soldier.

The American people consider the military to be one of the most trustworthy institutions in our society. This is largely due to the professionalism and apolitical nature that the U.S. Armed Forces have cultivated throughout our nation’s history. The conduct your troops displayed while securing the inauguration added to that legacy. Additionally, they also served as excellent ambassadors for the State of Georgia while here in the national capital region.

As Members of Congress, we are immensely grateful for the sacrifices made by the Georgia National Guard these past two weeks. As fellow Georgians, we could not be more proud of their skill, bravery, and integrity. Accordingly, we extend our sincere thanks to each member of the Georgia National Guard for their commendable service.
 
 

Biden administration uses executive fiat to push anti-life measures in motion

As you may be aware, the White House moved to make several anti-life policy changes a reality last week. Specifically, President Biden opened the door to reversing the Trump Administration’s “Protect Life Rule,” a move that could result in taxpayer funding of programs where abortion is a method of family planning, withdrawing from the pro-life Geneva Consensus Declaration, and revoking the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance Policy (PLGHA), a policy that prohibits those countries receiving U.S. foreign aid dollars from performing or promoting abortion as a method of family planning. 

Thinking first about the PLGHA policy, I joined more than 100 of my colleagues in sending a letter to President Biden urging him to reconsider his decision on the PLGHA policy, as reversing it goes against the will of the people. Evidenced in the letter is a recent Marist poll showing that more than three in four Americans are opposed to using taxpayer funds to promote abortion programs in other countries. But unfortunately, the Biden Administration has not heeded our request. Below is the text of the full letter: 

Dear Mr. President:

As you begin your new administration pledging to foster unity and defend the truth, we respectfully ask you to reconsider your decision to discontinue the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance (PLGHA) policy. PLGHA prevents taxpayer-funded global health programs from financing foreign non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that perform, actively promote, or lobby for abortion as a method of family planning.

First established in 1984 by the Reagan Administration as the Mexico City Policy, this policy simply requires that foreign NGOs agree, as a condition of receiving federal funding, not to promote, lobby for, or perform abortion as a method of family planning. President Donald Trump reinstated and modernized this policy in 2017, applying it to all global health funds. PLGHA did not reduce the amount of federal funding available for global health and family planning programs by one cent.

PLGHA represents common ground: it allows the United States to fund global health without using taxpayer dollars to subsidize the work of groups that perform, promote or lobby for abortion. Abortion is not health care. It is never safe for the child: abortion is a brutal procedure that ends the child’s life through suction, dismemberment or chemical poisoning. In addition, the child’s mother deserves better than the tragic, irreversible consequences of elective abortion. United States foreign assistance should be life-affirming: we can support the health of both women and unborn children by providing essential obstetric care, nutritional aid and other humanitarian assistance to persons in need. 

Americans overwhelmingly oppose using U.S. foreign aid to subsidize abortion. This week a Marist Poll found more than three in four Americans—77%—oppose using tax dollars to support abortions in other countries. This number includes 64% percent of individuals who identify as pro-choice.

Many countries throughout the world have been besieged by aggressive and well-funded campaigns to overturn their pro-life laws and policies. PLGHA simply applies the commonsense view that the U.S. taxpayer should not be put in the position of funding foreign NGOs that perform or actively promote abortion, while respecting the national sovereignty of other nations.

As the world continues to confront the deadly COVID-19 pandemic and its social and economic consequences, United States foreign assistance should be used for life-affirming health care rather than the promotion of the abortion industry. We respectfully ask you to reinstate the PLGHA policy. 

At a time when many of our leaders are pushing anti-life agendas, it is more important than ever that we stand strong to defend the innocent unborn and ensure our laws do too. That is why I also added my name to the following pro-life measures last week:
﻿
	•	The “Born-Alive Abortion Survivor Protection Act,” a bill to require adequate medical care and hospital admittance for any child who survives an abortion attempt. 
	•	The “Defund Planned Parenthood Act” a bill to block funding for one year to Planned Parenthood and its affiliates and to redistribute those funds to women’s health care facilities that practice life-affirming medical care. 
	•	The “Day of Tears Resolution” to memorialize the children we have lost to abortions by lowering flags to half-staff on January 22nd each year, the anniversary of the Roe v. Wade decision.  
 

In the District: Rep. Clyde visits local company and the University of North Georgia during the district work week
 

Last week, I had the privilege to tour three of Kubota Manufacturing’s campuses in the district. I was impressed by the scale and efficiency of their operation as a critical piece of our equipment supply chain. Watching lawnmowers and ATVs roll off the line as employees work simply illustrates how manufacturers have adapted during this pandemic to keep their employees safe, while simultaneously continuing operations. We discussed their ability to purchase raw materials, and hire employees, and the after-market impacts on their goods. I thank them for inviting me to tour their facility, and I look forward to following their successes. 
 

I also had the opportunity to tour the University of North Georgia in Dahlonega. I had a very productive meeting with President Jacobs, learned about the university, and was briefed on how it has overcome numerous challenges during the pandemic to ensure its students can continue their studies. While on campus, I also had the pleasure of meeting with the Corps of Cadets—who were recently ranked #1 in the nation. I look forward to supporting the Corps as they work to fill America’s military with high-quality junior officers. 
 

Members of the House return to Washington this week
 

I return to Washington, D.C. this week where you can expect the House to come back into session on Tuesday. We are expected to consider a budget resolution that will make it easier for the Democrats to push President Biden’s staggering $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief priorities through both the House and Senate by curtailing certain rules and procedures. While it is too early to determine whether the Democrats will attempt the entire relief package at once or do it in chunks, we know these relief efforts only stand to increase our already inflated deficit spending and are nothing more than a wolf in a sheep’s clothing for advancing the left’s radical agenda through Congress while certain procedural and budgetary rules are suspended. 

In addition, you can expect the House to consider the “National Apprenticeship Act,” a bill marketed by the Democrats as an effort to improve apprenticeship programs. Unfortunately, the bill does nothing more than add more bureaucratic red tape that limits employers’ abilities to create an apprenticeship program that meets their unique workforce development challenges and needs. As a small business owner, I know how important it is to invest in both your employees and your workforce pipeline. Unfortunately, this bill limits apprenticeship opportunities for industries that rely on them most, and so you can expect me to oppose this bill. 

As always, you can follow my efforts throughout the week by following me on Facebook (Congressman Andrew Clyde) and Instagram (@repclyde).

2/1/21 18:42,Newsletter: First Month in Congress,"
 

Dear friends,
﻿
The first weeks of this Congress have been historic. Despite the abhorrent and disgusting violence seen on Capitol Hill at the hands of domestic terrorists, our nation witnessed a peaceful transition of power – a hallmark of our democracy. The continuity of this important event highlighted that we will not allow domestic terrorists to stop us from conducting our work on behalf of the American people. I came to Congress to work past the political divides and work to deliver results for Florida’s 26th congressional district. 
 

I remain hopeful that the days and months ahead will showcase the exceptionalism of the American people, putting aside our differences for the strengthening of our democracy. When America is united, our nation is truly the shining light of the world.

I look forward to the work all of us will do together to improve our communities, our state, and our nation. Thank you for your trust and confidence. It is my highest honor to represent the greatest district and the finest people in America.
 
Sincerely,
 

Carlos A. Gimenez
Member of Congress
 

Gimenez Urges Constituents to Re-Open Casework

Congressman Carlos Gimenez’s staff is ready to serve the constituents of Florida’s 26th congressional district. If you had a pending case with the previous representative’s office, Gimenez’s office urges you to contact them. 

The previous representative, ex-Congresswoman Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, did not transfer any of the information over to Gimenez’s office during the transition, and so new cases must be opened.

Gimenez Receives Committee Assignments

Congressman Gimenez has been appointed to the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee (T&I), one of the largest and most influential committees in the House of Representatives. He was also selected to serve on the Homeland Security Committee (CHS) and the Science, Space, and Technology Committee (SST). 
 
The T&I Committee, which Gimenez has stated was a priority for him to land a position on the committee, handles issues critical to South Florida. The committee has oversight of aviation and maritime transportation, as well as the maintenance of modes of transportation, such was roadways and bridges. Click here to view Gimenez’s full statement on his appointment to T&I. 
 
CHS, which Gimenez also publicly courted, was the second committee assigned to Gimenez in the week. Gimenez said he will continue to advocate for policies that help fortify security at major ports of entry into the United States saying it is paramount to ensuring America’s national security. The committee has jurisdiction over federal agencies pertaining to domestic security, including authorization of, and legislation related to, the Department of Homeland Security. Click here to view Gimenez’s full statement on his appointment to CHS. 
 
SST was the final committee assigned to Gimenez this week. Gimenez said he will use his experience in making Miami-Dade County an attractive hub for tech entrepreneurs and start up companies to push policies forward at the federal level that expand research and development.

Honoring our Law Enforcement: the Florida National Guard and the Capitol Police
 

Last week, Congressman Gimenez was joined by two of his Florida delegation colleagues, Congresswoman Kat Cammack and Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart, to the Washington Monument where they visited with members of the Florida National Guard. Some 600 servicemembers were deployed last week from Florida to Washington, D.C. to support security efforts around Capitol grounds before, during, and beyond President Biden’s inauguration.

Gimenez thanked the servicemembers from their heroic duties, reminding them that the reason the United States continues to be a bastion of freedom and democracy – and an example to the world – is because of their service. “You are called upon to safeguard our nation, here and abroad. You defend the freedoms we all enjoy,” Gimenez told the servicemembers.
 

Following the vote series, Congressman Gimenez and his Washington, D.C. staff delivered a ‘thank you’ poster for Capitol Police inside the tunnel connecting the Cannon and Longworth House Office Buildings to the Capitol. “The frontline men and women of the US Capitol Police protect our Capitol every day with grace and incredible diligence,” Gimenez said in a tweet. 

Gimenez and Colleagues Call for Bipartisan Engagement with Biden Administration

Congressman Carlos Gimenez joined 16 of his freshman Republican colleagues on a letter to President Biden signaling their intent to work with the new administration. 

Regarding the letter, Gimenez stressed the importance of bipartisan engagement in order to move past the political divides and get done the work that will help South Florida communities. “Moving forward we must work together to deliver results for [Florida’s 26th congressional district] and our nation,” Gimenez tweeted on Wednesday. 
 

The letter, which was sent to President Biden moments before his official inauguration as President of the United States, said it was time for Republicans and Democrats to work together on the issues that matter most to Americans and points to strengthening the economy amid the COVID-19 pandemic and protecting Americans with pre-existing conditions – all policies that will likely dominate President Biden’s first 100 days.

""After two impeachments, lengthy inter-branch investigations, and most recently, the horrific attack on our nation's capital, it is clear that the partisan divide between Democrats and Republicans does not serve a single American,"" the letter signed by Gimenez states.

Call for Free and Fair Markets: Gimenez Joins Bipartisan Demands for Investigations into Robinhood and Other Financial Institutions

On Thursday evening, Congressman Carlos Gimenez joined a bipartisan group of colleagues demanding an investigation by the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) into market manipulations by major financial trade institutions such as Robinhood. 
 

The letter, which was signed by 12 members – including Gimenez – raises concerns that these institutions are changing market trading rules in favor of large hedge funds and wealthy investment brokers at the expense of market access to individual investors. 
 
The calls for an investigation come after stock brokerages temporarily restricted trading on GameStop, AMC Theaters, and Blackberry shares. Throughout the last week, users of the popular online forum Reddit spurred countless individuals to buy stocks in the companies, send previously undesirable stocks through the roof — causing massive losses by brokerages and institutional investors. 
 
In response, TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab also joined Robinhood in restricting users of their platforms from trades.
 
Gimenez and his colleagues view the move from these stock brokerage firms as deliberate attempts to manipulate the market to protect large investors, namely the hedge funds losing money. “Wall Street should not have one set of rules for large institutional investors and another for individuals. Make the market free and fair,” Gimenez said in a tweet announcing his signature of the letter. 

Legislative Update: Congressman Gimenez’s Latest Actions

Since the beginning of Congress, Congressman Gimenez has co-sponsored the following legislation:
1)   H.R. 305: The Officer Eugene Goodman Congressional Gold Medal Act 
 
In recognition of U.S. Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman’s heroic acts during the violent Capitol Hill riot on January 6, where 2 police officers lost their lives, this bill officially nominates him for the Congressional Gold Medal.
 
2)   H.R. 287: The FORCE Act 
 
This bill makes permanent the listing of the communist regime in Cuba on the Department of Defense’s State Sponsor of Terrorism list until Cuba fulfills a series of pro-democratic and pro-free market requirements.

2/1/21 20:25,Path Forward on Bipartisan COVID Relief,"A message from US Senator Todd Young
￼ 


Path Forward on Bipartisan COVID Relief
Tonight, I was part of a group of 10 Republican Senators who met with President Biden to discuss the details of a more targeted COVID-19 relief proposal capable of garnering bipartisan support. My colleagues and I recognize the President’s calls for unity and want to work in good faith with his administration to meet the health, economic, and societal challenges of the COVID crisis. Our plan mirrors many of the components from his plan, including increasing funding for the production and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine; providing economic relief for Americans with the greatest need; extending enhanced federal unemployment benefits; providing nutrition assistance to help struggling families; providing additional assistance for our small businesses; getting our children safely back to school and ensuring they can stay open; and increasing resources for child care, which is critical to getting Americans back to work.  Yesterday, I sent a letter to President Biden, with Senators Susan Collins (R-Maine), Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Mitt Romney (R-Utah), Rob Portman (R-Ohio), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.), Jerry Moran (R-Kan.), Mike Rounds (R-S.D.), and Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) outlining our COVID-19 relief compromise.  Since March 2019, Congress has passed five bipartisan Covid-19 relief bills and provided more than $4 trillion in COVID-19 relief. The latest COVID-19 relief package provided $900 billion in additional resources and was signed into law on December 27, 2020. Much of that assistance is only now being disbursed.  Click here for more details on the proposal.  
February is Black History Month
February is Black History Month. This month, and throughout the year, we reflect on centuries of Black history and heritage in communities across Indiana and the country. Over the past three years in the Senate, and throughout my tenure as an elected official, I have made it a priority to meet with Indiana’s Black leaders and hear firsthand what changes needs to occur. As such, I have been working closely with these groups to enact real reforms within criminal justice, affordable housing, health care, job opportunities, and education.   While Black History Month is often synonymous with prominent figures such as Martin Luther King Jr., Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks, and more, this February, I ask that all Hoosiers recognize and celebrate the contributions of all our Black communities and how their efforts have helped make Indiana the great state it is today.
Supporting the Pro-Life Agenda and March for Life 
Year after year, Hoosiers remain united behind our most fundamental right - the right to life. Even though this year’s March for Life was virtual, it was just as important that we stand up for the unborn, especially now that the Biden Administration has already taken steps to allow taxpayer-funded abortions on demand. I will continue to support legislation that protects innocent life.  President Biden’s reversal of abortion restrictions goes against the pro-life principles supported by a majority of Americans and certainly by most Hoosiers. I am sickened that making abortions easier to obtain was one of the President’s top priorities upon taking office.  As a Senator, President Biden supported the Hyde Amendment, which bans federal funding for abortions. However, now that he has risen to the White House, it’s clear he is taking orders from the radical left who support taxpayer-funded abortions on demand. I will continue fighting back against these horrific actions and doing everything in my power to protect the unborn.
Click here to learn more about my efforts to defend life through:  
The No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act 
	•	The bill would prohibit the use of federal funds for abortions or for health care coverage that includes abortions.
The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act 
	•	The bill would protect unborn babies after 20 weeks post-fertilization, a point at which research has shown unborn children feel pain. The United States is currently one of only seven countries in the world that allow abortions after 20 weeks – a list which includes human rights violators like China and North Korea.
The Support and Value Expectant (SAVE) Moms and Babies Act 
	•	The bill would strengthen the oversight of chemical abortion drugs, prevent providers from dispensing them remotely, and stop the approval of new types of these drugs.
The Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act 
	•	The bill would ensure that babies who survive an attempted abortion have a chance at life by requiring health care practitioners to provide the same level of treatment for these babies as they would for any other baby born at the same age. 
The Dignity for Aborted Children Act 
	•	The bill would ensure the bodies of the unborn are treated with respect by enforcing guidelines for the dignified handling of aborted fetal remains. 
The Protecting Life in Foreign Assistance Act 
	•	The bill would codify the expanded Mexico City Policy in law, ensuring no U.S. foreign aid be provided to organizations that provide or promote abortions.  
The Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act 
	•	The bill would prohibit elective abortion providers, such as Planned Parenthood, from receiving federal grants through the Title X Family Planning Program.
The Defund Planned Parenthood Act 
	•	The bill would prohibit federal funding for Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest abortion provider.
New START Extension to Limit Russia’s Strategic Arsenal  
Over the last 10 years, the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty has advanced our national security and effectively constrained Russia’s strategic nuclear arsenal. Extending New START is clearly in our nation’s best interest, and that’s why I am pleased to hear the Biden Administration is working to renew the Treaty with Russia for five years. I hope both sides are able to swiftly come to an agreement to preserve this important arms control accord.  New START keeps a lid on Russia’s long-range nuclear capabilities that target the U.S. homeland and includes an extensive monitoring regime that provides us valuable insight into the operations, composition, and location of Russia’s nuclear forces. Critically, extending New START will also lay the groundwork for negotiating follow-on agreements with Russia and pursuing parallel efforts to engage China on arms control.  Looking beyond New START, I look forward to working with the new Administration to continue enhancing other aspects of our nuclear deterrence, including the bipartisan work to modernize the United States’ nuclear arsenal, and craft an effective, durable arms control strategy that enhances our national security. 
Constitutional Amendment To Keep SCOTUS At Nine Justices 
Last week, I joined my colleagues in reintroducing a constitutional amendment that would limit the Supreme Court of the United States to nine justices. The Supreme Court has had nine seats since 1869.  The Supreme Court is critical to our system of checks and balances, and proposals that call for expanding the Court to further partisan goals are antithetical to American values. Such efforts would irreparably harm our democracy and Americans’ faith in our institutions. I hope the new administration will support this effort to reaffirm our commitment to the norms that have served us well for the past 150 years.
National School Choice Week Resolution
I introduced a resolution declaring last week as National School Choice Week. In a time when COVID-19 has severely limited access to quality education for many, parents across the country continue to recognize the importance of school choice. According to a new survey released by the American Federation for Children, 72 percent of K-12 parents who work full-time support school choice.  The education of our youth is a priority for all Hoosiers. Families should be allowed to choose the type of education that best suits their children’s needs. I’m proud to support National School Choice Week as we recognize and celebrate all kinds of learning opportunities for Hoosiers, especially during this pandemic.
Gateway to Careers Act to Expand Job Opportunities and Strengthen Innovative Businesses
Every Hoosier deserves a fair shot at success. My Gateway to Careers Act would help remove barriers that keep individuals from excelling in our ever-changing workforce. This bill would provide resources to individuals in need to help train our workers, support our businesses, and grow our economy – which is especially relevant during this pandemic.  Learn more about this bill here.  
The Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act
Each day, the world becomes more aware of the horrific human rights abuses being committed by the Chinese Communist Party against the Uyghur people in Xinjiang, China. Governments and industries alike need to speak up for those being oppressed and enslaved in these modern-day concentration camps. It is unconscionable that western companies would benefit from modern day slavery. These human rights atrocities must stop and I am glad to work with my bipartisan colleagues to help bring an end to these abuses.  Which is why, last week, I helped reintroduce the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. This bipartisan bill will ensure that goods made with Uyghur forced labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) do not enter the United States. Earlier this year, the State Department issued a determination that the Chinese Communist Party is committing crimes against humanity and genocide against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang.

2/1/21 20:32,District Update: Fighting for Arkansas Workers,"District Update | February 1, 2021
View Email in Browser 
￼ 
Dear Friends,
In his first days in office, President Biden has already let his promises to American workers fall by the wayside in favor of a far-left wish list. 
The Biden Administration’s decision to terminate the Keystone XL Pipeline will cost the United States thousands of high-paying American jobs and raise energy prices for American families. Similarly, policies like re-entering the Paris Climate Accord provide no accountability for polluters like China and unfairly punishes U.S. manufacturers. These actions undermine U.S. energy independence and place an undue burden on our industries during a period of economic uncertainty.
On Friday, I held a press conference at Welspun’s headquarters in Little Rock with local businesses and workers who have been harmed by President Joe Biden’s Executive Order halting the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. In addition to placing Welspun workers at risk, this decision hurts those selling steel coils, loading and unloading barges on the Arkansas River and on the Port of Little Rock short-line rail, plus many other supplies.  
As your representative in Congress, I am fighting to protect the jobs of hard-working Arkansans. 
￼


HONORING AN AMERICAN HERO
On Tuesday, I was honored to present U.S. Air Force Master Sergeant (Ret.) Robert Davis with two medals for his service during the Vietnam War. 
MSgt. Davis retired in 1975 but never received the proper commendation for his service in Vietnam. MSgt. Davis contacted my office in May of 2020, and on December 29, 2020, the United States Air Force determined that MSgt. Davis was deserving of the Vietnam Service Medal and the Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross.
Although it was a nearly 50-year wait, I was proud to recognize MSgt. Davis for his brave service to our country. I'm grateful to my Veterans Team for working diligently over six months to ensure MSgt. Davis received the awards he deserved. 
Read more about the ceremony and MSgt. Davis HERE.

CLAIMING ECONOMIC IMPACT PAYMENTS FOR DEPENDENTS UNDER 17
The COVID-19 relief bill passed in December 2020 included $600 Economic Impact Payments for dependents under 17 years of age. Friday, January 15th, was the deadline to receive both your EIP and any EIP for each qualifying dependent via direct deposit. Dependents 17 years of age and older do not qualify for EIPs. This includes college students and other adult dependents. 
Please note that it may take several weeks for you to receive payments in the form of a paper check or an EIP pre-paid debit card.  
If you have not received Economic Impact Payments for yourself or your qualifying dependents, you can claim a Recovery Rebate Credit on your 2020 taxes. I encourage Arkansans to file their taxes as soon as possible. As per the IRS, even if you usually don’t file taxes, it is the only way to claim your first or second EIP, as well as EIPs for qualifying dependents. 
For more information on the Economic Impact Payments and the Recovery Rebate Credit, please visit the IRS website HERE. 
If you have questions, please contact me at (501) 324-5941 or Hill.House.Gov. 

ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS
Hearing from Arkansans about the issues important to them is a critical part of my job. Last week, I hosted a conference call to take your questions and discuss your concerns about the issues facing you and your family. 
We discussed the COVID-19 vaccine, policies proposed and enacted by the new administration, election integrity, and other issues important to central Arkansas.

GETTING YOUR COVID-19 VACCINE
On Thursday, I met with Col. (Ret.) Robert Ator, who was appointed by Governor Hutchinson to oversee the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine in Arkansas.
The federal government has increased the supply of vaccines available to Arkansans by 16%. More than 400,000 doses have been sent to Arkansas. The increase in doses available and their distribution efficiency will help fill the gaps we have seen across counties.
I am thankful for Col. Ator's leadership and his efforts to implement a consistent and efficient strategy to distribute Arkansas's supply of COVID-19 vaccines.
The following hospitals in central Arkansas are administering the COVID-19 to those in phases 1-A and 1-B:
	•	Baptist Health
	•	UAMS
	•	CHI St. Vincent
	•	Unity Health 
	•	Conway Regional 
Vaccines are also available at local pharmacies. CLICK HERE to find a pharmacy location near you.

UPHOLDING THE CONSTITUTIONAL ROLE OF CONGRESS
President Biden has begun his term with a slew of executive actions, more than 40 and counting. Governing by executive order is not the right way for the president to begin his first 100 days. Governing by executive action undermines the important constitutional role the Founders granted to Congress and President Biden’s pledge for unity and consensus in Washington. Going forward, I hope that President Biden will instead work with Congress on a bipartisan basis.  My full op-ed in the Log Cabin Democrat. 
￼


CALLING OUT GOVERNMENT OVERREACH 
At the start of the pandemic, hand sanitizer and PPE were in short supply. Seeing a need to help their communities, America’s distilleries stepped up to produce hand sanitizer at little to no profit for frontline workers and families. 
However, in the week between Christmas and the New Year, and after a painful financial year for many of these distilleries, they received a surprise notification that they now owed the FDA more than $14,000 for their willingness to step in and help their fellow Americans.
For their overreach and the poor timing of this announcement, I gave the FDA my Golden Fleece Award. While I am glad the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) overrode the FDA's decision to enforce these fees, this should not have happened in the first place. 
The federal government shouldn’t stand in the way of small businesses that step up to help their communities in times of national crisis. 
￼


HELPING ARKANSAS VETERANS  
On Tuesday, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced the approval of the Central Arkansas Veterans Health Care System as one of only 12 new Fisher House program priority sites to keep veterans and their loved ones together during medical care. Fisher Houses provide short-term, no-cost housing to families and caregivers of hospitalized active-duty or retired military members and veterans who do not live within commuting distance of a hospital.
This funding was long overdue and is welcome news to central Arkansas veterans and their families. Along with my Veterans Team, I have been advocating for a Fisher House in central Arkansas since my first year in Congress. The men and women who serve our country in uniform deserve top-notch medical care with the peace of mind and comfort of having their families close by during their recovery and rehabilitation processes.
Sincerely,
￼ 
Representative French Hill

Kansas Common Sense  February 1, 2021
Hello,  Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them. 
  
Announcing a Targeted Federal Relief Proposal to Rein in President Biden’s $1.9 Trillion Plan 
This weekend, I joined nine of my Republican colleagues to unveil a targeted COVID-19 federal relief proposal, built on a foundation of bipartisan ideas, to rein in Biden’s $1.9 trillion plan. I met with President Biden today at the White House to discuss the Republican proposal and encourage the President to support a targeted, less expensive plan, and to get it done quickly to benefit Americans.  Last year, Congress spent $4 trillion on bipartisan COVID-19 relief packages to support Americans as our country faced the challenges of this pandemic. While more can be done to accelerate vaccine distribution and protect small businesses, the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion plan filled with unrelated, partisan wish list items is not the right path forward.  We must focus on vaccines – it’s the most important thing we can do. More shots in more arms is the best thing that can happen for our country’s well-being, both from a health perspective and for our economy. I also want to make certain we get kids back in the classroom, that small businesses get assistance, and that Americans who need the most help get relief.  President Biden has pledged a spirit of unity, and I hope he will rise to that promise by working with both sides of the aisle in Congress to pass a bipartisan relief package to meet the ongoing challenges of this crisis.  Before the meeting with President Biden, I joined Fox News from the White House to discuss the meeting and the Republican COVID-19 relief proposal.

Happy 160th Birthday, Kansas! 
Friday was Kansas’s 160th birthday. On January 29, 1861, Kansas became the 34th state admitted to the Union. As we enter our 160th year, I want to wish a happy Kansas Day to our great state. The people and natural beauty of Kansas make it a place I’m proud and grateful to call home. Ad astra per aspera!

Securing Workforce Certainty for Kansas Agriculture 
Each year, thousands of guest workers travel from South Africa to work for Kansas farmers, ag co-ops and custom harvesters. These workers are essential to America’s food security, helping to plant, harvest and process our nation’s crops. After hearing from the Kansas agriculture community about the impact President Biden’s executive order restricting travel from South Africa would have on our agricultural workforce, I spoke with State Department officials on Tuesday about making certain these H-2A workers could travel while still ensuring strict COVID-19 safety protocols. The State Department followed up on my call to clarify that agricultural workers from South Africa will receive a national interest exemption. This is positive news for Kansas producers who continue to work to feed a hungry world. 
  
Improving Vaccine Distribution and Communication 
Discussing COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout with The University of Kansas Health Systems 
On Wednesday morning, I joined The University of Kansas Health System (TUKHS) for their daily media update to discuss the COVID-19 vaccine and vaccine distribution across the state. I also discussed how I am calling on the White House to double their stated goal of 100 million doses in 100 days. I was joined by TUKHS Medical Director for Infection Prevention and Control Dr. Dana Hawkinson, TUKHS Chief Medical Officer Dr. Steve Stites and national member of the Coronavirus Commission for Safety and Quality in Nursing Homes Dr. Jessica Kalender-Rich for the media update.  The COVID-19 vaccine is our best shot at getting Kansas back to normal. Our discussion emphasized the importance of improved vaccine distribution and the need to get as many shots into as many arms as possible over the next months. We need greater transparency on the numbers of vaccines being produced and what we can expect in the future from the federal government. We also need improved transparency at the state level on where the vaccine is being shipped, who has been vaccinated and where future shipments will be sent so that our counties and health care providers can better prepare for the next few months.  Following my conversations with health care providers and county officials, I have been working to create an open dialogue between our counties, the state and the federal government to facilitate clear communication around vaccines. This extends to our hospitals in Kansas, who have grown frustrated at the lack of an explained and extended plan regarding vaccine distribution and administration throughout the coming months. I will continue to work to make certain all Kansans, both rural and urban, have access to the COVID-19 vaccine during the coming months. 
  
Visiting the Ambulatory Infusion Clinic in Wichita 
On Friday, I visited Ascension Via Christi St. Joseph Campus in Wichita. I was pleased to spend Kansas Day learning how I can be of greater help to hospitals like Ascension Via Christi. I learned about their COVID-19 treatment options, as well as the vaccination process that is underway to ensure that both health care workers, and now the general public, can be vaccinated.  In addition to their vaccination program, Ascension Via Christi also provides an antibody infusion. The infusion, called Bamlanivimab or BAM, received the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) emergency use authorization and is used to ease the severity of a COVID-19 patient’s symptoms in the hopes of preventing hospitalization. I was impressed by the skilled work of the health care professionals at the clinic, especially as they maneuver the challenges of caring for positive COVID-19 patients.

Update on Impeachment 
On Tuesday, senators were sworn in to begin the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump. One of the first acts was a vote on a motion to dismiss the trial. Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer introduced a motion to table Senator Rand Paul’s amendment that ruled on the constitutionality of impeaching a former president not currently in office. Senator Schumer’s motion prevailed 55-45 and the Senate will hear the impeachment charges on February 9.  The Constitution is where I go to find answers. Unfortunately, the Constitution does not clearly answer whether a former president can be impeached. This decision will set precedent for future Congresses in regards to impeachment, and I am clearly on the side that a former president should not be subject to impeachment. Giving the green light that future Congresses can impeach a former president would cause extreme damage to our country and the future of the presidency. 
  
Protecting Life and Defending the Unborn 
Friday marked the 48th National March for Life, an annual event that, under normal circumstances, brings communities from across the country, including hundreds from Kansas, to march peacefully in protest of a decision that has enabled the elimination of more than 60 million children. For the first time since Roe v. Wade was announced in 1973, these individuals were not able to come to Washington due to the ongoing pandemic; instead, they voiced their support through a series of virtual events to continue their stand to defend America’s most vulnerable. While I missed the ability to meet with Kansans outside the U.S. Capitol this year, I want to thank each of you who participated in the virtual March for Life to stand for the unborn.  Throughout the week, I continued to use my role in Congress to further the cause of life and defend the unborn by introducing multiple pieces of legislation to prevent federal dollars from funding abortions, provide commonsense protections for unborn children, protect expectant mothers and their babies from dangerous abortion drugs and make certain newborns that survive abortions receive medical care.

Questioning the Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough 
On Wednesday, the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee considered the nomination of Denis McDonough to be the next Secretary of Veterans Affairs. I met with Mr. McDonough earlier this month and stressed how important it is for the next VA Secretary to be ready on day one to deliver the benefits and services our veterans have earned. Over the last four years, VA has made significant improvements in both veteran and employee satisfaction. VA has also begun to implement reforms passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump: expanded health care access and caregiver support under the MISSION Act, faster processing of appeals under the Appeals Modernization Act and expanded educational and training benefits for servicemembers, veterans and their families under the Forever GI Bill. In our conversation and in my questioning of the nominee, I made it clear that VA must faithfully implement these laws and work with Congress to see to it that veterans benefit from these reforms as intended. 
  
Stressing the Importance of Kansas Agriculture with Nominee Tom Vilsack 
This week, I met virtually with Tom Vilsack, nominee for Secretary of Agriculture. During our meeting, I highlighted issues important to Kansas farmers, ranchers and rural communities. In 2015, when Secretary Vilsack previously served in this role, he attended the groundbreaking ceremony of the National Bio Agro-defense Facility (NBAF) in Manhattan. During our conversation, I invited him to join me again in Kansas to see the tremendous progress being made in constructing NBAF and to receive an update on the central role USDA will play in operating the facility once construction is completed. I look forward to Secretary Vilsack’s visit to our state.  During our discussion, I also raised issues of immediate consequence to Kansas farmers and ranchers, most importantly, climate change and environmental regulation, as well as our shared commitment to addressing global hunger and ways we can work together to push policies that reduce food insecurity.  I look forward to working with Secretary Vilsack in the future to best serve Kansas’ farmers, ranchers and agricultural producers.  Listen to my interview with the Kansas Ag Network (WIBW) discussing my meeting with Vilsack here. 
  
￼ 
  
Questioning Secretary of Commerce Nominee Gina Raimondo 
This week, I questioned Governor Gina Raimondo, the nominee to be the Secretary of Commerce, about the recapitalization of aging Department of Commerce infrastructure and the potential imposition of tariffs on imported phosphate fertilizer. Phosphate fertilizers are critical for farmers to grow crops, as phosphorous accounts for approximately 20 percent of fertilizer usage in the United States. Governor Raimondo committed to working with me and Secretary of Agriculture Nominee Tom Vilsack regarding export and import policies for farmers. I remain committed to ensuring that the government is not making it more difficult for Kansans to make a living in the agricultural sector. 
  
￼ 
 
I also spoke with Governor Raimondo the day before the hearing about the Privacy Shield agreement between the U.S. and the E.U. and about data privacy. Last year, I introduced the Consumer Data Privacy and Security Act, a bill that would strengthen the laws that govern consumers’ personal data and create clear standards and regulations for American businesses that collect, process and use consumers’ personally identifiable data. This legislation would complement the Department of Commerce’s ongoing efforts to negotiate a new Privacy Shield agreement, which small and medium sized businesses in Kansas utilized for transatlantic commerce but was invalidated by a European court last year. As the lead Republican on the Commerce, Justice, and Science Senate Appropriations Subcommittee, and lead Republican on the Manufacturing, Trade, and Consumer Protection Commerce Subcommittee, if she is confirmed, I will work with Governor Raimondo to ensure the priorities of Kansans are the priorities of the Department of Commerce.

Urging President Biden to Retain Trump Administration WOTUS Rule 
I joined my Senate colleagues in introducing a resolution this week to express support for the Navigable Waters Protection Rule—the Trump administration’s replacement for the Obama-era Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule.  In 2015, the Obama administration finalized a rule that expanded the definition of the WOTUS, creating confusion and burdensome red tape for the agriculture community and many others. The Trump administration replaced the 2015 WOTUS rule with the Navigable Waters Protection Rule. This new rule provided much-needed predictability and certainty for farmers by establishing clear and reasonable definitions of what qualifies as a “water of the United States.” The Navigable Waters Protection Rule was finalized last year.  This week, President Biden signed an executive order that would roll back the Trump administration’s executive order which originally began the process of rescinding Obama’s WOTUS rule. Repealing the Trump administration’s Navigable Waters Protection Rule will reinstate burdensome regulations on Kansas farmers, ranchers and small businesses. This commonsense rule promotes clean water for our communities and families, while respecting private property rights and providing certainty for landowners. We’ve already seen the damage and confusion caused by the Obama-era WOTUS rule, and returning to that standard is unacceptable. 
  
Biden’s “Made in America” Agenda Must Prioritize American Farmers and Ranchers 
Kansans take pride in our farmers and ranchers feeding a hungry world. Since the enactment of the Food for Peace Act under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, America has reached more than 4 billion hungry and starving people in the world and in America, saving countless lives. This week, I wrote an op-ed urging President Biden to recognize the vital role farmers and ranchers play in U.S. international food aid programs in the administration’s “Made in America” agenda. The Obama administration proposed a massive overhaul of U.S. international food aid that would have damaged programs that provide U.S.-grown commodities to food insecure people around the world, including by sending cash assistance to food insecure nations instead of food and commodities grown in Kansas. The Biden administration should not return to these failed proposals. Instead, I asked the President to submit a budget to Congress that calls for robust funding for international food aid programs that utilize U.S.-grown commodities and rejects efforts to diminish the role of our nation’s farmers and ranchers in the programs.  Read my full editorial in Agri-Pulse here. 
  
Protecting Veterans from Ongoing COVID-19 Unemployment 
This week, I introduced the Veterans Economic Recovery Act, legislation to provide unemployed veterans access to rapid retraining programs so they can re-enter the workforce. In 2019, thanks to the many reforms enacted by Congress, we saw the lowest unemployment rate in 20 years. Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the unemployment rate for veterans spiked into the double digits in the early surge of the pandemic, and the veteran unemployment rates continue to be higher than the historic lows we experienced previously. As the pandemic continues, meaningful employment is key to the well-being of our country’s veterans and their families, and this legislation is one more tool to ensure veterans receive the retraining opportunities they have earned. This legislation will provide needed resources and benefits to our Kansas veterans and the men and women across the country who have raised their right hand to serve our nation. As ranking member, I look forward to working with Chairman Jon Tester (D-Mon.) and my colleagues on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee to advance this legislation as soon as possible. 
  
Announcing U.S. Olympics and Paralympics Commission Members, Including Kansan Robert Cohen 
This week, I was pleased to announce that four individuals have been selected to serve on the Commission on the State of U.S. Olympics and Paralympics. The four members of the Commission are Kansas native and Denver Sports Founder Robert Cohen, former Olympic athletes John Dane and Brittney Reese, and U.S. Olympic Endowment Chairman William Hybl. Established by my sweeping Olympic reform legislation, the Empowering Olympic, Paralympic, and Amateur Athletes Act, which was signed into law by President Trump last October, this commission is tasked with reviewing the operations and performance of the United State Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC). I am grateful to these four individuals for their willingness to serve on the commission. 
  
Preventing Chinese Goods Made by Forced Labor from Entering the U.S. 
This week, I sponsored the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act, which will ensure products made with Uyghur forced labor in Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region do not enter the United States. I have repeatedly condemned the abuses carried out by the Chinese government, and last summer, I called China’s treatment of Uyghurs a genocide. The State Department recently affirmed my belief by determining that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is committing crimes against humanity and genocide against Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in Xinjiang. The United States cannot ignore what is happening nor in any way enable the continued abuse of the Uyghurs. By preventing goods made by forced labor and abuse of the Uyghurs from ending up on American soil, this bipartisan legislation will make certain the CCP does not profit from slave labor. 
  
Visiting with the Topeka Chamber at the Congressional Forum Breakfast 
I spoke with the Topeka Chamber at their Congressional Forum Breakfast this weekend, where we discussed the COVID-19 vaccine response, including increasing the efforts at all levels to distributing the vaccine into as many arms as possible. During our discussion, I emphasized the importance of getting kids that have been learning remotely back into school, so that parents are able to go to work. We also talking about the Payment Protection Program (PPP) program and how it must continue to support business throughout this pandemic.  Thank you to Curtis Sneden and to all Chamber members who attended both virtually and in-person. 
  
￼
  
Awarding U.S. Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman the Congressional Gold Medal 
This week, I cosponsored legislation to award United States Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman with the Congressional Gold Medal to honor his actions during the violence and destruction that befell the U.S. Capitol on January 6. When rioters made their way into the Capitol, Officer Goodman confronted them, delaying their access to the Senate chamber and protecting the lives of those inside.  Officer Goodman’s bravery during that day deserves our deepest gratitude and respect for all he, and all members of the U.S. Capitol Police force, do each and every day to keep the Capitol complex, and all those working inside of it, safe. Officer Goodman should be recognized for his heroic actions that day. God bless Capitol Police and thank you, Officer Goodman, for your service. 
  
Honored to Serve You in Washington  It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.

Dear Lindsey,
 
I wanted to update you on my work in Washington, DC, and across New York's 19th congressional district.
 
January was a trying month filled with the struggle of fighting COVID-19 and the pain of an attack on our US Capitol. However, there were moments that gave me hope -- like getting to thank National Guard service members from New York who bravely protected the Capitol building or seeing communities work together to help vaccinate residents.
  
  
￼

I will keep working to deliver critical federal relief to our local governments to help administer vaccinations and continue essential services. Our local governments are our EMS, fire departments, law enforcement officers, teachers, and sanitation workers -- Congress must ensure that they remain employed and are able to continue serving residents. 
 
This month, I announced the reopening of programs like the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) and US Department of Agriculture (USDA) funding. You can learn more below about who is eligible and how to apply. 
 
Last week, my office launched our Valentines for Veterans and Vaccinators program to show love and support for those who put themselves in harm’s way to protect others. Please mail a Valentine to my office, 256 Clinton Ave, Kingston, NY, c/o Valentines for Vets and Vaccinators to lift the spirits of selfless community members.

Legislative Work



Dear friend,   Thanks for reading my Week in Review newsletter. You can sign up for my weekly updates and other issue-specific newsletters here. Please remember to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube for regular updates on how I am serving the people of South Carolina!     School Choice   Last week was school choice week, and if you didn’t know, you know now that school choice is extremely important to me. If this pandemic has taught us anything, it is that school choice matters now more than ever. With people’s livelihoods being threatened and schools being closed, many Americans have faced unexpected challenges this year. This impact was felt immediately, but we still cannot fully understand the long-term effects of keeping our children at home, especially in low-income or single parent households. It is vital that we open up more educational options for our children.   Last week, I reintroduced the CHOICE Act. This bill will increase educational options for American families by supporting parents while they find a school that best fits their child’s needs, authorizing grants for programs for children with disabilities, and more.  I will continue to fight for school choice, because when families have a choice, children succeed.   Officer Sicknick   Our country faced tragedy in the horrific attack on our nation’s Capitol last month. We must always remember and honor the selfless heroism and bravery of all the officers who defended democracy that day. That’s why I introduced a bill with Representative Ralph Norman to honor a hero who ultimately gave his life that day: Officer Brian Sicknick.   Officer Sicknick risked his life serving our country overseas and lived a life of selfless heroism, but he gave his life defending our Capitol from threats here at home. The bill we introduced last week called for him to lie in honor in the Capitol Rotunda. Our bill would also create the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund.   Congressional leadership took our bill to heart, and I was pleased that last Friday they announced Officer Sicknick will lie in honor at the Capitol this week. My prayers continue to be with Officer Sicknick’s loved ones and the family members of all of our brave law enforcement officers.   Sincerely, 
￼

2/2/21 11:10,Baldwin Introduces Bill to Expand American Production of Pandemic Supplies,"

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
Today, Senator Baldwin introduced legislation to provide a $10 billion investment in rapidly expanding the domestic manufacturing for pandemic supplies. This funding will support President Biden’s executive action and his American Rescue Plan to fully utilize the Defense Production Act (DPA) to accelerate manufacturing and delivery of medical equipment and supplies needed for our COVID-19 response.  
“For nearly a year, I’ve been calling for us to increase the national production of the medical supplies we need to fight this pandemic. Unfortunately, the Trump Administration created supply chain chaos and failed to provide our frontlines the supplies we need. We saw it with testing supplies and PPE, and now we see it with their vaccine distribution,” said Senator Baldwin. “We need to unlock the full power of the Defense Production Act to scale up production of Made in America personal protective equipment and medical supplies. President Biden is committed to fully using the Defense Production Act and to safeguard the country by producing more pandemic supplies in the U.S. He has taken action to activate authorities under the DPA and Congress must now provide the funding needed to invest in the national production of the supplies we need to get through this pandemic.” 
The country continues to experience supply chain issues that are having dangerous impacts on the nation’s response to COVID-19, as well as the nation’s ability to scale up vaccine production, distribution, and administration. President Biden’s American Rescue Plan also calls for $10 billion in funding to expand domestic manufacturing for pandemic supplies.  Recently, Senator Baldwin joined Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) in leading their colleagues in supporting President Biden’s use of executive action to utilize all authorities under the DPA that will help deploy a more functional response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On January 21, President Biden signed an Executive Order to take immediate action to fill supply shortfalls for vaccination supplies, testing supplies, and PPE, and to ensure that these critical supplies equitably reach American communities, especially communities of color and other underserved communities. President Biden’s order also directed relevant agencies to exercise all appropriate authorities, including the DPA, to accelerate manufacturing, delivery, and administration to meet shortfalls in equipment and supplies needed for the COVID-19 response, to include what is necessary to support a transparent and equitable national vaccination plan.  Since the beginning of the pandemic, Senator Baldwin has been calling for the full activation of the DPA to ramp up American production of testing supplies, PPE and medical equipment. Last year, Senator Baldwin introduced the Medical Supply Transparency and Delivery Act, which would have required former President Trump to utilize all available authorities under the Defense Production Act to mobilize a federal response to the pandemic through an equitable and transparent process. Key parts of Senator Baldwin’s legislation were included in the House-passed HEROES Act, but the former Republican majority in the Senate obstructed their legislation and failed to take action on it.  Read more about Senator Baldwin’s actions to expand American production of pandemic supplies here.

2/2/21 12:44,Congressman Jake LaTurner: We Need Congressional Term Limits,"


For Immediate Release | February 2, 2021

We Need Congressional Term Limits

￼

Read Congressman Jake LaTurner's latest op-ed on his commitment to imposing term limits on Members of Congress:

I understand that I was sent to Washington to fulfill my promises and serve the needs of my constituents. In recognition of that, I moved swiftly to co-sponsor a Constitutional Amendment that imposes term limits on all members of Congress. 

Washington, D.C., has increasingly become a place where politicians arrive with the sole objective of permanently staying in power. 

The American people are fed up with this status quo.

It turns out that when members of Congress spend every waking moment of their term consumed with their own re-election prospects, the concerns of Americans fall by the wayside. As a result, all we are left with is unsolved problems and a $27 trillion national debt (and counting!)

It is time for a major reform to the system. Thankfully, the Framers devised a brilliant method to modify our Constitution, granting us the ability to implement term limits through the amendment process.

In fact, we have already amended our Constitution to impose term limits on the office of the President. The 22nd Amendment imposed a two-term limit on the presidency as a check on executive power in government. The same logic should be applied to Congress.

The bill I co-sponsored proposes an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to limit the number of terms that a Member of Congress may serve. Members of the U.S. House of Representatives would be limited to three two-year terms of service. Members of the U.S. Senate would be limited to two six-year terms of service.

Congressional term limits will provide the Legislature with new people who have fresh ideas and are strictly focused on serving the interests of their constituents during their short time in Congress.

If we are serious about draining the swamp in Washington, term limits should be one of our top priorities.

Espaillat: Candace.Person@mail.house.gov Beyer: Aaron.Fritschner@mail.house.gov Bonamici: Natalie.Crofts@mail.house.gov Garcia: Fabiola.RodriguezCiampoli@mail.house.gov Jayapal: Chris.Evans@mail.house.gov

REP. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT LEADS DEMOCRATIC MEMBERS TO INTRODUCE IMMIGRATION PACKAGE

Members of Congress Urge Biden Administration to Consider House Led Legislation Addressing Immigrant Rights and Comprehensive Immigration Reform


WASHINGTON, DC — Last week, Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13), joined by Suzanne Bonamici (OR-01), Donald S. Beyer Jr. (VA-08), Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), and Jesús “Chuy” García (IL-04) introduced a critical legislative package to protect immigrant rights.

""My colleagues and I are re-introducing this series of bills, a legislative package that will protect immigrants, immigrant families, and uphold the promises of the American dream,"" said Congressman Adriano Espaillat. ""Simply put, this legislative package puts forth policies to correct the atrocities we witnessed during the previous administration. We urge President Biden to consider our legislative package as his administration prioritzes keeping families together and rolling out the framework on which we will build to finally realize comprehensive immigration reform once and for all.""  

“For four years immigrant families have borne the brunt of racist and nativist policies that betrayed America’s values,” said Congressman Don Beyer. “I witnessed the pain and suffering those polices caused, from tearful fathers whose children were torn away from them, to young children in my district whose mother was deported for driving with a broken tail light. I stood with community leaders who were outraged by ICE shakedowns at a hypothermia shelter in a place of worship, a violation of standing policy. This legislation would finally help restore humane immigration policies after four years of abuses and human rights violations.”

""We must remedy the terrible harm the previous administration caused to immigrants and mixed-status families, who are invaluable members of our community,"" said Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici. ""This package of legislation places needed checks on the tactics and conduct of ICE. Importantly, the legislation will expedite the reunion of children and families who were torn apart by Trump’s shameful and unjust family separation policy. I look forward to working with my colleagues to get these measures signed into law by President Biden.""

“Everyone, including immigrants in Chicago and across the country, deserves to feel safe when they go to school, see a doctor, practice their faith, or mourn the loss of loved ones. Instead, families live in constant fear of deportation. This legislative package will overturn some of Trump’s most egregious immigration enforcement tactics, including the practice of family separation,” said Congressman Jesús ""Chuy"" García. “The legislation also increases oversight of the Department of Homeland Security and holds ICE and CBP agents accountable by requiring the use of body cameras. In order to move forward, we must right our country’s past wrongs and ensure the rights of immigrants are protected.”

“As America begins a new presidential administration, we need to finally leave our country’s long xenophobic history of criminalizing immigration and separating families behind,” said Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal. “As one of only 14 naturalized citizens serving in Congress, I am proud to help introduce this legislative package as we work to reunite every family who has been cruelly torn apart, dramatically increase accountability and oversight measures, and stop ICE from terrorizing immigrants, our families, and our communities.”

The bills, which were first introduced in 2017 and 2018, seek to prevent a number of the most egregious immigration enforcement tactics witnessed during the Trump Administration and protect the rights of immigrants so no future administration can repeat these horrible actions.

One of the bills, the Protecting Sensitive Locations Act, will prohibit immigration enforcement in certain “sensitive locations” such as courthouses, schools, community centers and houses of worship, a tactic for targeting vulnerable immigrant communities that was common under the Trump Administration.

Another measure, the Reunite Every Unaccompanied Newborn Infant Toddler and Other Children Expeditiously (REUNITE) Act, would require the immediate reunification of children who were separated from their parent or legal guardian as a result of the administration’s “zero tolerance” policy.

Finally, the ICE and CBP Body Camera Accountability Act would require Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Patrol officers to wear body cameras and would make footage available for any legal proceedings.

The proposals have been endorsed by a number of leading advocacy groups outlined below:

Protecting Sensitive Locations Act: Asian Pacific Institute on Gender-Based Violence, Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations (AAPCHO), California Immigrant Policy Center (CIPC), Casa de Esperanza: National Latin@ Network, Casa San Jose, Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP), Church World Service, Coalition on Human Needs (CHN), Congregation of Our Lady of Charity of the Good Shepherd, US Provinces, Farmworker Justice, Franciscan Action Network, Hispanic Federation, Lawyers for Children, League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), The Legal Aid Society (New York), Maryknoll Office for Global Concerns, Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition (MIRA), National Advocacy Center of the Sisters of the Good Shepherd, National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, National Asian Pacific American Women's Forum, National Alliance for Hispanic Health, National Council of Jewish Women, National Education Association, National Health Care for the Homeless Council, National Human Services Assembly, National Immigration Law Center, National WIC Association, NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice, New York Immigration Coalition, Sisters of Mercy of the Americas Justice Team

REP. ADRIANO ESPAILLAT LIDERA A MIEMBROS DEMÓCRATAS EN INTRODUCCIÓN DE PAQUETE DE INMIGRACIÓN

Miembros del Congreso instan a la administración Biden a considerar un paquete legislativo liderado por la Cámara de Representantes que aborda los derechos de los inmigrantes y una reforma migratoria integral


WASHINGTON, DC — La semana pasada, el congresista Adriano Espaillat (NY-13), acompañado por Suzanne Bonamici (OR-01), Donald S. Beyer Jr. (VA-08), Pramila Jayapal (WA-07) y Jesús “Chuy” García (IL- 04), introdujo un paquete legislativo crucial para proteger los derechos de los inmigrantes.

""Mis colegas y yo estamos volviendo a introducir esta serie de proyectos de ley, un paquete legislativo que protegerá a los inmigrantes, las familias inmigrantes y mantendrá las promesas del Sueño Americano"", dijo el congresista Adriano Espaillat. ""En pocas palabras, este paquete legislativo propone políticas para corregir las atrocidades que presenciamos durante la administración anterior. Instamos al presidente Biden a que considere nuestro paquete legislativo, ya que su administración prioriza mantener unidas a las familias, y desarrollar el marco sobre el que construiremos para realizar una reforma migratoria integral de una vez por todas"".

“Durante cuatro años, las familias inmigrantes han soportado la peor parte de las políticas racistas y nativistas que traicionaron los valores estadounidenses”, dijo el congresista Don Beyer. “Yo fui testigo del dolor y sufrimiento que causaron esas políticas, desde padres llorosos cuyos hijos les fueron arrebatados, hasta niños pequeños en mi distrito cuya madre fue deportada por conducir con una luz trasera rota. Estuve con los líderes comunitarios que estaban indignados por las batidas de ICE en un refugio de hipotermia en un lugar de culto, una violación de la política vigente. Esta legislación finalmente ayudaría a restaurar las políticas de inmigración humanas después de cuatro años de abusos y violaciones de derechos humanos”.

""Debemos remediar el terrible daño que la administración anterior causó a los inmigrantes y las familias de estatus mixto, que son miembros invaluables de nuestra comunidad"", dijo la congresista Suzanne Bonamici. ""Este paquete legislativo coloca los controles necesarios sobre las tácticas y la conducta de ICE. Es importante destacar que la legislación acelerará la reunión de los niños y las familias que fueron destrozados por la vergonzosa e injusta política de separación familiar de Trump. Espero con entusiasmo trabajar con mis colegas para lograr que estas medidas se conviertan en ley por parte del presidente Biden"".

“Todos, incluidos los inmigrantes en Chicago y en todo el país, merecen sentirse seguros cuando vayan a la escuela, consulten a un médico, practiquen su fe o lamenten la pérdida de sus seres queridos. En cambio, estas familias viven con el temor constante de ser deportadas. Este paquete legislativo anulará algunas de las tácticas de control migratorio más atroces de Trump, incluida la práctica de la separación familiar”, dijo el congresista Jesús ""Chuy"" García. “La legislación también aumenta la supervisión del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional y hace rendir cuentas a los agentes de ICE y CBP al exigir el uso de cámaras corporales. Para avanzar, debemos corregir los errores pasados de nuestro país y garantizar la protección de los derechos de los inmigrantes"".

“A medida que Estados Unidos comienza una nueva administración presidencial, debemos finalmente dejar atrás la larga historia xenófoba de nuestro país de criminalizar la inmigración y separar familias”, dijo la congresista Pramila Jayapal. “Como uno de los 14 ciudadanos naturalizados que sirven en el Congreso, me enorgullece ayudar a presentar este paquete legislativo mientras trabajamos para reunificar a todas las familias que han sido cruelmente separadas, aumentar drásticamente las medidas de rendición de cuentas y supervisión y evitar que ICE aterrorice a los inmigrantes, nuestras familias y nuestras comunidades"".

Los proyectos de ley, que se presentaron por primera vez en 2017 y 2018, buscan prevenir una serie de las tácticas más atroces de aplicación de la ley de inmigración observadas durante la Administración Trump y proteger los derechos de los inmigrantes para que ninguna administración futura pueda repetir estas horribles acciones.
Uno de los proyectos de ley, la Ley de Protección de Lugares Sensibles, prohibirá la aplicación de la ley de inmigración en ciertos ""lugares sensibles"" como juzgados, escuelas, centros comunitarios y lugares de culto, una táctica dirigida a las comunidades de inmigrantes vulnerables que se volvió común bajo la Administración Trump.
Otra medida, la Ley de Reunir sin Demora a cada Niño Recién Nacido que Llegue sin Acompañante y a otros Niños (REUNITE), requeriría la reunificación inmediata de los niños que fueron separados de sus padres o tutores legales como resultado de la política de ""tolerancia cero"" de la administración.
Finalmente, la Ley de Rendición de Cuentas de ICE y CBP con el Porte de Cámaras Corporales requeriría que los agentes del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas y de la Oficina de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza usen cámaras corporales y pongan las imágenes disponibles para cualquier procedimiento legal.
Las propuestas han sido respaldadas por varios de los principales grupos de defensa de los inmigrantes que se describen a continuación:

Representing Texas on the House Agriculture Committee
￼
￼
￼
￼
I'm excited to announce I'm joining the House Agriculture Committee! The committee maintains jurisdiction relating to the U.S. agriculture industry, trade, and markets, as well as food transparency, forestry, nutrition, conservation, and rural development. I'm honored to be the only Texas Republican on the Agriculture Committee. I look forward to helping develop policy that can support our agricultural industry and life in rural communities. I will work to ensure people in overlooked places have a strong voice in Washington. 

Farming and ranching are essential to our country’s success. There could be no more basic national security issue than to ensure a sustainable and affordable food supply. America’s farmers and ranchers face unique challenges, including high cost of production, a shrinking workforce, natural disasters and burdensome federal regulations. We must work to ensure favorable economic conditions necessary for U.S. agriculture workers to flourish here at home and open up trade opportunities abroad. We have also seen how detrimental it can be when essential supplies are based elsewhere. We must work to ensure the most basic security — a U.S. based food supply — while finding new opportunities for export around the world.

The agriculture industry not only contributes to local, state, and national economies but also promotes international diplomacy. While countries like China work to undermine the United States’ interests, the U.S. can and will use American agriculture to strengthen ties to our allies. The export of American agricultural products plays a critical role in the nation’s economy, and strong trade agreements provide good-paying jobs and higher revenues for farmers and ranchers. I helped lead the effort to pass the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) as a part of the USMCA Task Force.

Trade policy has a real-life impact on the lives and work of our farmers and ranchers in South Texas, so we are going to keep working for strong international trade agreements.

The House Steering Committee recommends this assignment, and it will go before the House Republican Conference to be ratified. Subcommittee assignments have yet to be announced.

Fox Business Interview: Mornings with Maria
￼
￼
￼
￼
There are certainly a number of policy issues that could gain bipartisan support and help the American people. However, the Biden Administration has so far been more interested in partisan actions that undo much of the great progress our country has made. 

Already in the first week, we have seen executive actions that are counterproductive to a secure border or encouraging healthy, legal immigration. 

Meanwhile, Big Tech is colluding to suppress free speech. I question the motives of companies that permit the Chinese Communist Party to freely post but limit Americans.

I joined Mornings with Maria to discuss these issues. Watch the interview HERE or check out this Newsmax article summarizing the interview.

Standing Up for the Preborn
￼
￼
￼
￼
After eight years of hostility toward the preborn under the Obama administration, the last four years were a breath of fresh air for pro-life Americans. Planned Parenthood chose to walk away from Title X funds in order to continue committing abortions due to a Trump administration rule change, and for the first time in history, a sitting U.S. President spoke at a pro-life march in Washington. 
 
While the Biden Administration is working to roll back much of the progress pro-lifers have made over the last four years, we will persevere. Now more than ever, it is important to hold the line and stand for life. That’s why the first bill I introduced in the 117th Congress is a pro-life bill advocating for the preborn and their pregnant mothers in need. 

The Women’s Public Health and Safety Act will ensure that states have the right to exclude abortion facilities from receiving their Medicaid dollars. This Act will empower states to end the bankrolling of abortion providers and free up funding for healthcare initiatives for those providers which put the wellbeing of women and babies first. You can read more about my bill HERE. 

My thoughts and support are with the folks throughout the country who continue to hold the line for the pro-life movement and the preborn. We will not give up the fight for life!

Bringing Texas National Guard Troops Stationed at U.S. Capitol Home
￼
￼
￼
￼
I was shocked to see pictures and read reports of the National Guardsmen stationed at the U.S. Capitol being moved from indoors out into the garages. I will continue to monitor this situation and encourage an investigation into the matter. Now that their mission is over, I fully endorse Governor Abbott's decision to bring the Texas National Guard troops back to Texas.

Weekly Wrap-Up with 
Congressman Byron Donalds
February 2, 2021
 
 
This week begins a historical celebration for millions of Americans. Black History Month is a time to celebrate and honor the hardworking Black Americans that have shaped this nation. Each week during February, my office will celebrate and recognize Black Americans who have played an integral role in crafting America's history. During this month, my office will highlight a local SWFL figure that has transformed our community. 
 
Additionally, the Biden Administration continued to lead from behind a desk with a plethora of Executive Orders aimed at undoing the previous president's legacy and bowing to the AOC wing of the party. As a member of the Legislative Branch, I am discouraged by this lazy leadership taking place from the Oval Office. President Biden must reach out to Congress, the branch responsible for legislating, for furthering his executive agenda. The 117th Congress is composed of the slimmest margins since WWII. The Biden Presidency will have to reach across the aisle to pass vital legislation for the American people.  
 
 

 
 
Black History Month
 
WASHINGTON- Today, Congressman Byron Donalds (R-FL) issued the following statement in recognition of Black History Month. 
 
""Black History Month is when our nation comes together to reflect on the Black community's immense contributions to our country's storied history. The promise of America is my life's story- born into inner-city Brooklyn, the son of a single mother, to being elected to the most powerful legislative body in the world. Today and every day, we pay homage to patriots like Sojourner Truth, Booker T. Washington, General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., Katherine Johnson, Justice Clarence Thomas, and generations of American heroes who devoted their lives to form a more perfect union.""

National School Choice Week
 
National School Choice Week is about celebrating children, empowering parents, and educational freedom. No child is the same, and each of them learns differently- which is why educational options are vital for every child to succeed and to have access to a world-class education.
 
 
From the streets of inner-city Brooklyn, to the halls of Congress- I am proud to share my success story that has been guided by faith, my mother’s love and dedication, and my access to an education of my choice.
 
Your zip code should never determine your academic future.

The Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance (PLGHA) Act prevents taxpayer-funded global health programs from funding non-governmental organizations that perform, lobby, and promote abortion. Last week, President Joe Biden repealed this vital legislation. 
 
On Friday, January 29th, I signed on to letter with over 130 of my Republican colleagues in a letter to President Biden addressing thispainful procedure that terminates a child's life. My colleagues and I called on to President Biden to reverse this decision and re-instate the PLGHA. The U.S. taxpayer should not be forced in to funding foreign abortions.

Daines Fights for Pro-Life Priorities
￼
 
To watch my full speech on the U.S. Senate floor, click HERE.
 
Last week, I spoke on the floor of the United States Senate on the importance of protecting babies with Down syndrome from abortion.
Sadly, 67% percent of babies diagnosed with Down syndrome are aborted. 
As founder and chair of the Senate Pro Life Caucus, I also helped introduce a slate of bills to protect life including legislation to prevent taxpayer funding for abortion, protect babies with down syndrome from abortions, and save babies born alive from botched abortions. 
One of my top priorities as Montana's United States Senator is protecting the unborn.
The Senate remains the firewall for protecting life against the radical Left's pro-abortion agenda. I'm going to do all I can to ensure we stand up for the most vulnerable and prevent any tax dollars going to the abortion industry.
I have been, and will continue to be, a strong voice against President Biden's actions to eliminate President Trump's pro-life policies at home and abroad. Read more about my fight HERE.
Here is a list of pro-life bills I'm pushing this Congress:
Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act–This bill prohibits the elective abortion of unborn children after 20 weeks, protecting these children based on evidence that by then, they experience pain.
Support and Value Expectant (SAVE) Moms and Babies Act –This bill prevents labeling changes for already approved abortion drugs; prevents providers from dispensing these abortion drugs remotely, by mail, or via tele-medicine; and prevents the Food and Drug Administration from approving new chemical abortion drugs.
No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act–This bill codifies the Hyde Amendment, prohibiting federal funding for elective abortion, as a permanent government-wide prohibition. It also restricts Obamacare’s premium tax credits from being used for elective abortion coverage on the exchanges.
Protecting Individuals with Down Syndrome Act – This billprohibits a doctor from knowingly performing an abortion when it is being sought because the baby has Down syndrome.
Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act –This bill would ensure that babies born alive after failed abortions are given the same medical care as any other baby born prematurely at the same gestational age.
Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act – This bill bars Title X family planning funding for abortion providers like Planned Parenthood.
Life at Conception Act – This bill declares that the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being, beginning from the moment of conception.
Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act (PRENDA) –This bill prohibits sex-selection abortion.
Dignity for Aborted Children Act – This bill requires the burial or cremation of an unborn child after an abortion is performed.
Protecting Life in Foreign Assistance Act – This bill codifies and expands the Mexico City Policy to prohibit foreign aid from being given to organizations that perform or actively promote abortions overseas.
Abortion is Not Health Care Act – This bill prohibits abortion from being considered eligible for the medical expenses deduction.
Protecting Life and Integrity in Research Act– This bill prohibits federal funding for research involving human fetal tissue taken from unborn children killed by abortion.
Protecting Life in a Crisis Act – This bill extends Hyde Amendment protections, prohibiting taxpayer funding for elective abortion, to any COVID-19-related healthcare provisions, including any subsidies for Obamacare exchange plans and COBRA continuation coverage.
Women's Public Health and Safety Act – This bill clarifies the authority of states to exclude providers of elective abortion like Planned Parenthood from the state’s Medicaid program.

 Thought of the day: “Hope is important because it can make the present moment less difficult to bear. If we believe that tomorrow will be better, we can bear a hardship today.” – Thich Nhat Hanh
Coronavirus Update

On Monday, Michigan reported 2,066 new cases of COVID-19 and 8 new deaths, bringing the state’s total cases to 561,307 and deaths to 14,609. Gov. Whitmer’s quick actions to protect Michiganders has resulted in case and death counts trending in a hopeful direction since the surge that started in November.
Vaccines are continuing to be delivered to states. On Monday, Michigan reported 1,735,525 COVID vaccines have been distributed and, of that, 1,001,873 vaccines have been administered. Last week, Michigan ranked 6th in the U.S. for the number of doses. Currently, Michigan is prioritizing available vaccines for those 65 and older, front-line workers, some state and federal workers, jail and prison staff, Pre-K through 12th-grade teachers, and childcare providers. Michigan is working hard to get vaccines into as many arms as possible, as quickly as possible. We were challenged with receiving fewer supplies than promised, along with other issues that have arisen, but the State and local governments are trying to address this as quickly as possible and numbers are increasing steadily.
After inheriting a disjointed vaccine rollout, President Biden’s Administration has hit the reset button and developed a vaccination plan based on the advice of health experts. Under President Biden, Democratic and Republican governors alike have expressed how much better vaccine distributions have become. Dr. Anthony Fauci said this week that vaccine distribution will “get better very quickly” with the Biden Administration taking a number of actions to speed up vaccinations and save lives, including discussions on how the Pentagon can use military personnel to aid in vaccine distribution.
The Biden Administration has also announced an increase in weekly vaccine supply for states, tribal governments, and U.S. territories. Next week, the Administration will begin the first phase of their federal pharmacy program, which will empower select pharmacies across the nation to start vaccinating within their community. The Administration has also announced retroactive reimbursements to states for FEMA-eligible services, including masks, gloves, emergency food services, sheltering at-risk populations, and mobilization of the National Guard.  On the COVID relief front, Congress is moving with urgency to pass President Biden’s American Rescue Plan. This week, the House will consider legislation to give Congress an additional tool to pass President Biden’s relief package that will support vaccination efforts, give families and workers the assistance they need, and start building back our economy. Anything less than the Administration’s American Recovery Plan is a band aid that will require further action in the near future and slow the return of our economy.
On Monday, S&P Global published an analysis of the President’s American Rescue Plan, finding that the plan “would reach pre-crisis levels in the second quarter of 2021, with a stronger demand-driven path of growth through 2023.” Additionally, S&P projects that President Biden’s plan would reduce unemployment to below 4 percent by mid-2023. 
 Legislative Update
This week in Congress, we are working hard to address the needs of the American people. Today, in the Energy and Commerce Committee, we heard from leading health officials from across the country, including Michigan’s own Chief Medical Executive Dr. Khaldun, on real solutions to speed up COVID vaccinations across the country.
Today, I will be reintroducing my bipartisan TREAT Act, which will empower licensed health care professionals to provide care to their patients from any state during the current public health crisis, without penalty. Through the TREAT Act, we can utilize new technology to treat patients while keeping them safe. Enacting policies like this one will be critical in our efforts to end this pandemic.
Also today, the House will vote on the National Apprenticeship Act, which invests over $3 billion into apprenticeship opportunities and creates nearly one million new Registered Apprenticeship, youth apprenticeship, and pre-apprenticeship position. This legislation is a win for a reliable pipeline of union jobs for years to come.

2/2/21 17:47,President Biden Brings Back Job-Destroying Energy Policies,"

If you are having trouble viewing this message or would like to share it on a social network, you can view the message online.￼

￼





Dear Lindsey,
 
President Biden wasted no time kicking his administration off with a slew of failed Obama-era energy policies that will destroy jobs, raise costs where we live, and make our economy less competitive.
 
Failed Energy Policy #1: Halting the Keystone XL Pipeline
 
A few hours after swearing his oath of office, President Biden took a page right out of President Obama’s playbook. He revoked a presidential permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, forcing immediate layoffs. 
 
The Obama administration, along with congressional Democrats, delayed the Keystone XL pipeline project for years. President Trump approved a permit for the project in July 2020. Since then, thousands of Americans have been working on the project and thousands more were expected to be hired this year.
 
One of the largest trade unions in America strongly opposed the move, saying it “will reduce good-paying union jobs that allow workers to provide a middle-class standard of living to their families. America needs access to various forms of energy that can keep its economy running in the years ahead. This decision will hurt that effort.”
 
Now, at a time when our economy is still recovering from the pandemic, President Biden did away with thousands of jobs and undermined American energy security with the stroke of a pen. 
 
And what for? Nothing. Even a past environmental review by President Obama’s own State Department found that the pipeline would have no significant impact.
 
Failed Energy Policy #2: Rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement
 
In 2015, President Obama completely ignored the Senate’s duty to advise and consent on treaties and joined the Paris climate agreement. I opposed this move in 2015 and I oppose it now.
 
The commitments under the Paris agreement would have a sweeping impact across our economy. Previous analysis found the Obama administration’s Paris emissions pledge could cost trillions of dollars and cause the loss of millions of jobs.
 
Under this agreement, the U.S. is obligated to send billions of dollars to developing countries for climate mitigation.
 
The Paris agreement also hurts America’s competitiveness by allowing our adversaries to increase emissions while we place extensive restrictions on ourselves.
 
Under President Trump, the United States formally withdrew from the Paris agreement. I completely supported that move.
 
Unfortunately, just hours into his administration, President Biden re-committed the United States to this deeply flawed, job-crushing agreement.
 
Failed Energy Policy #3: Banning New Oil and Gas Leases on Public Lands and Federal Waters
 
Continuing his trend of leading by executive fiat, President Biden issued yet another sweeping Executive Order. This time, he ordered the Department of the Interior to stop new leases for oil and gas production on public lands and offshore waters.
 
An analysis found that a ban on energy production on federal lands and waters could cost an estimated one million jobs by 2022. By 2030, U.S. GDP could be cut by a cumulative $700 billion.
 
The same analysis found that such a ban could also mean we would likely have to import energy sources from overseas. This would export American energy jobs to places like China, Russia, Venezuela, the Middle East, and Africa.
 
For 8 years, the Obama administration saddled our economy with excessive, burdensome regulations. After we rolled back miles of Obama-era red tape, our economy thrived before the pandemic. Now, because President Biden is bringing back these failed energy policies, we’re back to square one.
 
We need an all-of-the-above energy policy, especially where we live. With energy-intensive industries like agriculture and manufacturing, we stand to lose even more when costs go up. Higher energy bills will hit lower-income families the hardest at a time when they can least afford it. Unfortunately, these early moves don’t bode well for what lies ahead – more burdensome regulations with little to no benefit, and more bureaucratic overreach from Washington.
 
I fought these moves during the Obama administration. I supported President Trump’s all-of-the-above American energy strategy and I will continue to advocate for policies that protect Missouri families, farmers, and small businesses.

BROADBAND 
Take a Speed Test Here. 
The sad fact is that many places in West Virginia simply do not have access to reliable broadband and the lack of access affects West Virginians every day. Back in 2015, the FCC released a coverage map that stated 99.9% of Americans had wireless coverage. I knew then what I know now: That is just plain wrong.

MANCHIN VOTES TO CONFIRM TRANSPORTATION SECRETARY BUTTIGIEG   Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) voted to confirm Pete Buttigieg as U.S. Secretary of Transportation.    “Today I voted to confirm Pete Buttigieg as Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation. Secretary Buttigieg understands the need for a strong infrastructure plan to help fix our crumbling roads and bridges and create jobs for hard-working Americans and West Virginians through economic development and reinvestment in our communities. Transportation is vital to West Virginia and I look forward to working with Secretary Buttigieg on West Virginia priorities including the completion of Corridor H, Coalfields Expressway, Route 35, King Coal Highway and other key roadways, continued support for vital air services to small communities and investing in railways that connect rural America to the rest of the nation."" 
MANCHIN, CORNYN REINTRODUCE BILL TO REQUIRE COMPANIES REPORT ILLICIT ONLINE DRUG SALES  Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and John Cornyn (R-TX) reintroduced the See Something, Say Something Online Act to stop the illicit sale of opioids and other drugs online by amending Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to require companies report illegal activity on their online platforms.  ""The Internet has drastically changed since Section 230 was written in 1996 and while it keeps us all more connected than ever before, it also makes it easier to conduct illegal activity online. Each year, authorities seize enough fentanyl to kill every American four times over, much of it ordered over the Internet and sent by mail from China,"" said Senator Manchin. ""We must amend Section 230 to better reflect the way the Internet impacts our lives today – both good and bad. Senator Cornyn and I reintroduced our bipartisan legislation that uses a commonsense approach to create a clear mechanism for reporting criminal activity online, requiring companies to take reasonable steps to report unlawful activity or be held liable for that failure. Congress has failed to keep up with a quickly changing Internet and it is past time we held these sites accountable.""

The CoC awards were provided in the year-end stimulus package and help to quickly rehouse homeless individuals and families in West Virginia.  ""Many of our fellow West Virginians are currently experiencing homelessness including children and families, and the COVID-19 pandemic has only made this horrible issue worse,"" said Senator Manchin. “I am pleased HUD is supporting 21 organizations across West Virginia and continue to be incredibly proud of their efforts to provide safe beds and a warm place to sleep for our fellow West Virginians. We must continue to work together to address homelessness and ensure all West Virginians have a roof over their head each night."" 
MANCHIN, CAPITO ANNOUNCE ASSISTANCE TO FIREFIGHTERS GRANT TO RANSON INDEPENDENT FIRE CO.

No. 1 in Ranson, West Virginia. This funding was made available through FEMA’s Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) program.  ""The brave men and women of the Ranson Independent Fire Co.

Senator Manchin continues to push for transparency and accountability at the VA after the murders at the Clarksburg Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC) and the sexual abuses at the Beckley VAMC.  ""Let me tell you what we’ve faced in the past few years…Knowing that we have Veterans who were murdered in the Clarksburg Veterans hospital…We’ve had sexual abuses found in the Beckley VA hospital…There’s a breakdown there somewhere and we’re going to need someone like you (McDonough) who can dig into that to put the credibility back in the VA and the desire to provide the care our Veterans deserve…My grandmother used to say people don’t care how much you know until they know how much you care, I know how much you (McDonough) care,"" said Senator Manchin in part. 
MANCHIN, CAPITO ANNOUNCE $600K FOR WEST VIRGINIA UNIVERSITY PROGRAM TO SUPPORT SMALL MANUFACTURERS ACROSS WEST VIRGINIA  Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $600,000 from the U.S Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology to the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership (MEP) at West Virginia University (WVU). The WVU MEP program works with small and midsize U.S. manufacturing companies to provide technological assistance and other services to help increase profits and create and retain jobs.  ""The Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership at West Virginia University has helped small West Virginia manufacturers create sustainable jobs and provide opportunities for growth through technology and innovation for several decades,"" said Senator Manchin. “I’m pleased the Department of Commerce is continuing to invest in our growing manufacturing industry here in the Mountain State.

Energy Committee News
MANCHIN STATEMENT ON BIDEN’S LATEST ROUND OF CLIMATE EXECUTIVE ORDERS   Washington, DC U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), incoming Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, today released the following statement on President Biden’s latest round of climate executive orders.  ""Last night, I spoke with White House officials about today’s executive orders. They informed me they are pausing new oil and gas leases on federal lands in order to fully evaluate the state of production on current leases. Currently, 53% of onshore acres leased and 77% of offshore acres leased have no active production. It is prudent to evaluate if taxpayers are receiving a fair return for the use of their resources. This executive order will not impact energy activity like drilling or permitting on existing leases.  I also reiterated my strong commitment to advancing innovative energy technologies in order to address climate change while maintaining our energy independence. Instead of elimination, we must instead  focus on utilizing all of our resources in the cleanest way possible. Today’s executive orders also commit the Biden Administration to focus on reinvesting in communities that have seen the loss of traditional energy jobs, like many in West Virginia. I intend to hold the Administration to this while ensuring that the burden of any acceleration in already changing markets is not unduly placed on these communities that powered our nation to greatness. I stand ready to work with this Administration to ensure West Virginia communities see these much needed investments.""

But let me be clear – and these are words I shared with President Biden – our focus must be targeted on the COVID-19 crisis and Americans who have been most impacted by this pandemic. The President remains hopeful that we can have bipartisan support moving forward. I will only support proposals that will get us through and end the pain of this pandemic. For the sake of the country, we must work together with laser focus to defeat the COVID-19 crisis, support our neighbors and communities who continue to suffer and get back to a more normal life as quickly as possible.""  
MANCHIN, WARNER, CAPITO, DURBIN, KAINE, CASEY, BROWN, CARTWRIGHT INTRODUCE BILL TO PROTECT MINERS FROM COVID-19 EXPOSURE  Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), Mark Warner (D-VA), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Bob Casey (D-PA), and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) and Representative Matt Cartwright (D-PA) introduced the bipartisan, bicameral COVID-19 Mine Worker Protection Act which would require the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) to issue an emergency temporary standard requiring mine operators to establish a plan to tackle occupational COVID-19 exposure and provide miners with the necessary personal protective equipment (PPE). Additional information on the COVID-19 Mine Worker Protection Act can be found here.   ""Our miners risk their lives every day to power our nation and during the COVID-19 pandemic, that risk is even greater for our brave miners,"" said Senator Manchin. ""The bipartisan, bicameral COVID-19 Mine Worker Protection Act will instruct DOL to create safeguards and provide PPE to ensure our miners are protected from exposure to COVID-19 in the mines.

MANCHIN APPLAUDS PRESIDENT BIDEN’S EXECUTIVE ORDER TO REOPEN ACA ENROLLMENT FOR UNINSURED AMERICANS  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) applauded President Biden’s Executive Order to open the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for a Special Enrollment Period from February 15th to May 15th to allow uninsured Americans to apply for coverage during the COVID-19 pandemic that has taken the lives of nearly 2,000 West Virginians and over 427,000 Americans.   ""Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, I pushed the Trump Administration to reopen the ACA online marketplace. This would have allowed Americans – who lost their coverage through no fault of their own – apply for health insurance, but they wouldn’t budge,"" said Senator Manchin. ""Within the first two weeks of his Administration, President Biden has announced an ACA Special Enrollment Period. Now, families will have access to the online marketplace, giving many Americans immediate peace of mind knowing their loved ones will have healthcare during this global health crisis. I am pleased with President Biden’s announcement and will continue to work closely with the Administration to help West Virginians receive critical healthcare coverage during these difficult times."" 
MANCHIN LEADS DELEGATION CALL FOR ADMINISTRATION’S PRIORITIZATION OF WEST VIRGINIA IN NEXT COVID-19 VACCINE DISTRIBUTION  Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) and Representatives Carol Miller, David McKinley and Alex Mooney sent a letter to the Biden Administration urging its prioritization of West Virginia in the next round of COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Addressed to Acting Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Norris Cochran and Acting Department of Defense Secretary David Norquist, the letter cites West Virginia’s record for successful vaccine distribution and the high number of at-risk West Virginians as reasons for the request.  ""I thank the Biden Administration for the quick actions they have taken in the past week to increase vaccines across the country,"" said Senator Manchin. ""West Virginia continues to lead the nation in COVID-19 vaccinations, proving our state is prepared to receive an increase in the next COVID-19 vaccine distribution so our frontline workers, healthcare professionals and all West Virginians who want a vaccination can receive one as additional doses become available. As the state with the highest rate of people at-risk for complications from COVID-19, prioritizing the Mountain State in the next vaccine distribution just makes sense. I look forward to continuing to work with the Biden Administration as they work to improve vaccine supply and distribute additional doses for West Virginians."" 
MANCHIN, CAPITO ANNOUNCE $1.6 MILLION FOR WEST VIRGINIA COVID-19 VACCINATION COSTS  Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, today announced $1,648,653 from the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) to assist the state of West Virginia in distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. Specifically, this funding will be used to reimburse costs associated with emergency protective measures taken to store, handle, transport, distribute, and administer vaccines to reduce the spread the of the virus.  ""West Virginia is leading by example when it comes to COVID-19 vaccine distribution and I’m pleased FEMA is providing additional funding to West Virginia’s National Guard and the Cabell-Huntington Health Department,"" said Senator Manchin. ""These grants will help West Virginia continue to safely and efficiently distribute the vaccine once additional doses become available. I will continue to work with the Biden Administration to quickly procure additional doses and advocate for funding to ensure every West Virginian who wants a vaccine can get one as soon as possible."" 
MANCHIN, ROUNDS, SMITH, HASSAN, KING, SHAHEEN CALL ON FCC TO PRIORITIZE SMALL RURAL PROVIDERS FOR COVID-19 TELEHEALTH PROGRAM  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Tina Smith (D-MN), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Angus King (I-ME) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) called on the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to ensure small rural providers receive their fair share of the COVID-19 Telehealth Program funding authorized in the recent year-end stimulus package.  The Senators said in part, ""All across the country our healthcare providers, first responders, and Americans of all walks of life have adjusted to a new way of receiving and giving care due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the past few months, we have seen that telemedicine can provide a lifeline to essential health care services through specialized connected care that was previously only available in person… It is critical that all areas across the United States have access to telehealth and telemedicine during this difficult time. In order to ensure that funding reaches the areas across our country that need help the most, and need it now, we call on the FCC to target funds to small providers in rural areas.""  The letter can be read in full by clicking here.

￼
President Biden's ""Unity"" Pledge
Less than two weeks ago, President Biden stood in front of the Capitol and stressed unity and healing. He expressed respect for those who did not vote for him and committed to working with Congress. And then he got to the White House and immediately started a record-breaking, left-wing executive order binge that has not stopped. Some of the actions include:
	•	Halting new oil and gas leases on public lands, which will drive up energy prices for American families;
	•	Revoking the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, a key infrastructure project with bipartisan support, the meritless termination of which will cost thousands of good paying jobs;
	•	Encouraging sanctuary cities that subvert federal law in order to shield illegal immigrants, including violent criminals;
	•	Rejoining the ineffective Paris Climate Accord which will have a negligible impact on the environment while disadvantaging American businesses against their foreign competitors.
These unilateral, partisan actions to unwind the work of the previous administration create an unpredictable regulatory environment that undermines any economic recovery while dividing us even further. Unifying the country requires more than just words, and it is time for President Biden to take tangible action that matches his aspirational tone.

Protecting All Life
Every year, thousands of Americans go to Washington D.C. to participate in the March for Life. While this year's virtual march this past Friday was different from marches in the past, the cause was no less important. No other movement is as dedicated to reaffirming the belief that all life is sacred and must be protected.
I do not support using American taxpayer dollars to fund or facilitate abortion. President Biden used to hold the same position, until it became untenable within the Democratic party. And while the president has talked at length about unity and healing, he signed a divisive executive order on Thursday - the day before the March for Life - allowing American taxpayer dollars to be spent on abortions around the world. A Marist Poll conducted this month proves that this executive order in contrary to the consensus of the American people: more than three in four Americans oppose using taxpayer dollars to support abortion in other countries.
I am grateful to all those who have marched in the past, and participated on Friday. The effort to protect the most vulnerable among us is as important as ever.

Update on COVID-19
In the past few weeks, Pennsylvania and the rest of the country have experienced a concerning jump in new COVID-19 cases. While vaccines are now available, the threat of this virus is still very real.
It remains important that people continue to follow CDC recommendations: adhere to social distancing guidelines, wash your hands often, and wear a mask if you are heading out. Remember: my mask protects you and your mask protects me.
According to the Pennsylvania Department of Health, across the state as of Friday, January 29, 2021:
	•	Over 15% of all hospital beds were available (pre-COVID, approximately 36.82% of hospital beds were typically available)
	•	Over 70% of ventilators were available
	•	Over 15% of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds were available (pre-COVID, approximately 32.6% of ICU beds were typically available)
As of that date, positive cases in Pennsylvania reached 834,048, roughly a 1% increase from the prior day, and more than 3,611,300 tests had come back negative. This means almost 81% of Pennsylvanians tested for COVID-19 had a result that came back negative.

For more detailed information about resources available to you, visit the COVID-19 resource page on my website.

Futher Information:

The Centers for Disease Control provides updates on the virus and safety information for the public and healthcare professionals here.

The Pennsylvania Department of Health provides information on the virus and safety precautions here.

I encourage all Pennsylvanians to take this situation very seriously and observe the recommendations developed by the CDC.

Home     Serving You     Contact     District     Legislation     Newsroom     About Bob 
Dear Friend, 
As we begin a new year, citizens, workers, and small businesses in Ohio still need relief from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Below are important updates on relief efforts:
￼
OPEN: PAYCHECK PROTECTION PROGRAM
Great news: The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), in consultation with the U.S. Treasury Department, has opened the Paycheck Protection Program loan portal.  The opening of the SBA loan system is designed to efficiently and effectively implement the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits, and Venues Act and to ensure increased access to the PPP for minority-, underserved-, veteran- and women-owned small business concerns.
The portal is currently accepting First and Second Draw PPP loan applications from participating Community Financial Institutions (CFIs), which include Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs), Minority Depository Institutions (MDIs), Certified Development Companies (CDCs) and Microloan Intermediaries. More from the SBA, including necessary forms, can be found HERE.
	•	Eligible applicants for First Draw Loans that did not receive a PPP loan prior to August 8, 2020, but now have the ability to apply for a PPP First Draw Loan on or before March 31, 2021. First Draw PPP Loans can be used to help fund payroll costs, including benefits. Funds can also be used to pay for mortgage interest, rent, utilities, worker protection costs related to COVID-19, uninsured property damage costs caused by looting or vandalism during 2020, and certain supplier costs and expenses for operations  
	•	A Second Draw PPP loan is for certain eligible borrowers that previously received a PPP loan, generally have 300 employees or less, and have suffered a 25% reduction in gross receipts. At least $15 billion is set aside for additional PPP lending by CFIs. Eligible borrowers that previously received a PPP First Draw Loan may apply for a PPP Second Draw Loan of up to $2 million with the same general loan terms as their PPP First Draw Loans
Borrowers can apply for a First Draw PPP Loan until March 31, 2021, through any existing SBA 7(a) lender or through any federally insured depository institution, federally insured credit union, eligible non-bank lender, or Farm Credit System institution that is participating in PPP. All new First Draw PPP Loans will have the same terms regardless of lender or borrower. A list of participating lenders as well as additional information and full terms can be found HERE.
SBA also is calling upon its lending partners to redouble their efforts to assist eligible borrowers in underserved and disadvantaged communities. Additionally, SBA plans to dedicate specific times to process and assist the smallest PPP lenders with loan applications from eligible small businesses.
ECONOMIC IMPACT PAYMENTS
In January, the IRS sent a second round of Economic Impact Payments via direct deposit, paper checks, and EIP debit cards. The payment amounts are $600 per adult and $600 for eligible dependents. Americans should see direct deposit payments in their accounts already. Paper checks and debit cards should be delivered over the course of the next couple weeks.
Due to an IRS error, however, millions of direct deposit payments were sent to temporary or closed bank accounts used by third-party tax preparation companies to process tax refunds for certain taxpayers. The IRS initially indicated that people in this situation would have to wait to file their taxes to get their payments. But now a solution is being implemented to get payments to the majority of impacted Americans much quicker. Taxpayers do not need to take any additional action at this time and should continue to monitor their accounts for deposits. More details from the IRS can be found here.
These payments are an expansion of the Economic Impact Payments the IRS issued earlier in 2020 as part of the CARES Act.

PRESS RELEASE
For Immediate Release
February 3, 2021


Representative Adriano Espaillat Statement Following Biden Executive Orders Addressing Immigration


WASHINGTON, DC - Today, Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) released the following statement regarding executive orders issued by President Biden addressing immigration reform: 

""I commend President Biden and fully support his administration's efforts to reunite children with their parents who were torn apart by the Trump administration’s egregious Zero Tolerance Policy. I saw first hand the impact the previous administration's policies had on immigrant families and know that our country is safer, stronger, and more prosperous with a fair, safe, and orderly immigration system that welcomes immigrants, keeps families together, and allows people to more fully contribute to our country,"" said Rep. Espaillat.

""I am delighted the Biden-Harris administration included portions of my REUNITE Act, which I led with Vice President Harris during her time in the U.S. Senate, and I commend the President and Vice President on their efforts to address immigration reform, family reunification and immigrant protections. I look forward to working alongside this administration to return compassion to our immigration system and ensure that those who seek the American Dream have a chance to do so,"" Espaillat concluded.
 
Executive Order on Restoring Faith in Our Legal Immigration Systems and Strengthening Integration and Inclusion Efforts for New Americans:

Create a Task Force to Reunify Families. 

• President Biden believes that families belong together and will create a Family Reunification Task Force to reunite families who are still separated, an order similar to my REUNITE Act, which I led with Vice President Kamala Harris during her tenure in the U.S. Senate.

• President Biden has made clear that reversing the Trump Administration’s immigration policies that separated thousands of families at the border is a top priority, and a critical part of this effort is the creation of a task force to reunite families that remain separated.

• This task force will work across the U.S. government, with key stakeholders and representatives of impacted families, and with partners across the hemisphere to find parents and children separated by the Trump Administration.

Develop a Strategy to Address Irregular Migration Across the Southern Border and Create a Humane Asylum System

• The Trump Administration’s policies at the border have caused chaos, cruelty and confusion. Those policies have undermined the safety of our communities, penalized asylum seekers fleeing violence, and destabilized security across the Western hemisphere. 

• The Biden-Harris Administration will begin to roll back the most damaging policies adopted by the prior administration, while taking effective action to manage migration across the region.

Restore Faith in Our Legal Immigration System and Promote Integration of New Americans

• President Biden believes that immigrants are essential to who we are as a nation and critical to our aspirations for the future. As the prior administration enacted hundreds of policies that run counter to our history and undermine America’s character as a land of opportunity that is open and welcoming to all who come here seeking protection and opportunity. 

• President Biden's Executive Order elevates the role of the White House in coordinating the federal government’s strategy to promote immigrant integration and inclusion, including re-establishing a Task Force on New Americans, and ensuring that our legal immigration system operates fairly and efficiently.

Declaración del congresista Adriano Espaillat sobre las órdenes ejecutivas de Biden sobre inmigración


WASHINGTON, DC – Hoy, el congresista Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) emitió la siguiente declaración sobre las órdenes ejecutivas emitidas por el presidente Biden que abordan la reforma migratoria:

""Felicito al presidente Biden y apoyo plenamente los esfuerzos de su administración para reunir a los niños con sus padres, los cuales fueron destrozados por la atroz política de tolerancia cero de la administración Trump. Presencié de primera mano el impacto que las políticas de la administración anterior tuvieron en las familias inmigrantes y sé que nuestro país será más seguro, más fuerte y más próspero con un sistema de inmigración justo, seguro y ordenado que dé la bienvenida a los inmigrantes, mantenga unidas a las familias y permita que las personas contribuyan más plenamente a nuestro país"", dijo el Rep. Espaillat.

""Estoy encantado de que la administración Biden-Harris haya incluido partes de mi Ley REUNITE, que encabecé con la vicepresidenta Harris durante su tiempo en el Senado de los Estados Unidos, y felicito al presidente y a la vicepresidente por sus esfuerzos para abordar la reforma migratoria, la reunificación familiar y protecciones para los inmigrantes. Espero con entusiasmo trabajar junto a esta administración para devolver la compasión a nuestro sistema de inmigración y asegurar que aquellos que buscan el Sueño Americano tengan la oportunidad de alcanzarlo"", concluyó Espaillat.

La Orden ejecutiva sobre el Restablecimiento de la Fe en nuestro Sistema Legal de Inmigración y el Fortalecimiento de los Esfuerzos de Integración e Inclusión para los Nuevos Estadounidenses:

Crea un Grupo de Trabajo para Reunificar Familias.

• El presidente Biden cree que las familias deben estar juntas y creará un Grupo de Trabajo de Reunificación Familiar para reunir a las familias que aún están separadas, una orden similar a mi Ley REUNITE, que lideré con la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris durante su mandato en el Senado de los Estados Unidos.

• El presidente Biden ha dejado en claro que revertir las políticas de inmigración de la Administración Trump que separaron a miles de familias en la frontera es una prioridad máxima, y una parte fundamental de este esfuerzo es la creación de un grupo de trabajo para reunir a las familias que permanecen separadas.

• Este grupo de trabajo trabajará en todo el gobierno de los EE.UU., con partes interesadas clave y representantes de las familias afectadas, y con socios en todo el hemisferio para encontrar padres e hijos separados por la Administración Trump.

Desarrolla una Estrategia para Abordar la Migración Irregular a través de la Frontera Sur y Crea un Sistema de Asilo Humano
• Las políticas de la Administración Trump en la frontera han causado caos, crueldad y confusión. Esas políticas han socavado la seguridad de nuestras comunidades, han penalizado a los solicitantes de asilo que huyen de la violencia y han desestabilizado la seguridad en todo el hemisferio Occidental.  • La Administración Biden-Harris comenzará a revertir las políticas más dañinas adoptadas por la administración anterior, mientras toma medidas efectivas para manejar la migración en toda la región.  Restaura la Fe en Nuestro Sistema de Inmigración Legal y Promueve la Integración de Nuevos Estadounidenses
• El presidente Biden cree que los inmigrantes son esenciales para lo que somos como nación y fundamentales para nuestras aspiraciones para el futuro. Mientras la administración anterior promulgó cientos de políticas que van en contra de nuestra historia y socavan el carácter de Estados Unidos como una tierra de oportunidades que es abierta y acogedora para todos los que vienen aquí en busca de protección y oportunidades.  • La Orden Ejecutiva del presidente Biden eleva el papel de la Casa Blanca en la coordinación de la estrategia del gobierno federal para promover la integración e inclusión de inmigrantes, incluido el restablecimiento de un Grupo de Trabajo sobre Nuevos Estadounidenses, y garantizar que nuestro sistema de inmigración legal funcione de manera justa y eficiente.

Congressional Report
 
 
Dear Friend,  Now is not the time to let our guard down with the virus. If we want to build back our economy, we must remain keen on doing our part and keeping one another safe. We will economically recover from this pandemic and save countless lives in the process. Until the vaccine is available to everyone, please remember to wear a mask and social distance. 
 
 
 
In Congress, I am fighting each day to ensure that we continue providing the American public with increased access to testing and vaccines. Your safety and health is my top priority. 
 
 
 
As always, if you need assistance with a federal agency, reach out to my office. 
 
 
 
I also urge you to follow me on social media, @repcuellar, to stay up-to-date on new developments in Washington, DC and the district.


 
 
Update on Border Wall Construction
 
￼
  
In compliance with President Biden's executive orders, I received notification from U.S. Customs and Border Protection that all border wall construction as well as negotiations for border wall land have been halted. This means that all CBP contractors have now been formally notified by CBP Procurement to pause construction activities on CBP self-executed projects; additionallly, real estate acquisition activities such as surveys and negotiations with landowners have been placed on hold in coordination with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
 
 
This is a promising step in our work to halt construction of the ineffective and wasteful border wall and undo the damage that borderlands have experienced these past four years. However, our work continues. I remain steadfast in my commitment to working with the new administration until every border wall contract is terminated and all construction crews leave our border communities.
 

 
 
Calling for a Pathway to Citizenship
 
￼
  
An estimated five million immigrants, including 202,500 DACA recipients and 131,300 TPS holders, have stepped up to serve our country in a time of crisis by working on the frontlines of the COVID-19 pandemic. I joined my colleagues on a letter calling for the inclusion of of immigrant essential workers, Dreamers and TPS holders in the COVID-19 reconciliation recovery bill. Not only have these individuals helped keep us safe and healthy, but they will be critical in our economic recovery. It is time that they be able to apply for U.S. citizenship.
 
 
 
Pictured is a portion of the letter to Speaker Pelosi and Chairman Yarmuth.
 
 

 
 
City of Palmview Food Distribution
 
￼
  
On Saturday, January 30th, my Outreach Coordinator, Nicolas Cruz, attended the City of Palmview food distribution. To help supply the event, Iglesia Del Pueblo and the North Bridge Foundation donated over one thousand packages of food to the city. While there, Nicolas was able to assist in distributing these packages to families in need. 
 
 
Pictured is the City of Palmview distribution event.
 

 
 
Hidalgo County Water Control and Improvement District 19
 
￼
  
On Wednesday, January 27th, Nicolas attended the Hidalgo County Water Control and Improvement District 19 Border Levee Tour. During the tour, the general manager of HCWCID, Oscar Gonzalez, showed the environmental damages inflicted by border wall construction. Now that construction has halted, my office is monitoring the situation closely to ensure that border communities are able to recover. 
 
 
Pictured is part of the HCWCID tour.
 

 
 
City of Laredo's State of the City Address
 
 
￼
 
  
Also on Wednesday, my Outreach Coordinator for La Salle, Webb, McMullen and Zapata Counties, Orlando Ramirez, attended the virtual 2021 State of the City Address. Mayor Pete Saenz provided an update on major accomplishments from the past year as well as shared with the public the city's plan for the future.

On Sunday, January 24th, my Constituent Services Representative/Outreach Coordinator in my San Antonio office, Kendall Hayes, presented a Certificate of Recognition to Mrs. Kitchen Soul Food. Cheryl Thompson and her family celebrated the grand opening of their establishment. Next time I’m in Windcrest, I look forward to stopping by!

￼
  
The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children - or better known as WIC - serves low-income pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding women, infants, and children up to age 5 who are at nutritional risk by providing nutritious foods to supplement diets, information on healthy eating including breastfeeding promotion and support, and referrals to health care.

2/3/21 12:20,YouTube Censored Me,"￼
Mission: To Help People

YouTube Cancels the U.S. Senate 
￼ Google's YouTube has ratcheted up censorship to a new level by removing two videos from my channel of a U.S. Senate committee. They were from my December 8 Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs hearing on early treatment of Covid-19. One was a 30-minute summary; the other was the opening statement of critical-care specialist Pierre Kory.
Dr. Kory is from Milwaukee but part of a world-renowned group of physicians who developed a groundbreaking use of corticosteroids to treat hospitalized Covid patients. His testimony at a May Senate hearing helped doctors rethink treatment protocols and saved lives.
The censors at YouTube have decided for all of us that the American public shouldn't be able to hear what senators heard. Apparently they are smarter than medical doctors who have devoted their lives to science and use their skills to save lives. They have decided there is only one medical viewpoint allowed, and it is the viewpoint dictated by government agencies. Government-sanctioned censorship of ideas and speech should frighten us all.
Read my full piece on this Big Tech censorship in the Wall Street Journal: YouTube Cancels the U.S. Senate 
Note: YouTube gave us 5 hours warning before deleting Dr. Kory's testimony from my YouTube channel. A few days later the video of that same testimony was also taken down from Fox News Now's YouTube channel, where it had nearly 8 million views. We've seen the video on other YouTube channels like Bloomberg and PBS. The question remains, why selectively delete Dr. Kory's testimony?

Family Watches Dr. Kory's Video, Sues to Save Mother
￼
Watch this remarkable video about a family in Buffalo, New York who watched the video of Dr. Pierre Kory's testimony about using ivermectin to treat Covid-19. When their 80-year old mother became critically ill with Covid in January, they went to court to get the hosptial to try Dr. Kory's protocol.
Rebuttal to Milwaukee Journal Sentinel 
￼ 
I wanted to make sure you saw the op-ed that I submitted to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel rebutting their charges that I am in anyway responsible for inflaming tensions that led to the violence at the U.S. Capitol January 6.
I hope you will read this op-ed for a better understanding of the actions I took than what you'll get from biased mainstream media outlets like the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel who refused to publish this rebuttal without more biased editorial commentary.
Here is the op-ed I submitted rebutting two Journal Sentinel opinoin pieces.
Here is what the newspaper eventually published. You will see the Journal Sentinel added 19 footnotes which are longer than the 1,000 words I was given for my rebuttal.
Getting Answers About Captiol Breach 
￼
The American people deserve answers about the Capitol security breach. An independent investigation must occur, but until it does, I've sent letters to former and now-acting sergeants at arms of the House and Senate asking for answers.

￼

February 3, 2021

Dear Lindsey,

Thank you so much for subscribing to my email updates. If you haven't already, I hope you'll take a moment to find me on Facebook and follow me on Twitter as well.

I wanted to take this opportunity to tell you about the first two bills I introduced in Congress: The PAUSE Act and the POWER Act.

The PAUSE from COVID-19 Act

My first bill, the Protecting Americans from Unnecessary Spread upon Entry (PAUSE) from COVID-19 Act, would ensure border health protections put in place by the Trump administration remain in place. It would be foolish and unfair to open our borders to those who may have COVID-19 or other transmissible diseases while our schools, businesses, and communities remain locked down.

The PAUSE Act would prevent the Biden administration from taking away the Border Patrol's ability to deny entry or quickly expel illegal immigrants who may introduce new cases or new strains of the virus until all COVID-19 lockdowns, stay-at-home orders, and public health emergencies end. More than 30 of my colleagues have already signed on to this important legislation, which was also endorsed by NumbersUSA, FAIR, and Heritage Action.

￼

Biden's Dangerous Border Policy

On Saturday I talked with Fox News about President Biden's possibly illegal decision to halt border wall construction and my legislation to keep border health protections in place. 

📺 CLICK HERE WATCH 

The POWER Act

My second bill, the Protecting Our Wealth of Energy Resources (POWER) Act, would prevent the Biden administration from any further suspension of oil and gas leasing on federal lands without the approval of Congress. In New Mexico, more than half the oil and more than two-thirds of the natural gas production occurs on land leased from the federal government.

Banning future energy development, as President Biden has promised to do, would be catastrophic for our state. More than a third of our state's budget comes from royalty payments and taxes on the oil and gas industry — including more than $1 billion a year in funding for public education. I'm proud to have the support of Republican leaders and senators in this effort to protect more than 60,000 good-paying jobs in New Mexico.


Protecting New Mexico's Jobs

The oil and gas industry in New Mexico supports more than 117,000 jobs while fewer than 5,050 work in wind and solar combined. I talked about my efforts to protect our state's economy and education funding. 

📺 CLICK HERE TO WATCH 
￼

Other Legislation 

In addition to the legislation I've introduced, I've also cosponsored a number of other important bills introduced by my colleagues. These include bills to establish term limits for Congress, audit the Federal Reserve, and more than a dozen bills to protect the sanctity of human life.

I am honored to represent you in Washington and it's important that I hear from you about the issues you care most about. You can email me through my website anytime. I look forward to hearing from you!

Sincerely,

2/3/21 13:25,Poll: Keystone XL Pipeline Shutdown,"
￼
￼
￼

Dear Hoosiers,

Over the last two weeks, the Biden Administration has made a series of executive actions focusing on a variety of agenda priorities, including investment in green energy. Recently, President Biden announced the cancellation of the Keystone XL Pipeline (KXL), a massive oil pipeline running from Canada into the United States. 

Many who oppose the construction, development, and implementation of the 1,200-mile pipeline cite concerns with traditional energy sources. The pipeline carries fossil fuel produced in Canada, and critics of the pipeline argue it is in contravention to their aim of reducing reliance on fossil fuels and promoting green energy. Fossil fuels have also long been criticized for their threats to the environment and public health. 

Yet, to this day, petroleum oil is still the largest US energy source, and the US has made significant strides over the last twenty years in reducing per capita and per GDP dollar emissions. Additionally, supporters argue that the pipeline doesn’t eliminate fossil fuel production; it just means it will be re-routed to China through the Canadian west coast ports.  

Proponents of the KXL note that transporting oil cross-country through pipelines is one of the safest and cleanest means of energy transportation. They also cite the continued need for domestic oil resources, which would not only limit our dependence on the Middle East and other foreign sources for oil but create thousands of jobs. According to the Distribution Contractors Association (DCA), the pipeline would have created 10,000 American jobs and more than $2.2 billion in wages. Additionally, now that the project construction has halted, after 300 miles have already been built, over 600 jobs related to the project have to be cut. 


QUESTION OF THE WEEK: Do you agree with the Biden Administration’s executive action to shut down the Keystone XL pipeline? 

[_] Yes, I support termination of the project 
[_] No, I believe the project should continue 
[_] I don’t know

Dear Friend,
Our national debt is now above $27 trillion and is continuing to rise. To ensure that our nation is responsible and to avert a fiscal crisis, Congress must stop budgeting crisis to crisis.
Today, I helped introduce a resolution that proposes a new constitutional amendment to balance our nation's budget.
Families in Nebraska and across the country have to make difficult decisions every day about their finances. It is far past time for Congress to do the same. 
￼ 

	•	Prohibit total outlays from exceeding total receipts, unless two-thirds of members in both chambers provide by law for the specific excess.
	•	Prohibit federal spending from exceeding 18% of gross domestic product (GDP) unless two-thirds of members in both chambers provide by law for the specific excess.
	•	Require the president to submit a budget each year that meets the aforementioned criteria.
	•	Require two-thirds majority votes in the House and Senate for any bill to raise taxes.
	•	Require a new three-fifths majority vote in Congress to raise the debt limit.
Introducing this bill is just the first step. We have a lot of work to do in Congress to become more fiscally responsible.
As we begin the 117th Congress, stay up-to-date by following my office on Facebook and Twitter.

Dear Friend, 
Black History Month allows us to reflect on the richness and diversity of Black achievements and contributions and the role of Black Americans in shaping our nation’s history. 
At the end of last year, Virginia took the long-overdue step of removing a statue of Confederate general Robert E. Lee that had long represented the Commonwealth in our nation’s Capitol, and replaced it with one of Barbara Johns, the 16-year-old from Moton High School in Farmville who led a student walkout with her Black classmates to protest school segregation in Virginia in 1951.   This month likewise offers as an opportunity to recognize all those who led the fight for equality while also taking the time to reflect on some of the darkest aspects of our country’s history, and the work that lies ahead of us in righting our nation’s wrongs. 
Last year, the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks, Ahmaud Arbery, and other Black Americans served as painful reminders of the racial violence, institutional racism, and discrimination that so many Black Americans continue to face on a daily basis. These deaths rightfully prompted widespread calls for justice, and overdue conversations about racism, discrimination, injustice, and the need for bold action. 
That’s why I want to take this opportunity to highlight a sweeping police reform bill I was proud to introduce alongside my colleagues Cory Booker and then-Senator Kamala Harris. This legislation, called the Justice in Policing Act, seeks to end racial profiling and qualified immunity, address police brutality, and change law enforcement culture by increasing accountability and transparency and improving police practices and training. I will continue working with my colleagues to address injustice through action as we affirm that Black Lives Matter – today, tomorrow, and long after Black History Month is over. 
If you want to share your thoughts about an issue that’s important to you, you can send me an email any time using the form on my Senate website. You can also follow me on Facebook and Twitter. I look forward to hearing from you. 
Sincerely,

Biden Targets Oil & Gas Workers
 
 
Houston is the energy capitol of America, and we are proud of our companies and hard-working Americans. But it seems like each week, President Biden is launching a new attack on our nation’s oil and gas workers. After killing the Keystone XL pipeline, President Biden went one step further in banning new oil and gas leasing on federal lands. 
 
We cannot let this happen, and I will fight for Texas workers and oppose these actions – as well as any others that hurt American workers and energy independence. 
 
That’s why I hosted Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, members of the House Republican Conference, and Texas oil and gas leaders on the Houston Ship Channel for an energy roundtable. There, we heard first-hand how devastating these radical policies are to American workers and companies – and called upon President Biden to reverse his job-killing actions.
 
￼
Click here or above to watch my remarks.
 
“Millions of Americans are jobless, thanks to the pandemic. 
 
“President Biden’s top priority, while defeating the virus, is getting Americans back to work. 
 
“So it’s troubling that in his first week in office he deliberately killed more than a million good-paying jobs in America. Many of them blue-collar, many of them union, many of them here in Texas. 
 
“His attack on traditional American energy workers may be cheered by the Green New Deal crowd – and Russia, China & the Middle East - but it’s devastating to our workers, families and local businesses here in Houston.
 
￼

“So, Mr. President, I invite you, challenge you to come here to Houston. Meet face-to-face with the workers whose jobs you ended, meet with their families and their companies – who face even more layoffs thanks to you. 
 
“Tell them why their jobs don’t matter to you, why their families don’t matter. 
 
“And tell them where they can apply – now – for all those good-paying jobs you’ve promised will replace them. Because they have bills now, they have kids heading to college now. 
 
“Mr. President, you pledged at your Inauguration to do your very best for all of America, not just those who supported you. Reversing your job-killing actions would be a good place to start.”

Hi there, 
 As the Biden-Harris administration geared up in DC, we had a busy first district week of the year! I am looking forward to tackling the many challenges facing our community with the new administration, including beating this virus, ensuring justice and equity, and putting the American people first.  Here’s how I spent this past week working for you:  The COVID-19 vaccine is top of mind! In every conversation I had last week, whether at the opening of the new Delco Wellness Center, in zoom meetings, or in a trip to the grocery store, people wanted to talk about the new COVID19 vaccines — where to get them, when they will be available, and what the side effects are. In the first weeks of vaccine distribution, we have seen the negative impact of inadequate planning and the lack of a national strategy for rolling out the vaccine. Last week, Dr. Fauci briefed members of Congress on efforts by the Biden administration to correct inaccurate vaccine predictions by the last administration, ramp up production, and make distribution more fair and predictable.  With that in mind, we will be holding a COVID19 teletown hall regarding vaccines and distribution so that you can ask all of your questions for medical professionals and local officials on Thursday, February 18, at 8 pm. Stay tuned to our social media for further details.  In the meantime, here are some local resources: We are currently in Phase 1A of vaccine distribution. People who live or work in Delco can now pre-register for the COVID-19 vaccine by completing a form found on the Chester County Health Department’s COVID-19 website: chesco.seamlessdocs.com/f/delcovac.  Delco has also established a vaccine call center to answer your questions. You can reach them at:  - Phone: (484) 276–2100  - Email: Covid19Resources@co.delaware.pa.us  For residents who live in Montgomery County & Philadelphia, here are the links for information on the COVID-19 vaccine  - MontCo: montcopa.org  - Philly: covid-vaccine-interest.phila.gov  Introduced a resolution recognizing January as National Mentoring Month There are currently 9 million young people in the United States feeling isolated from meaningful connections with adults outside their homes, resulting in a ‘‘mentoring gap.” Mentors provide youth with the support, encouragement, and guidance they need to succeed through academic and personal challenges.  We all need someone in our corner, but too many young people are making choices and decisions every day without the support of an adult. That’s why I’m proud to join Rep. Jamie Herrera Beutler (WA-03) in recognizing January as National Mentoring Month to celebrate the powerful impact of mentoring relationships and to raise awareness about the increased need for caring adults to become mentors in our communities.  Read more here: https://link.medium.com/xcqQJTeGrdb  Submitted PA5 vaccine concerns to President Biden and Acting Secretary of Health Cochran The previous administration’s scattershot pandemic response left the most at-risk Americans competing against each other for this vaccine. We need to move immediately to correct this situation.  I requested that, in determining vaccine allocation to states and localities, their administration weigh vaccine allotments with attention to the number of vulnerable individuals within these jurisdictions and not simply by total population. That way, communities like ours, with a larger than average share of healthcare workers, and minority and elderly Americans are not left competing against one another for a scarce resource they all should have priority in accessing.  Read more here: https://link.medium.com/ZZpsn3gHrdb  Hosted our first town hall of 2021! Thank you to everyone who joined us for our first tele-town hall of 2021.  Read about the town hall here: https://www.penncapital-star.com/government-politics/pa-rep-scanlon-takes-questions-on-covid-capitol-riot-and-schools-during-town-hall/  Celebrated the 100th birthday of Otis Evans, a WWII Navy veteran from our district It was an honor to be able to join Mr. Evans' family alongside local police and fire departments outside of his nursing home to wish him a happy birthday and thank him for his service! It was my pleasure to be able to deliver to him a flag flown over the Capitol.  Check out the celebration here: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Syw4SC7fBqA&feature=youtu.be  Stopped by the opening of the new Delco Wellness Center This pandemic has rocked our community to the core. The new Delaware County Wellness Center will serve as a public health anchor in our community and be a vital resource in combating this virus.  Read more here: https://whyy.org/articles/delco-debuts-wellness-center-as-covid-19-vaccination-effort-intensifies/  Continued work with local agencies to address hunger in our communities The economic disruption caused by the pandemic has forced many families to rely upon public and private food distribution efforts to keep hunger at bay. We work closely with food pantries and agencies to support their efforts and keep abreast of community need as we craft and troubleshoot relief legislation. This past week, we sponsored a food drive with Delaware County in Glen Mills and helped distribute food to families at Upper Darby Township, and to idled restaurant workers at Le Virtu restaurant in South Philadelphia.  Read more here: https://www.inquirer.com/food/servebetter-food-giveaway-for-restaurant-workers-20210121.html?utm_medium=referral&utm_source=ios&utm_campaign=app_ios_article_share&utm_content=ZLYV3LXNGFAFFM5R7NKUNQ6LXI  Groundhog Day Fun I had the opportunity to join the annual Groundhog Festival at John Heinz Wildlife Refuge, where young visitors participated in a wildlife scavenger hunt and a storybook walk on a bright and brisk winter day. Parents also enjoyed the opportunity for their children to expend some energy outside in a socially distanced way.  Watch a short video from the festival here: https://fb.watch/3pvne8MrTm/    I continue to meet with our local public health and community leaders each week as we work together to map our path out of this pandemic and towards recovery. Thank you for everything you’re doing to keep your friends, family, and neighbors safe. Keep social distancing. Keep wearing your mask, And wash your hands frequently. We know that these are challenging times, but we can support each other to come through stronger.  Our office is here to help as we navigate this crisis together. You can reach us by phone at 610- 626–2020 or by sending me a message through our website at scanlon.house.gov/contact.  Sincerely,  Mary Gay

2/3/21 16:22,NEW: COVID-19 Vaccination Site Coming to Cal State LA,"￼ ￼ ￼ 
￼
  
Dear Friends,  Today, the White House and Governor Newsom announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will be opening a COVID-19 vaccination site right here in California's 34th District at California State University, Los Angeles on February 16.
 
This is critical for our community, which has been ravaged by this virus, and a direct result of President Biden taking immediate action to tackle this public health crisis by establishing 100 vaccination sites in his first 100 days.
 
As vaccine rollout continues, it is vital that the State of California execute an equitable vaccination plan that prioritizes frontline workers and vulnerable Black and Brown communities.
 
This vaccination site will be staffed and resourced by FEMA. As more details become available, I will be sharing vaccine resources on my social media accounts.

2/3/21 16:31,Is there any depravity too low?,"￼

Dear Neighbor,
 
Last month, during my speech on the House floor in support of impeaching Donald Trump for a second time, I asked my colleagues on the other side of the aisle a few basic questions:
 
Is there any depravity too low? Is there any outrage too far? Is there any amount of blood and violence that will change the hearts and minds of Donald Trump's most extreme enablers in Congress?
 
I had hoped that the insurrection at the US Capitol, incited by President Trump and inspired by his 'Big Lie' about a stolen election, would force the House minority to embark on some long-overdue self-reflection. Instead, the country watches in horror as they warmly welcome into their conference a bigoted and unhinged freshman member of Congress: Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA).
 
Even aside from her blind adherence to the QAnon conspiracy theory and her support for the Big Lie that led to the Capitol attack, Rep. Greene boasts a record of appalling behavior far too extensive to include in full here. But there are several particularly egregious episodes I'd like to point out.
 
As you read this list, keep in mind that these are the words and actions of an elected member of Congress who has just been named to the Committee on Education and Labor by her colleagues:
  
  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (QAnon - Ga.)  

 
She's claimed that tragic mass shootings, including in Las Vegas and Parkland, FL, were ""staged"" events. 
 
There is video of her harassing and verbally assaulting a young survivor of the Parkland shooting. She calls him a coward and warns him, a recent victim of gun violence, that she has a gun on her.
 
 
She's repeatedly endorsed executing Democrats, including Speaker Pelosi, and has said the “only way you get your freedoms back is it’s earned with the price of blood.”
 
According to the Washington Post, ""In February 2019, she led a group of Trump supporters into the speaker’s office, where she accused Pelosi of “treason” and suggested she “shall suffer death or shall be imprisoned.”'
 
She's claimed that the 2018 California wildfires were caused by a laser beam powered by ""solar generators"" in space controlled by a Jewish family.
 
She's claimed that the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon was faked because there is ""never any evidence shown for a plane in the Pentagon.”
 
Media Matters uncovered social media posts in which she ""endorsed a conspiracy theory that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was videotaped murdering a child during a satanic ritual and then ordered a hit on a police officer to cover it up.""
 

 
Over the years, I've witnessed all manner of quackery from some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. But I had never encountered anyone as fundamentally unmoored from reality as Marjorie Taylor Greene. Her presence in the House of Representatives is a stain that will only darken with each moment she is allowed to walk the halls of Congress.
 
I firmly believe Rep. Greene's conduct warrants her immediate expulsion from the House, and I am a cosponsor of Rep. Jimmy Gomez's (D-CA) resolution that would do just that. In the meantime, it is our moral imperative to strip Rep. Greene of her committee assignments, particularly her outrageous placement on the Education and Labor Committee. Her despicable behavior must not be rewarded with the power and platform a congressional committee can provide. 
 
I'll end with the question again for my colleagues in the minority, and I pray they'll soon be ready to answer:
 
Is there any depravity too low?
 
Sincerely,
￼
  
Gerald E. Connolly
Member of Congress

My Work on Improving Illinois’ COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution
This week, I sent a letter alongside Rep. Bill Foster (IL-11) to the White House Coordinator of the COVID-19 Response, Jeffrey Zients, asking for an explanation for the unequal distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to different states. Both Congressman Foster and I serve on the Select Subcommittee On The Coronavirus Crisis and are particularly concerned with differences in the per capita quantities of vaccine doses provided to different states. The most troubling aspect of this issue is the fact that Illinois now ranks 42nd in the nation for vaccine distribution per capita. I’m hopeful that the White House will respond to our inquiry quickly and with a proper plan to adequately distribute vaccine doses to our state and across the country.
It is imperative that we continue to drive down the COVID-19 infection rate while increasing the number of vaccine doses we are administering each week. On Tuesday, I was interviewed on Chicago Tonight to discuss updates on COVID-19 and getting more relief to families in Illinois, including vaccine funding.

My Investigation into $70 Million Contract for Faulty Ventilators
Last week, I opened an investigation into the Trump Administration’s $70 million purchase of faulty ventilators for COVID-19 patients. The ventilators purchased in this deal from the company AutoMedx had been the subject of reports indicating their inability to treat COVID-19 patients, even though that was the purpose for which they were purchased. As I told the Washington Post, the federal government’s performance specifications for ventilator products sufficient to treat COVID-19 patients – which were created with input from AutoMedx’s co-founder – were almost identical to the specifications of AutoMedx’s ventilator product. The American public deserves to know whether their tax dollars were spent productively or with ulterior motives in this deal. I am determined to see this investigation through and uncover whether the federal government’s $70 million ventilator contract was waste, negligence, or fraud and abuse.
The Importance of Public Service In My Life
As we continue into the first couple months of a new year, it was nice to take a stroll down memory lane with this Roll Call article on my path toward a career in public service. I remember fondly my time working on former President Obama’s early campaigns in Illinois and how it inspired me to run for office. To all the young people out there, I hope you find a similar passion for your career, and I highly recommend dedicating yourself to public service.

WEEKLY RECAP
The latest news and updates from Congresswoman Beth Van Duyne

February 3, 2021

Dear Friend,
 
I have some exciting news to share with you. This past week, I was chosen to serve on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. As a former mayor engaged in numerous transportation projects and committees, I understand prioritizing infrastructure development and revamping our nation’s transportation systems are critical to spurring economic growth and uplifting working families. I’m looking forward to leaning on my experience and my strong relationships across the region to champion North Texas’ priorities. North Texas is one of the fastest growing areas in the country, which is why it’s imperative that we work to expand our region’s transportation and water needs with an eye towards the future.  

In addition to being appointed to the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I was selected to serve on the House Small Business Committee. I’ve spent the majority of my career working hand-in-hand with thousands of small businesses across the North Texas region. They are the heartbeat of our communities and have suffered, through no fault of their own, as a result of this pandemic. I know many small business owners have invested their life savings to keep their doors open, and I’m committed to advancing policies in Congress that ensure their investments remain worthwhile.

Transportation Roundtable Discussion

On Thursday I had the privilege of hosting a roundtable discussion with key stakeholders in the transportation industry across North Texas. As a new member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I was eager to sit down with companies in North Texas to hear about the challenges they’re facing. 

During the roundtable, representatives including elected officials, transportation experts, and key stakeholders were able to offer their perspectives on the challenges facing infrastructure revitalization and their hopes for the future of transportation. The coronavirus pandemic has impacted every aspect of our country and many stakeholders discussed how their organizations were adapting to changes. The common sentiment is that leaders need to focus on policy over politics. I want to spend my time in Congress getting things done 
￼
￼

Franchisee Roundtable Discussion

On Friday I hosted a small business roundtable with small business and local franchise owners in North Texas to discuss their concerns about the economy, how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed how their businesses operate, and how they have made adjustments and continued to thrive. 
￼

I was honored to present the first Lone Star 24 Business Award to Mark Glenn of Fast Signs to recognize him and his entire team at Fast Signs for their generous donation of 15,000 face shields to the Dallas Police Department early in the pandemic when Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) supplies were at their lowest. 
￼

This discussion will be the first of many small business roundtables I plan on hosting throughout the district. Small businesses interested in joining for future roundtable discussions can contact Cody Vaden at cody.vaden@mail.house.gov.

Standing for Life

Millions of pro-life Americans gathered virtually and in-person last Friday to celebrate the sanctity of life. I join them in reaffirming my commitment to be a voice for the unborn and to champion policies to defend our most vulnerable. In recent years, the Left and the mainstream media has increasingly tried to paint the pro-life movement as an anti-women movement. But this year, we have witnessed a historic number of strong, vocal, and pro-life women elected to Congress. I look forward to standing together with my colleagues to dispel that myth and fight for life.

Earlier in the week, I joined 199 of my House Republican colleagues in sending a letter to House and Senate Leadership pledging to oppose legislation that weakens or opposes the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits taxpayer dollars from funding abortions. 

I also visited the Birth Choice Crisis Pregnancy Center where I heard about the services the center provides to families across North Texas. They are committed to helping young mothers in our community with counseling, financial assistance, and necessary supplies for pregnancy and motherhood. To learn more about the Center, click here.

2/3/21 22:26,A Note From Jeff About the New Congress," ￼ 
A Note From Jeff About the New Congress 
There’s no doubt about it -- this is a dark winter. More than 400,000 Americans have lost their lives to this pandemic over the last twelve months. Another twenty million have been sickened, and while many have been fortunate enough to recover, tens of thousands are still fighting for their lives. Businesses have shuttered, and millions of hardworking Americans have lost their livelihoods.   But amid this darkness, we have the power to turn this new year and Congress into a harbinger of hope -- to turn the page and deliver the resources to help our families weather this storm, frontline health workers do their jobs and stay safe, and Main Street businesses stay afloat. That’s why I will continue to do everything I can to ensure that the upcoming coronavirus relief package will bring this round of stimulus payments up to $2000, for both adults and children; robust funding for rapid vaccine distribution; a moratorium on utility shut-offs; loans for our businesses; resources to help our schools reopen safely and to help states, localities, and tribes avoid layoffs to educators, first responders, and health staff; and personal protective equipment for our dedicated health care heroes and essential workers.   While addressing the pandemic must remain our top priority, Congress must also simultaneously address the other urgent crises that are knocking on our door -- attacks on the very heart of our democratic republic, the threat of climate chaos, and the lack of opportunity for working families across the country.    That’s why I’m going to keep up the fight to pass the For the People Act to put the power back in the hands of the American people; bills like the Good Jobs for 21st Century Energy Act that will help us harness the climate challenge as an opportunity to build a green economy made up of reliable, good-paying jobs; and the innovative policies we need to put affordable housing, good-paying jobs, quality health care, and a well-rounded education within reach for Oregonians in every corner of our state.   Serving the people of Oregon -- particularly during this tumultuous and challenging time -- is the honor of my lifetime. I am determined to do all that I can to ensure that our ‘We the People’ government is restored, and that it works for all of you, not the powerful special interests, and delivers the action and support our families need to survive this pandemic and to thrive in the chapters ahead.   All my best,  Jeff 
 
Working with the Biden Administration to Deliver for You 
President Joe Biden earned a powerful mandate from the American people to deliver on everything from coronavirus relief, health care, and jobs, to immigration reform, climate action, and the student loan debt crisis. Before any of that can happen, Congress must confirm his nominees to lead the federal agencies. 

Throughout January, Jeff carefully reviewed the credentials of, and met with, a number of President Biden’s cabinet Secretary nominees, including Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency nominee Michael Regan and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations nominee Linda Thomas-Greenfield, and now-confirmed Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas. Jeff remains committed to thoroughly considering each of President Biden’s nominees, and will continue to urge them to use their departments to put the interest of working Americans ahead of the wish lists of the powerful and privileged.
 
Helping Oregon’s Rural Communities Fund Vital Services 
The coronavirus crisis has squeezed resources in every part of Oregon, but some of the very hardest hit communities have been rural ones with fewer resources to begin with. That’s why Jeff joined a bipartisan group of senators in pushing to ensure that the bills that will fund the government throughout 2021 included a reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) and Payment in Lieu of Taxes (PILT) programs.   The $515 million Jeff and his colleagues secured for PILT helps Oregon counties that have large tracts of federal land, which doesn’t pay property taxes, cover costs associated with public safety, social services, transportation, and housing. In addition, Oregon’s rural school districts continue to receive SRS funding through 2021 from Senator Merkley’s efforts in passing legislation in 2019.   Jeff also used his seat as the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations subcommittee funding the U.S. Department of Agriculture to fight for a number of the department’s Rural Development programs, including rural housing and business development programs.  He is the only member of Oregon’s congressional delegation who directs federal spending by serving on an appropriations committee. 
 
Supporting Americans’ Mental Health During the Pandemic 
""The challenges of this pandemic have further emphasized what so many of us, our friends, and our family members have long known: Mental health care is essential care,"" Jeff said last month, as he announced that Tribal organizations in Oregon and the state Health Authority will receive $4.66 million in federal funding to support mental health and substance abuse treatment. ""I’m grateful that this funding is headed to tribal communities to help strengthen and boost accessibility to mental health services, and will continue to work to ensure that tribal members receive the resources and support they need to be healthy during this difficult time.""   The Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians and the Native American Rehabilitation Association of the Northwest will each receive $1.08 million, the Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Indians will receive $500,000, and the Oregon Health Authority will receive $2 million in funding.    Please visit the CDC mental health resources page for more information and recommendations about how to best care for your mental health during this crisis. 
 
Addressing Oregon’s Housing Crisis 
As Oregon continues to grapple with a severe shortage of affordable housing -- a crisis that has only deepened since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic -- Jeff worked to ensure that the federal spending bills that passed in December would fund programs and resources Oregonians need to keep roofs over their heads.    Those resources include $1.41 billion for rental assistance in rural communities, $40 million for Rural Housing Service Vouchers, and $3.5 billion in federal funding for Community Development Block Grants, which fund vital housing rehabilitation projects. Jeff also led 37 of his colleagues in a successful effort to provide an additional $895 million to support continuing rental assistance for 1.2 million low-income households, and helped ensure that critical housing programs that support the elderly and people with disabilities were also preserved.

Thom’s Results
Meet Thom
How Can I Help?
Friends, 
One of my top priorities as your U.S. Senator is ensuring the safety and well-being of you and your family, especially during this unprecedented time. As we entered into the new year, I got right to work introducing legislation that puts your needs at the forefront.  
COVID-19 Relief Compromise 
I am working hard to bring relief to North Carolinians as we continue to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. I joined nine of my Republican colleagues to outline a new COVID-19 relief proposal that we hope will gain wide bipartisan support. The plan includes relief for vaccine distribution and testing as well as help for schools, small businesses, and individuals. This week, I met with President Biden and Vice President Harris to discuss the plan. It was an excellent meeting, and we are very appreciative that in his first official meeting in the Oval Office, President Biden chose to spend so much time with us discussing the response to the COVID-19 crisis. We are hopeful that a COVID-19 relief bill will be agreed upon soon.
Committed to Protecting the Unborn 
During this year’s annual March for Life, I reaffirmed my commitment to protecting our most vulnerable by co-sponsoring 12 different pro-life bills. As the Left continues to increase its attacks on the pro-life movement and the unborn, we must vigorously renew our efforts to defend the sanctity of life. Each of us has a duty to protect the most vulnerable among us, including those who are not yet born, and I will continue advocating for these innocent, unborn lives.   Stopping Sanctuary Cities 
In light of President Biden’s immigration orders, I reintroduced two bills: the Immigration Detainer Enforcement Act and Justice for Victims of Sanctuary Cities Act. Both bills are commonsense legislation that will enhance public safety and hold sanctuary jurisdictions accountable for their refusal to cooperate with federal law enforcement, putting dangerous illegal criminals back into our communities.
I will continue to fight against reckless policies that would put the safety of our communities in jeopardy and will never stop working for the health, safety, and well-being of every North Carolinian.  
Thank you for reading, and as always, please reach out to my office if you have any questions or need help with a federal agency. God bless.

Matt's Weekly Memo
 
  
Dear Lindsey,
 
Last week, I announced that five first responder agencies in Northeastern Pennsylvania will receive nearly $57,000 to buy more personal protective equipment (PPE) and essential supplies.
 
I often think of the men and women who serve in our fire companies and their families as I continue to push for more support for our safety infrastructure and local governments during this crisis. I consider it my duty to fight for them and ensure our first responders have what they need to keep themselves and our communities safe. 
  
 
Protecting Workers
 
  
Northeastern Pennsylvania's working class tradition is a longstanding one, going back to our coal-mining forbears. Putting workers first has always been a priority of mine, and I believe these efforts are more important than ever amid COVID-19. Over the past few weeks, I'm proud that the federal government is taking steps I have been calling for to strengthen workplace safety standards, especially those in frontline industries whose workers never stopped clocking in since the pandemic began. This includes people who are still mining coal for a living. That's why I reintroduced the COVID-19 Mine Worker Protection Act this week.
 
This is a bill supported by both Democrats and Republicans that would implement responsible safety guidance and deliver personal protective equipment so that miners can continue to work, stay healthy and provide for their families during this health crisis.
  
 
Supporting a Fair Wage
 
  
It's been more than a decade since we've raised the federal minimum wage, and as a result, there is not one place in America where a full-time worker making $7.25 per hour can afford rent, food and other essentials.
 
That's why I am co-sponsoring the Raise the Wage Act to gradually raise the federal minimum wage to $15 by 2025.
 
This will make a real impact in Northeastern Pennsylvanians' lives. Raising the wage will help 101,000 workers in the Eighth Congressional District -- boosting the average annual pay for a third of our workforce by $3,700. It's time we raise the wage and give thousands of workers a fair shot.

USDA Seeks Applications to Support Business Development and Create Jobs in Rural America

Washington - The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) today announced that it is accepting applications to support economic development and create jobs in rural America. 

USDA is making this funding available under the Rural Business Development Grant program for eligible entities to support business opportunity and enterprise projects in rural communities. Eligible entities are rural towns, communities, state agencies, authorities, nonprofits, federally-recognized tribes, institutes of higher education and cooperatives. 

The funding may be used to establish business support centers or to finance job training and leadership development in rural areas. Projects must be consistent with any local and area-wide community and economic development strategic plans, support other economic development activities in the project area, and be consistent with any Rural Development state strategic plan. Funding for enterprise projects must be used to finance or develop small and emerging businesses in rural areas. 

This year, USDA anticipates that part of the funding will be set aside for federally-recognized Native American tribes, Rural Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Communities/Rural Economic Area Partnerships, and Strategic Economic and Community Development (SECD) projects. USDA also anticipates a set-aside of funding for projects located in Persistent Poverty areas, including those of Native Americans.

Eligible applicants for the set-aside funds must demonstrate that at least 75 percent of the benefits of an approved grant will assist beneficiaries in the designated areas. Applications must be submitted to the nearest USDA office by 4:30 p.m. local time on March 31, 2021. For additional information, see page 8610 of the Feb. 4, 2021, Federal Register.

Important Vaccine Update
On Tuesday, SC Governor Henry McMaster announced that South Carolinians aged 65 and older will be able to schedule appointments for the COVID-19 vaccine beginning Monday, February 8th. (Previously, the age group was 70 and older.)  SC DHEC has a website to help locate vaccine providers in our state.  Additionally, it has established a care line to call for questions about the COVID-19 vaccines or to help find a provider. That phone number is toll free: (866) 365-8110.  Important: Appointments to receive the COVID-19 vaccine cannot be made on the SC DHEC website or by calling the SC DHEC phone number listed above.  These two SC DHEC resources will only help locate providers near you that may be offering the vaccine. You then will need to take additional steps to create an appointment, depending on that provider's policies.  On a related note, my office has received a significant number of calls about the availability and distribution policies of the COVID-19 vaccine, particularly the requirement of most providers that you must register online with an email address just to make an appointment. I am extremely concerned for those in our state who do not have easy access to the internet and who are finding it very difficult to locate a provider that will accept appointments over the phone.   State and local officials have advised if you know someone who may need assistance creating an email address and scheduling a vaccine appointment online, that you please considering reaching out to offer them help. 
Search SC DHEC for Vaccine Providers

Watch My Recent Forum on Vaccines
I recently hosted a very informative radio forum on the COVID-19 vaccines, which included an expert from SC DHEC as well as a medical doctor who specializes in infectious diseases. You can find a replay of this program, along with a list of each question that was asked, on my website or Facebook page.

Supporting Term Limits
I believe term limits should apply to every single person serving in Congress, including me. That’s why I’ve proposed an amendment to our Constitution that would limit the number of terms someone could serve in the House or Senate.

Efforts to Save Parris Island
Parris Island has significant importance to South Carolina, our military, and our nation. For over 100 years, it has been the preeminent training base for U.S. Marine Corps recruits. With recent news about a possible closure, I've co-sponsored legislation in the House to prevent this from happening.

My Pro-Life Legislation
Even though the 117th Congress officially began just a few weeks ago, I've already sponsored or co-sponsored more than 60 bills in the House of Representatives. Last month, I placed a heavy emphasis on pro-life legislation, signing my name to over 20 bills to protect the lives of unborn children.

2/4/21 13:33,The Hern Roundup: A busy start to the new year,"
￼
Dear Friend,
We're just one month into 2021 and there's already so much to share. The new year kicked off the start of the 117th Congress, welcoming the largest group of Republican women and the most diverse freshman class to the House in history.  I did attend the inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on January 20th. Although there will not be much we agree on, I felt it was my duty as a Member of Congress to witness the peaceful transfer of power.   Biden's speech was full of flowery promises of healing and calls for unity, but he betrayed the American people mere hours later when he issued nearly 20 executive orders on his first night in office. Not only is this wildly unprecedented, but almost every one of his orders resulted in the layoffs of thousands of Americans. Biden says he's waging a war on poverty, but the result looks much more like a war on prosperity.   In spite of all the whiplash-inducing events in our capital, there's a lot I've been working on both at home and in DC. 
￼

Veteran of the Month

""So others may live"" is the essence of the veteran spirit in America. All our veterans deserve our respect and appreciation because they have put everything on the line to protect us. I am pleased to honor Terry Hill as my January Veteran of the Month. Terry served in the U.S. Army as a Medical Evacuation Pilot and flew Black Hawk helicopters to rescue soldiers on their worst day. A stellar career in the Army marked by several commendations, awards, and honors helped make Terry a wonderful leader on the battlefield and at home. 

Not only did Terry come home and start a successful small business after his military career, but her started the RAGFriday Foundation, with the motto ""so others may live."" The non-profit organization offers veterans support and job training to help transition into civilian life. Sometimes that transition involves the help of a service dog, like Jonsey, who serves Terry diligently every day.

Military Academy Nominations

Nominating young patriots to our prestigious military service academies is one of my favorite parts of being a Member of Congress. I was pleased to call two individuals and let them know that I am nominating them for service at West Point and the Naval Academy. Congratulations to Mr. Vincent and Mr. Gilcrest for putting in countless hours of study, physical education, community service, and meeting a list of benchmarks to be accepted into these coveted spots. I look forward to seeing these young men grow and become a part of the next generation of great American leaders. 

For more information about nominations to our nation's military academies, visit Hern.house.gov. 


New Committee Assignments  Earlier this month, I was nominated to serve on the House Committee on Ways and Means. This is a huge honor, as Ways and Means is one of the oldest committees in the House and considered one of the most powerful, as it handles all trade and tax policy and deals with complex legislative issues like healthcare and Social Security.   It's been nearly 20 years since an Oklahoman sat on Ways and Means, so I am proud to serve our state in this role.   

Conversations with Constituents  I was glad to engage in numerous Zoom calls this month with local Chambers of Commerce in our district to discuss several important topics for small businesses, including the successful Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).   Ensuring that our small businesses are equipped with the information and resources they need to continue operating in this difficult time has been a priority for me. My goal is to see our small businesses here at home not only recover from 2020, but flourish in 2021. I am committed to doing everything I can to help make that happen, and I am always happy to provide information directly to my constituents.   If you have any questions regarding the Paycheck Protection Program or any other COVID relief, please call my office at (918) 935-3222.

Roadmap to Congressional Reform  Earlier this month, I introduced the Roadmap to Congressional Reform, a bill package addressing everything from term limits to earmarks and lobbying.   The Roadmap to Reform includes eight separate measures to reform what I believe to be some of the worst practices in Congress.  



Constitutional Term Limits
Members of Congress come to DC for the best job of their lives and never leave - we need to make sure our government is by the people, of the people, and working for the people.  No Budget, No Pay  If Congress can't pass a budget by April 15, as required by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, Congress shouldn't get paid. Our most basic Constitutional responsibility is to write a budget and fund the government. We haven't completed the whole process since 1997. If we can't do that, we should not earn a paycheck.  No Budget, No Recess  If Congress can't pass a budget, we shouldn't be allowed to go home. Funding the government is an incredibly important responsibility, if we have not accomplished a budget by April 15, or fully appropriated funds by August 1, Congress should not be allowed to recess.  Stop the Revolving Door  It is a privilege to represent your community and serve them in Congress. Members shouldn't be motivated to run for office because of potentially lucrative contracts as a lobbyist following their time on Capitol Hill.  Congressional Foreign Lobbying Ban  Similarly, Members who represent their community and work for the betterment of America should not leave Congress and register as a foreign agent.  Read the Bills  All too often, Members of Congress are given hundreds - or even thousands - of pages of bill text with mere moments to read it before the vote is called. There is no possible way of knowing what is included in the bill if Members don't have adequate time to read it. This bill requires bill text to be published for a full week before a vote so Members can fully understand what they're voting on.  Earmark Elimination  Earmarks for special interests is one of the slimy practices that make Americans feel cut off from their elected officials. We must root out even the appearance of corruption in government. We cannot allow this practice to ever return to Congress.  Allowing Members to Opt Out of the Federal Employees Retirement System  Members of Congress are automatically opted into a federal pension system, giving thousands of former legislators a pension for life. We currently spend over $35 million a year on Congressional pensions alone. We should have the option to opt out of this so those tax dollars can be spent on programs to help Americans. 



We are hitting the ground running in February ready to fight for American workers, defend our values, defeat this virus, and get America back to the greatest economy in our history. 


Please let me know if there's anything my office can help you with, call us at (202) 225-2211 in DC or (918) 935-3222 in Tulsa. As always, I keep everything up-to-date at Hern.house.gov and on my Facebook page, so you know what's happening whether I'm in our nation's capitol or at work in Oklahoma.  



Sincerely,

Kevin Hern
Member of Congress

2/4/21 14:08,"Bergman, Case Lead Bipartisan Effort To Address National Debt"," 
￼

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:   February 4, 2021
CONTACT: James Hogge 231-944-7633


Bergman, Case Lead Bipartisan Effort To Address National Debt

Washington - Today, Rep. Jack Bergman (R-MI) and Rep. Ed Case (D-HI) sent a letter to President Joe Biden, urging him to address the growing national debt by establishing a modern-day Grace Commission to root out government waste and inefficiencies.  Rep. Bergman’s bipartisan letter was co-signed by 34 Members of Congress. It features the formal support of advocacy groups including: Americans for Tax Reform, Digital Liberty, Citizens Against Government Waste, National Taxpayers Union, Americans for Prosperity, FreedomWorks, Taxpayers Protection Alliance, and Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.   
In the letter, the bipartisan Members asked that President Biden take action with respect to the looming debt crisis by forming a federal advisory committee composed of private sector citizens, funded by the private sector at no cost to taxpayers, and tasked with reporting on opportunities to cut waste and improve efficiency in the federal government.   This idea is not new - as President Reagan convened a President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control in 1982 for this same purpose. The committee became known as the “Grace Commission” and issued a report with thousands of recommendations on reforms which together could result in significant cost savings at the federal level.  The Members noted in part, “America expects that its government can multitask, working to mitigate multiple economic catastrophes current and future generations may be forced to confront. We are confident private citizens from across our Nation stand ready to assist you in forming regulatory and legislative recommendations to make our government more cost efficient.”
You can read the full letter here  Council for Citizens Against Government Waste (CCAGW) President Tom Schatz said, “As the nation continues to grapple with the economic effects of a global pandemic, and the federal government may spend up to $5.7 trillion on COVID-19 relief, it is more critical than ever for federal agencies to reduce unnecessary costs and eliminate mismanagement of the taxpayers’ money.  CCAGW supports the efforts of Reps. Jack Bergman, Ed Case and other members of Congress to urge President Biden to convene a new President’s Private Sector Survey on Cost Control.  Implementation of the commission’s recommendations would help to create a more effective and efficient federal government."" 
Grover G. Norquist, President, Americans for Tax Reform stated, ""The 'Grace Commission' in the 1980s was a great example of common sense, bi-partisanship and public service by Americans from all walks of life.  It is a model of what works.  Success is always worth repeating.""
“National Taxpayers Union is proud to support this bipartisan letter urging President Biden to create a 21st century “Grace Commission.” As the nation’s debt rapidly approaches $30 trillion, our elected officials must do everything in their power to address this significant problem. Ensuring taxpayer dollars are used effectively and not wasted, as this letter proposes, must be the priority as we begin tackling the nation’s habit of spending beyond its means,” said the National Taxpayers Union.  FreedomWorks President Adam Brandon stated, ""We applaud Representatives Bergman and Case for asking President Biden to set up a commission similar to former President Reagan's Grace Commission, which gave recommendations on bettering the operations of the Executive Branch. They are absolutely correct to cite the national debt as a primary reason why this commission is necessary. Now more than ever, it is critical that our federal government leave no area untouched in looking for ways to address our national debt, no matter how small. We look forward to President Biden answering this call.""
“We commend Representatives Bergman and Case for looking to the American people for ideas to improve the federal government’s operations. An engaged public can help both executive branch officials and Congress reduce governmental waste and improve efficiency,” said Maya MacGuineas, President of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. 
""With a debt of more than $27 trillion, it is imperative that a new Grace Commission be established so taxpayers know where their hard-earned dollars are being spent. We applaud Rep. Bergman for this letter, which every member of Congress should support,” said David Williams, President of Taxpayers Protection Alliance.

2/4/21 15:30,Last Night's Vaccine Town Hall,"Thanks for joining us!
￼ 
  Dear Lindsey, 
For those who may not know, I take time to personally call back some of the thousands of community members who contact us every week. These calls provide me an invaluable perspective into what is top of mind for our community. What I noticed this past month in particular is a sharp increase in questions about vaccines: the FDA approval process, safety and efficacy guidelines, our Commonwealth's distribution plan, and more.  In response, I brought together three subject matter experts for a telephone town hall to address your vaccine questions and provide helpful updates for Berks and Chester counties. Our guests were Dr. Benjamin Abella, Attending Physician and Vice Chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine at Penn Medicine, Jeanne Casner, Director of the Chester County Department of Health, and Andrew Sharp, Deputy Secretary for Intergovernmental Affairs in the Governor's office.   Over 1,000 of you joined us for last night's event, and I wanted to thank you for your thoughtful questions. If you did not get to ask your question live due to the high volume of callers, we will be calling you in the next 48 hours to follow up. I'm sending this short note to share the full audio recording of the event and additional resources for those who are interested. If you only have time to skim this message, please note that VA-enrolled veterans 70 and older can now sign up for vaccine appointments at the Coatesville VA. Details below.

Vaccine Telephone Town Hall

Last Night: Community Town Hall to Discuss Covid Vaccine Distribution
￼
Vaccines are one of the most effective tools we have to contain this virus. I encourage all Pennsylvanians to get the vaccine when it is made available to you. In Congress, I’m working to secure aid for states and localities so that they can more quickly distribute vaccines. 

But even with the vaccine, we must continue to practice social distancing and wear masks to most effectively and efficiently contain and beat this virus. Below is some information about the current state of vaccine distribution in our Commonwealth: 

	•	Pennsylvania is currently in group 1A of the vaccination phase. This includes health care workers, residents of long-term care facilities, persons ages 16-64 with high-risk conditions, and folks 65 and older. An exhaustive list of those who fit under 1A can be found on PA’s vaccine site. 
	•	Those that wish to be vaccinated can pre-register for vaccination on the Chester County vaccination site. Anyone who works or resides in Chester County may pre-register even if they don’t meet the current group criteria. Once you pre-register, you will receive notifications as appointments become available for the COVID-19 vaccine. This will also keep folks updated on the current group phase. 
	•	Constituents living in Berks County can visit the Berks vaccine site to find vaccine providers within the county.
	•	The Coatesville VA is now opening up vaccine appointments to VA-enrolled veterans 70 and older. There are two ways to place interested veterans on the vaccine appointment list: (1) Call 610-384-7711 extension 5705 (or 5706) or (2) Click on this link and scroll to the paragraph where you must sign up to the 'Keep Me Informed' tool for more information. Since the age was just lowered, the official update on the website regarding the age change is forthcoming.
	•	Please contact the PA Dept. of Health if you do not have access to a computer or smartphone at 1-877-724-3258 for more information on scheduling a vaccine appointment. Only folks who fit under the 1A group are being vaccinated at this time, therefore they are the only ones who can schedule vaccination appointments.
To say it has been a difficult year would be an understatement. As a country, we find ourselves in the midst of two crises – a public health and an economic crisis. In order to rebuild our economy, we must do everything in our power to crush this virus. Again, I want to ensure that our office continues to be a source of accurate information during these trying times. Please continue to engage with us and let us know how we can be helpful.
.  .  .

We want to hear from you. Please stay in touch and let us know what you thought of this e-newsletter. As always, we invite you to call one of our offices or message us through our contact form. Feel free to pass this update along to friends of our community so they can keep in touch too.

WASHINGTON, DC – Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) released the following statement on his appointment by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and approval by the House Democratic Caucus to serve once again on the distinguished House Committee on Education and Labor for the 117th Congress. This appointment comes in addition to Espaillat’s earlier appointment to serve on the powerful Appropriations Committee:

Under the leadership of Chairman Scott, the official portrait of Congressman Powell was hung in the committee’s hearing room, enshrining his legacy and the impact on our nation, and I was honored to participate in the unveiling ceremony.

“Chairman Scott has never wavered in his conviction and commitment to equity in education and civil rights for all students and workers in this county, and I look forward to working closely with him once again to ensure educational and workforce opportunities thrive while ensuring equity in our education system, supporting and protecting America’s workforce, and expanding access to high-quality and affordable health care that has brought me back to this committee. I am ready to continue my work and look forward to building on the progress the Education and Labor Committee has created for communities around the nation.”

Dear Lindsey Cormack,

With the second Senate impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump beginning next week, I wanted to provide an opportunity to preview this historic event and answer your questions with Walter Dellinger, former Solicitor General under President Clinton and an impeachment scholar.  I will be hosting a Facebook Live event for the impeachment trial preview on Monday, February 8, 2021 at 4:30 p.m. You can join on Monday by tuning in at facebook.com/RepDavidEPrice. 
Do you have a question about the impeachment of former President Donald Trump? Enter it here. 
The House of Representatives, in a bipartisan vote, passed one article of impeachment against former President Donald Trump on January 13, 2021. The House managers released a trial brief last week, charging former President Trump with incitement of insurrection for his role in the events prior to and on January 6, 2021. The former President’s legal team will have the opportunity to respond on Monday, February 8th, and the trial will begin Tuesday, February 9th.  
I hope you can join Walter Dellinger and me on Monday, February 8th at 4:30 p.m. on Facebook Live for a preview of former President Trump’s impeachment trial. 
Sincerely, 
￼
David Price

Honoring a Fallen Hero
Dear Friends,
It is with a heavy heart that we mourn the death of a true American hero this week. On January 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick was on the frontlines defending the U.S. Capitol from rioters. Like dozens of fellow officers, Sicknick sustained serious injury during the riot, possibly being struck on the head with a fire extinguisher by a still unknown assailant. He later collapsed and was rushed the hospital before tragically dying on January 7.
All Americans should honor the ultimate sacrifice made by Brian Sicknick. He bravely laid his life down to protect his fellow officers, Members of Congress, staffers and support personnel in the Capitol on January 6. My family and I continue to pray for the loved ones he left behind, and all law enforcement injured during the riot.

Let us never forget that the brave men and women of the U.S. Capitol Police – and all law enforcement agencies across the country – put their lives on the line each and every day to protect and serve their communities. We honor their service and I deeply appreciate the selflessness and valor they exhibit on our behalf.
Law enforcement is still investigating Sicknick’s death – and all violent activity that occurred at the Capitol on January 6. If you have information that could contribute to their investigation, please visit the FBI’s tip line website here.

Rep. Gohmert Reminds Democrats of Pres. Biden’s Shameful friendship with KKK Grand Kleagle, Sen. Robert Byrd 
 
During a debate on the House floor today, Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-TX) slammed Democrats for the dangerous precedent they would be setting should they vote to expel Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committee assignments. He also reminded everyone of President Biden’s affinity for former KKK Grand Kleagle, Sen. Robert Byrd. 
 
""Never in the history of the Congress has a majority party taken such fanatical action to remove somebody from the other party from committees,"" said Rep. Gohmert in his speech. ""This is unprecedented! We had a Senator named Biden who looked at a Ku Klux Klan recruiter as a mentor and friend and you punished him by inaugurating him as President.""

2/4/21 21:01,Helping Our Neighbors Recover From Disaster,"
￼

President Joe Biden has officially approved the Emergency Disaster Declaration for Malden and Pine City. Assistance for these communities is on the way so that the families impacted by these wildfires can finally begin to rebuild. The devastation experienced by communities in Eastern Washington during the 2020 wildfire season has left individuals, families, and businesses struggling to piece their lives back together. When I visited Malden and Pine City days after the fire, the devastation took my breath away. The city hall, post office, and fire station were gone. Homes and surrounding farmlands were destroyed.  

The biggest fear I heard when I visited was that after the speeches were over and the news cameras were gone, politicians would forget about Malden. I have worked tirelessly since that visit to make sure that didn’t happen and to push to get these communities the relief they so desperately need.

Governor Jay Inslee transmitted a request for a major disaster declaration for the state, as well as public assistance for Whitman County. I urged both Presidents Trump and Biden to approve this request, and today we received great news that it has finally been approved.
￼

This support is long overdue and I applaud the Biden administration for taking action to approve Governor Inslee’s Disaster Declaration Request. I will continue leading the effort to ensure federal resources reach these communities without delay.

If you or a loved one has been impacted by these wildfires and are in need of assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out to my office.

With the stroke of a pen, President Joe Biden has officially canceled the Keystone XL pipeline. For this week’s breakdown, I want to focus on why this was the wrong decision to make and how it impacts energy independence in America. 

What is the Keystone XL Pipeline? The Keystone XL Pipeline is an expansion of an already existing pipeline system that stretches thousands of miles from Canada to Oklahoma. This pipeline system was designed to allow the safe transport of oil from Canada and North Dakota to refineries in the Midwest and Texas, where it is processed and refined into petroleum products like gasoline. Part of the Keystone XL, which connects Oklahoma to the Gulf Coast of Texas, is already up and running. The second part, which would connect Canada to Kansas, needs a presidential permit in order to move forward. President Trump issued this permit, but President Biden cancelled it on his first day in office.   

Why is it so important? The short answer? Energy independence, global leadership, and national security. The construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline allows the United States to break free from relying on forgeign countries like China, Russia, and Saudi Arabia for energy sources, and it allows us to supply energy to our global allies. So, not only does the Keystone XL help keep energy prices low at home, but it also helps prevent hostile foreign actors from gaining more power. The importance of U.S. energy independence, global leadership, and national security is something we should all agree on, and it’s something we should be building on, not tearing down.   

What is the economic impact?hat is the economic impact? President Biden’s decision to cancel the Keystone XL Pipeline reportedly has resulted in the immediate elimination of more than 1,000 jobs. Experts predict that this project would have created more than 11,000 American jobs and generated more than $1.6 million in wages. The less Americans working, the more our economy struggles. America must lead on energy and show the world that we can develop it safely while creating opportunities for American families and businesses. 

What does its cancelation mean for Eastern Washington? Individuals, families, and businesses continue to struggle due to the economic hardship brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. The last thing our community needs is a unilateral decision that drives up energy prices, makes it more difficult to put food on the table, and threatens our national security. That’s why I support legislation like the Keystone XL Pipeline Construction and Jobs Act to make sure we continue to lead on this issue, keeping energy costs low for Eastern Washington families and promoting American-led energy innovation.

This week, the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations held a hearing on our efforts to ramp up vaccine distribution across the country. While the development and approval of several COVID-19 vaccines in less than a year is one of the greatest achievements in American history and modern science, our work is far from over. 

Our committee is leading the charge to oversee and ramp up vaccine distribution with the goal of vaccinating as many Americans as quickly as possible. Together, we can save lives, get our economy back and schools back open, and get our lives back to normal.
￼

	•	Hearing on COVID-19 Vaccines Across America – As Lead Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee, I attended a hearing on America’s efforts to ramp up vaccine distribution and get as many Americans vaccinated as possible. President Biden said we are at war with the coronavirus, and I agree. We must come together to defeat this virus and get our lives back to normal. 
	•	Hearing on Ramping Up COVID-19 Vaccines, Testing, and Medical Supply Chain – Also this week on the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health was a hearing to find new, innovative ways to build on the success of Operation Warp Speed and improve the medical supply chain all across America. This is a serious challenge we must face head on in order to end this pandemic once and for all. 
	•	Hearing on Protecting Americans From Scams During the Pandemic – Finally, the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce held a hearing today on making sure Americans consumers are safe from scams during the ongoing pandemic. I was happy to invite Traci Pronto to testify about the work Spokane Community Oriented Policing Services is doing to counter these scams. Traci shared how COVID has isolated too many in Spokane, putting them at a higher risk of falling prey to scammers. If you or a loved one have been scammed, I encourage you to contact Spokane COPS by clicking here.

I recently had the privilege of speaking with members of the 141st Security Forces Squadron at Fairchild Air Force Base. These brave servicemen and servicewomen have worked tirelessly to defend our nation’s capital, and continue working hard to respond to the ongoing pandemic. I hope you’ll join me in extending our sincere thanks for their service and sacrifice. Click here to view more photos.

2/5/21 10:06,A quick update,"￼
Dear Friend,
 
I can’t tell you how grateful my family and I are for all of the well wishes we’ve received since I tested positive for COVID-19 last week.
 
Since then, I’ve been quarantining away from my husband and our two girls, and I’m so glad to be able to tell you that as of yesterday, they are still COVID-free. I’ve been feeling many of the typical minor symptoms – body aches, headaches and dizziness, and fatigue – but I recognize how fortunate I am to just be dealing with these less severe effects from the virus.
 
As I mentioned to you last week, I remain hard at work to deliver for our district, and I wanted to take a moment to fill you in on what we’ve been able to get done since I last emailed.
 
One step closer to COVID relief
 
There’s no question that folks right here in our community, across our Commonwealth, and around our country are in desperate need of more relief. For most, those $600 payments were spent weeks ago, unemployment benefits are just weeks from expiring, and affording their kids’ next meal is a constant worry.
 
We took action in the House this week to set up the process to make sure we can get a COVID-19 relief package – a bold one – through the Senate without Mitch McConnell being able to hold it up. We’re working overtime to get that package passed and signed into law by President Biden without any lapses in benefits and with robust investments in vaccine distribution to get shots into arms as soon as possible.
 
There’s no question that we’d rather this package have bipartisan support and that those conversations are ongoing, but I want you to know that nothing will deter us from getting a package that meets this moment across the finish line. If passing more direct payments, extended unemployment benefits, and additional housing and food assistance requires us to go it alone, we’re prepared to do so.
 
In the meantime, my office continues to be a resource to anyone in the Third District who thinks we can be helpful accessing the relief or benefits they’re owed. If we can be helpful, please give us a call at 978-459-0101 or email us at Rep.LoriTrahan@mail.house.gov.
 
Jobs, jobs, jobs
 
Later today, the House will take up and pass the National Apprenticeship Act of 2021, bipartisan legislation that will invest more than $3.5 billion over the next five years to create nearly one million new apprenticeship opportunities for American workers.
 
I’m pleased to report this landmark legislation includes my bill to ensure that small businesses and their workers are able to reap the rewards of these highly lucrative jobs programs.
 
Apprenticeships are one of the most successful ways to jumpstart our economy and get folks back to work. 94 percent of workers who complete a registered apprenticeship are employed at the conclusion of their programs and they earn an average of more than $70,000 annually. But less one percent of workers nationwide have completed an apprenticeship.
 
I’ll vote this afternoon using the House’s proxy voting system to finally change that.
 
Stay safe, wear a mask
 
I know I’ve become a broken record at this point, but I wouldn’t be doing my job both as your representative and as a mom if I didn’t say once again how important it is to continue following the guidelines on social distancing and gatherings.
 
We’re seeing cases start to go down right now, and that’s a testament to how well the vaccines are working already. But we still have a ways to go until we crush this virus, and each of us has an important role to play in making sure we get there as soon as possible.
 
So please, keep wearing that mask, maintaining a safe social distance from others, and staying home whenever you can. We’re all in this together.
 
Warm Regards,

Dear Friend:
 
I can’t wait to cheer on the Buccaneers this Sunday in our hometown Super Bowl! Please stay safe while we root on the Bucs to victory.
 
Wednesday, I paid respects to US Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick on behalf of our community. President Biden and Vice President Harris honored Officer Sicknick as well. I felt the weight of the pall that remains over the Capitol and the country as I prayed for Officer Sicknick in the Capitol Rotunda a few weeks after the violent attack at the heart of our democracy. He and the other officers who stood in the breach that day are true heroes.
 
As the COVID-19 pandemic rages on, I am focused on working with President Biden to accelerate vaccine distribution and deliver aid home to support our neighbors in need. We must use every tool at our disposal to crush COVID-19, keep families afloat and help children return to school safely. The Congress will pass a budget resolution this week to clear a path for President Biden’s American Rescue Plan. We must come together to deliver emergency aid to carry us through both the health and related economic crises. Read more about the American Rescue Plan here.
 
I am particularly concerned that Florida failed to plan ahead for vaccine distribution in an equitable way especially for hard-hit communities of color and those without access to a Publix or appointments. This week, I wrote President Biden regarding my concerns with Gov. DeSantis’ disjointed rollout. I am thankful that the Biden Administration has a national strategy – it’s critical that we leave no one behind.
 
My team is working hard to compile the most up-to-date information on vaccines in Tampa and Hillsborough County, and you can access that information here.
  
 
My Committees
 
  
￼
Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health held a hearing entitled ""Road to Recovery: Ramping Up COVID-19 Vaccines, Testing, and Medical Supply Chain."" In Florida, we have seen a troubling pattern of withholding and censoring data regarding nursing home infections and deaths, overall mortality data and more. Now is the time to increase transparency and strengthen our public health infrastructure, and I’m working in Congress to do so. 
  
￼
The Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce held an important hearing entitled ""Safeguarding American Consumers: Fighting Fraud and Scams During the Pandemic."" Bad actors continue to try and scam our neighbors throughout the pandemic, and we must take serious action to protect seniors and families and hold fraudsters accountable. 
 
If you believe you have received a solicitation that is a scam, report it to Hillsborough County - Consumer and Veterans Services or the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services by filing a consumer complaint. Call at 1-800-HELP-FLA or 1-800-FL-AYUDA for Spanish speakers, or file a complaint online at FloridaConsumerHelp.com.
  
 
Votes This Week
 
  
￼
H.R. 447 – National Apprenticeship Act of 2021 amends the National Apprenticeship Act to invest in our workforce by prioritizing skills training and increasing access to trade schools. It will connect our Tampa neighbors to better jobs and better wages, as apprenticeship opportunities are direct pathways to high-paying, stable jobs that you can raise a family on. 
  
￼
H.Con.Res. 11 – Establishing the congressional budget for the U.S. Government for fiscal year 2021 and setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal years 2022 through 2030: Passage of this resolution will allow for House Democrats to take decisive action and pass the American Rescue Plan to send aid home to families, small businesses, schools, hospitals, and more. It’s critical to crushing the coronavirus, saving lives and livelihoods, and getting our economy back on track.
  
￼
H.Res. 72 –  Removing a certain Member from certain standing committees of the House of Representatives: I support removing Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from the Education Committee after her harassment of a student victim of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, FL came to light. In any other workplace, if someone threatened coworkers, espoused dangerous conspiracy theories and cheered on QAnon, they would be terminated entirely.
  
Thank you to all of our neighbors who joined my telephone town hall yesterday with local experts to answer your questions on COVID-19 and resources available to you. If you missed Wednesday's event, you can watch it here.
 
As always, my office is here to help you at 813-871-2817. Stay safe and healthy. Let’s go Bucs!

2/5/21 11:00,February 2021 Squeal Award: Public Health Preparedness Budget a Piggy Bank for Bureaucrats,"￼ 
  

Home  |  Make’ Em Squeal  |  Email Joni  



February 2021 Squeal Award: Public Health Preparedness Budget a Piggy Bank for Bureaucrats  Ernst cracks down on illegal raids of the nation’s pandemic fund  
How does spending millions of dollars on office furniture moves and legal services help stop a global pandemic?   It doesn’t. In fact, it leaves us less prepared.     These are just two of the questionable, and illegal, ways the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) – the agency charged with protecting our nation from public health emergencies – misspent taxpayer dollars during the decade leading up to the coronavirus pandemic. 
This was no accident, folks. The culprits knowingly wasted your tax dollars then misled Congress about it.   Due to a whistleblower, the scheme was uncovered in which a high level official at HHS regularly raided the budget of the department that is in charge of developing public health countermeasures, like vaccines. Bureaucrats were abusing this department as a type of piggy bank to pay for other, unrelated purposes, like news subscriptions and salaries for employees who did not even work in the department!    We aren’t talking about a few dollars here and there, folks. This was a “widespread and well-known” scheme involving tens, possibly hundreds of millions of dollars over a decade, according to a report by the U.S. Office of Special Counsel.    Another name for it is “criminal.” In fact, the HHS Office of Inspector General determined this misuse of funds is a flagrant violation of federal law 

￼
For lying to Congress, misspending millions of taxpayer dollars, and putting the health of Americans at risk, I am awarding my February 2021 Squeal Award to the criminal bureaucrats who got caught stealing from us taxpayers.   I am also introducing the Federal Actors Lying Should be Eliminated (FALSE) Act to fire federal employees who knowingly misspend taxpayer money and falsify information provided to Congress and taxpayers about how your hard earned dollars are being spent.   Washington needs to understand once and for all, it is not just how much you spend, BUT HOW YOU SPEND IT! In the Senate, I’ll continue fighting to ensure transparency, accountability, and results for every dollar Washington takes and spends.

Do you have an example of government waste or inefficiencies that I should take a look at? Send me an email by clicking here.

February 5, 2021 
Dear Lindsey,  With forty executive orders in his first ten days, President Joe Biden is undertaking an effort to drastically change the country with the wave of a magic wand – or at least a pen. Rejoining the Paris Accord, canceling the Keystone XL pipeline permit, stopping construction of the border wall, and granting citizenship to millions of illegal aliens, endangers our national security, kills American jobs, and makes us more dependent on our foreign adversaries.
 
Congress must reclaim the power to legislate. The Legislative Branch is designed to make broad policy decisions through deliberation and legislation, with clear checks and balances in place.

See what I've been up to below. 
  
 
Mitigating the Threat of China 
 
  
This week, I joined a bipartisan call asking the Senate to hold Governor Raimondo’s confirmation until the Biden Administration gives a clear and direct answer on whether they plan to keep Huawei on the Commerce Department’s Entity List.

Honoring Ghost Army Veterans 
 
  
This week I introduced the Ghost Army Congressional Gold Medal Act. This bipartisan legislation honors two top-secret WWII U.S. Army units that specialized in tactical deceptions with the Congressional Gold Medal. [ABC 4 News]
 
Using inflatable tanks, mannequins, and decoys, the Ghost Army is credited with saving tens of thousands of lives. Their extraordinary accomplishments and techniques were so groundbreaking that they remained classified for more than 40 years. This bill brings long-overdue recognition and appreciation to these soldiers and their families by awarding them with the Congressional Gold Medal, Congress's highest expression of national appreciation. [KUTV 2 News]
 
Of the 1,100 soldiers that served in this elite unit during WWII, only 11 are still alive today. Among them is 102-year-old Utahn Staff Sergeant Stanley Nance. I joined Lee Lonsberry on KSL Newsradio to discuss my legislation and my efforts to honor these heroes. Click here to listen to the full segment.

Safe from the Start Act 
 
  
This week I introduced the Safe from the Start Act. This bipartisan bill builds on those values by ensuring children and women across the world are protected from gender-based violence. [KUTV 2 News]
 
America will always defend and support the most vulnerable—at home & abroad. In times of crisis & conflict, Americans continuously step up & show compassion through leading humanitarian efforts. This bill builds on those values by ensuring children and women across the world are protected from gender-based violence.

Western Caucus Vice Chair
 
  
I’m honored to serve on the Executive Committee of the Congressional Western Caucus. With a district mostly composed of rural counties, the issues that this Caucus focuses on directly affect the daily life of my constituents.
 
There’s no organization in Washington, D.C. that works harder on public lands, natural resources, and rural issues. I look forward to working with my colleagues to bring home wins to Utah and the West.

2/5/21 11:31,Baldwin Introduces Bill to Protect Workers’ Right to Organize and Make our Economy Work for Everyone,"

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
Today, Senator Baldwin, a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), helped introduce the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, comprehensive labor legislation to protect workers’ right to stand together and bargain for fairer wages, better benefits, and safer workplaces. 
“In Wisconsin and across the country we have seen powerful, corporate special interests, and the politicians that they fund, attack workers’ rights and undermine our labor laws. The result has been a shrinking middle class, rising income inequality, and more economic insecurity for working families,” said Senator Baldwin. “This legislation takes bold action to respect and reward the hard work of the men and women in labor by protecting and strengthening workers’ rights. The PRO Act takes a stand for workers so they can stand together for fair pay, a safe workplace, quality health care, and the dignity of a secure retirement they worked hard to earn.” 
The pandemic has made it clearer than ever that our economy is benefitting the biggest corporations and wealthiest individuals, while failing workers, and in particular women and workers of color. While wages are stagnant for the bottom 50 percent of workers, the top one percent of earners have seen their wages grow by 205 percent. This worsening income inequality has the deepest impact on women and workers of color, who disproportionately have jobs with lower wages and fewer, if any, benefits.  Unions are critical to increasing wages and addressing growing income inequality—with studies showing that union members earn on average 19 percent more than those with similar education, occupation, and experience in a non-union workplace. The PRO Act would reverse years of attacks on unions and restore fairness to the economy by strengthening the federal laws that protect workers’ rights to join a union and bargain for higher wages and better benefits.  
Specifically, the PRO Act would protect the right to organize and collectively bargain by: 
	•	Bolstering remedies and punishing violations of workers’ rights through authorizing meaningful penalties for employers that violate workers’ rights, strengthening support for workers who suffer retaliation for exercising their rights, and authorizing a private right of action for violation of workers’ rights.
	•	Strengthening workers’ right to join together and negotiate for better working conditions by enhancing workers’ right to support secondary boycotts, ensuring workers can collect “fair share” fees, modernizing the union election process, and facilitating initial collective bargaining agreements.
	•	Restoring fairness to an economy rigged against workers by closing loopholes that allow employers to misclassify their employees as supervisors and independent contractors and increasing transparency in labor-management relations.

NEW OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD

In an effort to help Americans who have lost their health insurance coverage due to the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, President Biden recently issued an executive order reopening the enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act to help expand access to health insurance during this public health emergency. No one should be denied access to health insurance during a public health emergency, and I’m glad to see President Biden take action to ensure more Americans have access to sign up for health care coverage.

Connect for Health Colorado, Colorado’s health exchange marketplace, will re-open enrollment for Coloradans beginning February 8th through May 15th. Coverage will begin on the first day of the month following enrollment, for instance if you enroll in February your coverage will begin March 1st. 

Connect for Health Colorado offers individuals and families a one-stop-shop to compare policies, sign up for high-quality, affordable health insurance, and receive financial assistance. For more information or to enroll, visit connectforhealthco.com or call (855) 752-6749. 


STOCK MARKET VOLATILITY

For millions of hardworking Americans, the stock market is a vehicle for growing savings for retirement, to send kids to college, or to save up for a down payment on a home. But the foundation of an efficient market is rooted in fairness— that all investors play by the same set of rules and have access to the same information. The recent events surrounding GameStop has resulted in increased market volatility and trading volume over the last few weeks, leading to several brokerage platforms suspending or restricting purchases of shares of GameStop and other volatile stocks. 

￼

My biggest concern in this scenario is with the small investors and constituents who had the rules changed on them late in the game and who were left holding the bag. Congress needs to investigate the transactions and sequence of events to better understand what exactly happened, and if retail investors were treated unfairly. The House Financial Services Committee, of which I’m a member, plans to hold a hearing on the issue on February 18th. I look forward to asking questions during the hearing and working to ensure we prevent small investors from getting hurt in the future.

If you have questions or concerns, please contact the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy at 1-800-732-0330 or email them at Help@SEC.gov.


LOCAL HEROES

While United States Capitol Police Officer Brian D. Sicknick is not from Colorado, this week we honored him as he lied in honor in the U.S. Capitol for his heroic actions during the January 6th attack. Officer Sicknick exemplified the bravery and self-sacrifice that so many members of our law enforcement demonstrate every day as they protect our communities and our country. Thank you Officer Sicknick for your service to our country, and my deepest sympathies go out to your fellow officers, friends and family.

￼

My friend and colleague, Rep. French Hill (R-AR) and I introduced a resolution to honor the service of USCP officers on Jan. 6, including Officer Sicknick who is only the fourth USCP officer in history to be killed in the line of duty. 

I also want to recognize and honor Laura Schwartzenberger, an FBI agent and Colorado native who was killed while executing a federal search warrant in Sunrise, Florida this week.

And we can’t forget the critical role of National Guard members this past year as troops were deployed across the country to work on the frontlines against the deadly COVID-19 virus. In Colorado, the Guard assisted in administering more than 110,000 COVID 19 tests in more than 28 Colorado counties, served as logisticians for PPE warehousing, packaging, and distribution to designated community organizations, and augmented more than 13 local emergency operation centers around Colorado. The Colorado National Guard’s COVID-19 mission is now the largest and longest activation of the National Guard in our state’s history.

I was glad I could help a National Guardsman from Delaware become a U.S. citizen as a small token of my appreciation for all the National Guard troops coming to the aid and defense of our country.

￼

While we live in a divisive and chaotic time, our country can come together through shared values including honoring and appreciating those who put country first, no matter the price. A grateful Congressman and nation thanks you.

2/5/21 12:04,Senator Bennet’s Weekly Update,"A message from Senator Michael Bennet 
￼
Hello everyone,  
I’m feeling a bit bleary-eyed today after we voted late into the night to advance a budget resolution, the first step to achieving President Biden’s COVID rescue plan. Some Senate Republicans, led by Minority Leader McConnell and Ted Cruz, tried to block this effort with one obscure amendment after another, but we overcame that effort. Now, we’re one step closer to passing a relief package that actually reflects the unprecedented scope of the economic and public health crisis we face.  
On Wednesday, I spoke on the Senate floor about the historic opportunity we have to turn the page on decades of rising inequality and declining mobility by building an economy that grows for everyone, not just those at the top. This relief plan is a chance to make the kind of investments in our public health infrastructure, small businesses, workers, and families that are long overdue. 
￼ 
I am especially grateful that the president’s plan includes my proposal to dramatically expand the child tax credit and make it fully refundable for the first time. That idea alone would cut child poverty almost in half in one year without adding a single federal bureaucrat. It would be one of the most significant steps to provide economic security and opportunity to American families in a generation. As I told Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne earlier this week, if you voted for the Trump tax cut for the wealthiest people in the country, how can you be against a middle-class tax cut in the middle of a pandemic?  
So many Coloradans need us to rise to the challenge and meet this difficult moment, and I’m going to work as hard as I can to make sure we do. 
Until next week, 
 ￼  Michael 

FIGHTING FOR THE CORE ACT 
This week, Senator Hickenlooper, Congressman Neguse, and I reintroduced the Colorado Outdoor Recreation & Economy (CORE) Act, our landmark bill to grow our outdoor economy and protect over 400,000 acres of public land in Colorado. The bill reflects over a decade of work by Coloradans who came together night after night to hammer out compromises and do something special for the next generation. With a new administration in the White House and a new Democratic majority in the Senate, we now have a historic opportunity to push the CORE Act across the finish line, and we’re going to do everything we can to get this done for Colorado.

News from Representative GaramendiClick here to open this e-mail in its own browser window     Click here to open a plain text version of this email 

 
Dear Friend, 
UC Davis’ and Davis City’s jointly operated Healthy Davis Together (HDT) program is providing free COVID-19 tests to anyone who lives or works in Davis. Additionally, the HDT Business Partner program, is working with local businesses to ensure they have the resources they need to keep their doors open safely – for their employees and customers. The program has also trained dozens of graduate students to help with contact tracing; recruited hotel and apartment owners to provide free isolation and quarantine housing to anyone in town exposed to the virus; and hired at least 275 undergraduate ambassadors to combat health disinformation and hand out free masks.
Through this program, U.C. Davis has made free coronavirus tests — available twice weekly, with overnight results — accessible to all 69,500 residents and hundreds of nonresidents who work in the City of Davis. To learn more about HDT you can visit its website at HealthyDavisTogether.org. 
Free COVID-19 Testing 
HDT is providing free, painless, saliva-based COVID-19 tests for anyone who lives or works in Davis. They can provide testing to individuals at least once a week, or twice a week for people whose jobs require frequent interaction with others (e.g. frontline and healthcare workers). Thanks to cutting-edge research from UC Davis scientists and medical experts, testing is easy, painless, and only requires that one to spit into a tube, . Tests are quick, and many people report getting in and out of the testing site in five to ten minutes. Confidential results are typically available within one to two days. 
Symptom-free doesn’t mean COVID-free. HDT's COVID-19 testing has found that as many as 1 in 25 people getting tested are infected, yet have no idea because they do not experience or exhibit any symptoms. A negative test one day does not mean that you will receive a negative result the following day; therefore testing at least once a week is critically important. Frequent testing is the best tool we have for detecting infection before COVID-19 spreads, along with continuing to wear masks, social distancing, and regular hand-washing.   
Testing is available at multiple locations across Davis, and includes free parking. To learn more about the testing being conducted by HDT you can visit HDT's website at HealthDavisTogether.org/Testing. 
	•	Davis Senior Center – 646 A Street, Davis, CA, 95616
	•	Mondavi Center – 523 Mrak Hall Drive, Davis, CA, 95616
	•	Veterans Memorial Center – 203 East 14th Street Davis, CA, 95616
HDT Business Partner Program 
The Healthy Davis Together Business Partner Program provides access to resources and support for Davis businesses to keep their employees and customers safe and healthy. HDT provides free, weekly COVID-19 tests for business partner employees, grants for safety supplies and services, and free personal protective equipment (PPE), in addition to other resources. HDT is also working with local business partners to develop and implement a gift card incentive program to encourage COVID-19 testing in the community while also supporting local businesses at the same time. To learn more about participating businesses you can visit HDT's website at HealthyDavisTogether.org/Partners.

2/5/21 13:01,Blaine’s Bulletin: Giving a Voice to the Voiceless,"￼ 
February 5, 2021
For Immediate Release | Contact: Georgeanna Sullivan (202) 225-2956 

BLAINE'S BULLETIN: GIVING A VOICE TO THE VOICELESS
This year marks the 48th anniversary of the tragic Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. Each January, tens of thousands of Americans from across the country gather in Washington, D.C. to celebrate the right to life and have their voices heard as they encourage Congress and government leaders to do everything in their power to protect the unborn. This year’s celebration of life happened last Friday, and while it could not take place in person, there was no shortage of participation or enthusiasm for this incredibly important cause. 
As a father, grandfather and Christian, I have always been a strong believer in the sanctity of life. As a member of Congress, I am fortunate to be in a position to do something about it. Throughout my time in office, I have supported countless bills to end abortion and the terrible practices associated with it. Just last week, I introduced the Protecting Life and Integrity in Research Act which ensures taxpayer funded research will never support the horrific practice of trafficking infant body parts for profit and the endangerment of human life. This legislation prohibits the Secretary of Health and Human Services, who authorizes National Institutes of Health research, from conducting or supporting any research involving human fetal tissue that is obtained through an induced abortion. It seems almost unbelievable that the deeply disturbing practice of selling baby body parts is taking place in modern day America, but I will continue to do everything in my power to put an end to it. 
Over the last several years, Missouri has become a national leader in the pro-life movement, having the second lowest abortion rate in the country according to the CDC. Our state is home to a substantial and effective pro-life community and thanks to their persistence, we are getting closer and closer to becoming the first abortion-free state in the nation. As we continue to make progress in eliminating abortions, Missouri has also made support for expectant mothers a priority. Sadly, some women do find themselves in a position where they feel that abortion is their only option, but through programs like the MO HealthNet for Pregnant Women and the Show-Me Healthy Babies programs, our state is providing assistance and resources to ensure they and their children are supported before and after birth. 
The last four years were some of the most significant for the pro-life movement in our nation’s history. The most lasting impact comes from President Trump transformation of our nation’s courts, having appointed a record number of conservative pro-life judges and three Supreme Court Justices. He signed an executive order to ensure medical care for all infants who are born alive, including newborns who were born in the case of a failed abortion. It seems unfathomable that a law would have to be passed for this to be the case, but I am grateful that President Trump fought to protect all babies, regardless of circumstance. And finally, taxpayer funding to Planned Parenthood was cut by $60 million. 
Unfortunately, the Biden Administration’s stance on abortion and the right to life differs greatly from my own and the next four years will be a much more uphill battle in the fight for the unborn. Be that as it may, my fellow pro-life colleagues and I stand at the ready to continue to do everything in our power in Congress to protect the sanctity of life and continue to give a voice to the voiceless. 
CONTACT US: As always, for those of you with Internet access, I encourage you to visit my official website. For those without access to the Internet, I encourage you to call my offices in Jefferson City (573-635-7232) Washington, Mo.

News from Representative GaramendiClick here to open this e-mail in its own browser window     Click here to open a plain text version of this email 

 
Dear Friend, 
Sadly, many American businesses are on the brink of closing due to the compounding COVID-19 crisis. The federal government must take every action it can to support American manufacturers and workers. Smart Make it in America policies allow us to get the biggest bang for our buck, ensuring our taxpayer dollars are used wisely to support American jobs and innovation. 
 
As a leading voice in the House of Representatives for those policies, I am taking critical steps in Congress to ensure that more of the products Americans buy are made by American workers in American factories. My work builds upon the executive order President Biden issued on January 25th to support ""Buy American"" policies by directing federal agencies to buy goods and services that are American-made to the extent possible. On the same day, I reintroduced my American Food for American Schools Act to strengthen “Buy American” standards for school lunches.  Even in Northern Californian and Central Valley farming communities, some school districts use taxpayer dollars to buy imported foods. Some of those imported foods have been recalled due to safety concerns when they could have been sourced locally in California. My bill expands ""Buy American"" requirements under the National School Lunch Program and increases transparency within the program.This week, I will be voting to pass the National Apprenticeship Act, which will ensure more Americans have a pathway to high-quality jobs by expanding access to high-quality registered apprenticeship, youth apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs. These programs are America’s most successful federally authorized workforce development program with 94 percent of participants earning an average starting wage of above $70,000 annually. To learn more about these apprenticeship programs you can visit the Department of Labor’s website here.We must rebuild our once robust manufacturing sector, repower our factories and assembly lines, hire the working men and women of this great nation, and restore America’s once prospering middle class. I look forward to achieving these goals by continuing to fight for Buy American and Make it in America policies this Congress. 
Sincerely,

Week in Review

 
 
Addressing Local Vaccine & Supply Shortages
 
In a virtual roundtable, I met with hospitals administrators from across Central New York to assess local need and offer my support in Congress as we continue working to help our community emerge from this pandemic.  We discussed PPE and supply issues, as well as issues with our local vaccine rollout effort. Our community is incredibly grateful to Central New York hospitals and healthcare providers for the sacrifices they made to protect and care for us during this pandemic. And in Congress, I pledge to continue working to provide them with the support and resources they deserve. 
Later, to address these local concerns, I spoke directly with representatives from FEMA, HHS, and DoD. Each agency plays a critical role in procuring and distributing vaccines. To accelerate our local vaccine rollout, I urged the officials to take steps to address supply and distribution issues and ensure Central New Yorkers are able to get vaccinations in a timely and efficient manner.

I-81 Project Update
 
I invited Secretary Pete Buttigieg, the newly confirmed head of the Department of Transportation, to tour the I-81 Viaduct in Syracuse and urged his agency to provide an update regarding the project. As a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I look forward to working with Secretary Buttigieg, as well as other federal, state, and local officials, to move this project forward.

Pushing a Bipartisan COVID Relief Effort
 
There is strong support on both sides of the aisle for an additional pandemic relief bill that includes funds to strengthen national vaccination and testing programs, immediate assistance to individuals and families, and expanded support for struggling businesses. Despite this, Democratic Leaders in Congress have signaled they intend to use the partisan budget reconciliation process, a tool which allows spending legislation, such as COVID-19 relief, to be enacted without bipartisan support. To ensure the needs of all American communities are reflected in future pandemic relief legislation, I led Members in the Republican Governance Group in an effort to urge President Biden to reject this partisan process and include input from lawmakers in both parties.  

Legislative Update: Harriet Tubman on the $20 Bill
 
At the start of the 117th Congress, I’m proud to reintroduce legislation that will direct the U.S. Treasury to finalize the redesign of the $20 bill featuring Harriet Tubman. In Central New York, we are honored that Harriet Tubman settled in our community and take great pride in celebrating her incredible legacy. My effort aims to celebrate Tubman’s legacy, commitment to freedom and equality, and highlight her connection to Central New York.

According to the CDC, between June 2019 and May 2020, 81,000 Americans died from drug overdoses, the highest number ever recorded in a 12-month period. Now more than ever, we must work to prevent addiction and ensure those with substance use disorders receive the treatment and support needed to recover. That’s why I’m pleased to announce Onondaga Council on Alcoholism & Addictions, Inc. will receive $133,000 in federal funds to address youth substance use in Central New York. These funds will provide the center with the necessary resources to continue offering prevention programming for the next five years.

 $70K in Federal Funds to Spur Job Growth & Economic Development in Central New York
 
Through my work on the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, I’ve led initiatives to strengthen investments from the Economic Development Administration (EDA) in CNY and communities nationwide. I’m pleased to announce that the Central New York Regional Planning Board is receiving $70,000 in federal funding from the EDA. With these funds, the Board will be better equipped to carry out its mission of creating local jobs and strengthening our regional economy as we recover from the ongoing pandemic. I’m proud to be able to continue supporting this important goal in Congress.

Legislative Update: Renewing Effort to Resolve Errors within Trusted Traveler Programs & Keep Travelers Safe
 
I am proud to have reintroduced the Trusted Traveler Reconsideration and Restoration Act, a bill that I introduced after hearing from a Central New Yorker who had their Trusted Traveler status erroneously revoked by the Department of Homeland Security. My legislation provides relief to individuals who have fallen victim to these errors by extending their plan by the equivalent of the delay. It also takes steps to prevent future inaccuracies by examining Homeland Security’s efforts to effectively manage enrollment lists. I have been a strong proponent of the Trusted Traveler programs because they make screening procedures more efficient for both pre-vetted travelers and security personnel while keeping our nation’s airports safe. However, as the lead Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, I recognize there’s more to be done to enhance these programs. I remain committed to making all necessary fixes.

Big Tech’s Bridge Too Far 

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the Supreme Leader of Iran, has advocated for the destruction of Israel and is directly responsible for the deaths of U.S. troops. The President of Venezuela, Nicolas Maduro, jails and kills dissidents in his country and paints a rosy picture to the public. The Communist Chinese spew propaganda to the world on a platform that cannot even be accessed by its own people. So which platform allows Ayatollah Khamenei, President Maduro, and Communist Chinese propaganda? Twitter.
Twitter permanently banned a sitting United States President but allows these and other despots to have a global platform. Not only this, Twitter and other social media platforms are now attempting to control speech by banning conservatives from their platforms. These are American companies doing something that is antithetical to the values outlined in our Constitution; using their immense power to shut down free speech. When Jack Dorsey, the Chief Executive Officer of Twitter testified before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in 2018, I warned him that if he didn’t fix the issues that were laid out before him in that hearing that Congress would move from having done nothing since he founded Twitter in his Harvard dorm room to overreacting. @jack doesn’t follow me on Twitter at @USRepLong and he sure didn’t follow what I told him that day. Twitter hasn’t moved from the sublime to the ridiculous, they have moved from the ridiculous to the absurdly ridiculous. As a result they now have Congress’ full undivided attention. 
One way that Congress has been looking at holding these companies accountable is by reforming or repealing and replacing Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. Section 230 states that: ""No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider."" Translation: these companies cannot be held liable if a user posts something illegal on a company’s website. Section 230 goes on to state that “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of—any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or availability of material that the provider or user considers to be obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is constitutionally protected.” This language gives free rein to internet companies to remove content that they deem to be “objectionable” in any way. Do most far-left liberals working at companies like Twitter think conservatives are objectionable? Over the last four years, we have learned the answer to that question is a resounding yes.
So where do we go from here? Section 230 has been essential for the growth of the internet and has played a critical role in making sure e-commerce companies can grow without the worry of being liable for something a random user does on their website. A lot has changed since 1996 though and we need to bring Section 230 into the 21st century. I do not believe that Section 230 should be repealed outright as that would have an extremely detrimental impact on e-commerce, but I do believe it needs to be clarified, refined, and reformed. For instance, striking “otherwise objectionable” from the above language of Section 230 could be an answer to stopping big tech from removing opposing political views that their employees may think are objectionable, but most people do not. Another simple change could be to clearly define what makes an internet company a publisher, as publishers are not protected under Section 230. With companies selectively editing and moderating political content, are they making editorial decisions on what is and is not allowed to be published on their platform? Some would argue yes. Clarifying what is and isn’t a publisher could be a simple solution to rein in social media censorship.
The censorship on social media should alarm Republicans and Democrats alike. Sure, Democrats may feel like big tech is on their side now, but what will happen when Democrats start espousing views that big tech doesn’t agree with? It does not matter to me if you’re advocating the political views of former President Donald J.Trump, or President Joseph R. Biden, Jr., in America no one should have to worry about their views being shut down over their political beliefs. Republicans have been calling for the reform of Section 230; will Democrats join us, or will they sit on the sidelines as big tech shreds our first amendment rights? It is time Congress rein in big tech and reform Section 230.

2/5/21 14:01,Risch and Pro-Life Senators Tell Leadership: No Taxpayer Dollars to Fund Abortion,"￼ 
Contact:  Marty Cozza 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
February 5, 2021
Risch and Pro-Life Senators Tell Leadership: No Taxpayer Dollars to Fund Abortion 
BOISE, Idaho — U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho) along with Senator Steve Daines (R-Mont.) and 46 other pro-life senators today sent a unified message to Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer underscoring their commitment to block any bill that would undermine the Hyde Amendment or any other pro-life protections.
“We are united in our resolve to guard against any changes to Federal law that would unsettle nearly half a century of bipartisan consensus against taxpayer funding for abortion on demand, or otherwise threaten the lives of unborn children,”  the letter read in part. “Accordingly, we are committed to vote against the advancement of any legislation that would eliminate or weaken the Hyde Amendment or any other current-law pro-life protections, or otherwise undermine existing Federal pro-life policy.”  
This letter is endorsed by Susan B. Anthony List, Family Research Council, March for Life, U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, National Right to Life, Heritage Action, Concerned Women for America, Americans United for Life, Live Action, Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, the Center for Family and Human Rights, Eagle Forum, and Students for Life of America.
Rep. Jim Banks (R-Ind.)  led the effort in the U.S. House of Representatives to send a letter to congressional leaders with 200 signatures in support of protecting the Hyde Amendment and other pro-life protections.
For a full list of signatories on the letter,  click here.    
Read the  full letter here or below:
Dear Leader Schumer: 
We believe in the value of every child. Each precious child should be honored by our nation and protected by our laws. 
The Hyde Amendment is the law of the land, as has been so since 1976. The Hyde Amendment has enjoyed decades of bipartisan support, including from then-Senator Joe Biden, and has been signed into law by Democrat and Republican Presidents alike. We are deeply opposed to efforts to allow taxpayer funding of abortion on demand and eliminate this more than four-decade-old consensus. Instead, we urge you to allow the Senate to continue its long tradition of bipartisan cooperation in enacting annual appropriations, as well as other health-related spending, with longstanding pro-life protections intact. 
Abortion is not health care; rather, it is a brutal procedure that destroys the life of an innocent unborn child. The Hyde Amendment reflects a consensus that millions of pro-life Americans who are profoundly opposed to abortion should not be coerced into paying for it or incentivizing it with their taxpayer dollars. A substantial majority of the American public agrees. A 2021 Marist poll found that nearly six in ten Americans, including even more than a third of those who identify as pro-choice, oppose the use of their taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions. Most importantly, the Hyde Amendment saves lives. Analysis by the Charlotte Lozier Institute estimates that over 2.4 million Americans owe their lives to the Hyde Amendment, and it routinely saves more than 60,000 lives every year. 
In addition to preserving the Hyde Amendment’s inclusion in the annual Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations Act, it is equally important that the Senate maintain all other longstanding pro-life protections in Federal law. These include, but are not limited to, prohibitions on funding for abortion and abortion coverage for the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program, the Federal Bureau of Prisons, as well as foreign aid due to the Helms Amendment. Other longstanding pro-life provisions prevent the District of Columbia from funding elective abortions, prohibit the destruction of human embryos in federally funded research, prohibit funding for abortion-related lobbying overseas, as well as protect the conscience rights of Americans opposed to abortion. 
We are united in our resolve to guard against any changes to Federal law that would unsettle nearly half a century of bipartisan consensus against taxpayer funding for abortion on demand, or otherwise threaten the lives of unborn children. Accordingly, we are committed to vote against the advancement of any legislation that would eliminate or weaken the Hyde Amendment or any other current-law pro-life protections, or otherwise undermine existing Federal pro-life policy.

Dear Friend,
  
Due to improving COVID-19 case numbers and ICU capacity, Governor Newsom ended the Regional Stay-at-Home Order on January 26th, 2021. While we seem to have turned a corner in our fight against COVID-19, it is imperative we continue to take precautions like mask wearing and social distancing, and get the vaccine as soon as you're eligible.
 
Our communities still need critical assistance to make it through this pandemic. President Biden's American Rescue Plan is the aid we need to support our communities, including accelerating the vaccine distribution, supporting the reopening of schools and businesses, and providing another round of direct payments.

I understand that many residents are understandably concerned and confused by the ongoing vaccine distribution process. On January 26, California State Government released a new tier system based on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which can be found here.
 
At this time, California has opened vaccine availability to include those 65 and older and healthcare workers. However, due to vaccine shortages and current distribution issues, Central Coast counties continue to prioritize health care workers and individuals aged 75 and older. Please keep in mind that vaccine distribution varies by county.
 
Below is some information on current vaccine distribution for our communities
  
 
SAN LUIS OBISPO
 
Make an appointments here, where you can also find more information about SLO County vaccine distribution.
 
Sign up to be notified of new appointments and eligibility changes here. Appointments for the following week will be added every Thursday. However, the County recommends checking every weekday at 9am for new slots.
 
Once SLO County finishes vaccinating those 75 and older, then adults 65 and older and some frontline workers, will become eligible.
  
 
SANTA BARBARA
 
Find detailed information regarding Santa Barbara County's vaccine distribution and make an appointment here.
 
If there are no appointments available or you are not eligible yet, you can sign up for updates here. If you are age 65-74, please be patient. You will be eligible to be vaccinated in the next few weeks and will receive information from your local health care provider at that time.
  
 
VENTURA
 
Ventura County residents can find the most up-to-date information or make an appointment here. If there are no appointments available or you are not eligible to receive your vaccine at this time, you can sign up to receive updates when appointments are available here.
  
 
LEGISLATIVE UPDATES
 
  
We are now a month into the 117th Congress and I want to update you on important legislation I have introduced so far.
 
California Clean Coast Act - On the 52nd anniversary of the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill, I reintroduced the California Clean Coast Act to ban oil drilling off the Coast of California and protect our coastal economies. Read more here.
 
Califronia Land Preservation Act - I introduced the California Land Protection Act to halt new oil and gas leasing on federal lands without thorough environmental reviews.
 
Honoring Frontline Essential Workers - Essential frontline workers have been at the center of the COVID-19 pandemic by keeping America running, often at great personal risk. On February 2nd, I introduced a resolution to recognize their hard work and makes a recommitment to meet their safety needs. Read more about the resolution here.
 
Protect Patriot Parents Act - On January 28th, I reintroduced my bill to prevent the parents of servicemembers from being deported. Learn more about the legislation and Juana's story here.
  
I know this continues to be a very difficult time for our community. I thank you all for taking the necessary precautions to keep yourself, family, and neighbors safe. We will get through this together.

2/5/21 14:18,Randy's Roundup: Getting Our National Debt Under Control,"
￼
￼
￼

Dear Friend,

This week, I had the honor of giving my first speeches on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. It’s clear that Congress can learn a lot from how we do things in Iowa, especially when it comes to balancing a budget and abiding by responsible budgeting principles. One of the many issues I will continue to prioritize throughout my time in Congress is getting our federal debt under control.
￼

FIRST FLOOR SPEECH

Tuesday evening, I gave my first speech on the floor of the House opposing the Democrats' attempt to fast track what's poised to be one of the largest spending bills in history. This is YOUR money, taxpayer money, and it's being spent with no accountability or transparency. All Iowans and Americans deserve to have a voice in this process.

Click Here or below to watch my full speech 
￼
￼

STANDING UP FOR FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE POLICIES

﻿I also spoke on Wednesday during debate on the House Democrats’ budget framework, which paves the way for another drastic increase in our national debt. Democrats are saddling our children, and even our grandchildren, with debt by attempting to pass a laundry list of progressive policies -- including a minimum wage hike that will destroy jobs in rural Iowa and bailout poorly managed coastal states -- and calling it ""COVID relief."" As a member of the House Committee on the Budget, I'll always stand up for American taxpayers and fiscally responsible policies.

Traveling the district, meeting with Iowans, and taking your concerns to Congress will always be a top priority. Last week, I had the privilege of visiting the Siouxland Community Health Center in Sioux City, SmithCo. Side Dump Trailers in Le Mars, Arnold Motor Supply in Spencer, and a food bank in Sibley. I enjoyed learning about their operations and look forward to touring the district throughout my time in Congress!

Representing Texas on the House Agriculture Committee
￼
￼
￼
￼
I'm excited to announce I'm joining the House Agriculture Committee! The committee maintains jurisdiction relating to the U.S. agriculture industry, trade, and markets, as well as food transparency, forestry, nutrition, conservation, and rural development. I'm honored to be the only Texas Republican on the Agriculture Committee. I look forward to helping develop policy that can support our agricultural industry and life in rural communities. I will work to ensure people in overlooked places have a strong voice in Washington. 

Farming and ranching are essential to our country’s success. There could be no more basic national security issue than to ensure a sustainable and affordable food supply. America’s farmers and ranchers face unique challenges, including high cost of production, a shrinking workforce, natural disasters and burdensome federal regulations. We must work to ensure favorable economic conditions necessary for U.S. agriculture workers to flourish here at home and open up trade opportunities abroad. We have also seen how detrimental it can be when essential supplies are based elsewhere. We must work to ensure the most basic security — a U.S. based food supply — while finding new opportunities for export around the world.

The agriculture industry not only contributes to local, state, and national economies but also promotes international diplomacy. While countries like China work to undermine the United States’ interests, the U.S. can and will use American agriculture to strengthen ties to our allies. The export of American agricultural products plays a critical role in the nation’s economy, and strong trade agreements provide good-paying jobs and higher revenues for farmers and ranchers. I helped lead the effort to pass the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) as a part of the USMCA Task Force.

Trade policy has a real-life impact on the lives and work of our farmers and ranchers in South Texas, so we are going to keep working for strong international trade agreements.

The House Steering Committee recommends this assignment, and it will go before the House Republican Conference to be ratified. Subcommittee assignments have yet to be announced.

Fox Business Interview: Mornings with Maria
￼
￼
￼
￼
There are certainly a number of policy issues that could gain bipartisan support and help the American people. However, the Biden Administration has so far been more interested in partisan actions that undo much of the great progress our country has made. 

Already in the first week, we have seen executive actions that are counterproductive to a secure border or encouraging healthy, legal immigration. 

Meanwhile, Big Tech is colluding to suppress free speech. I question the motives of companies that permit the Chinese Communist Party to freely post but limit Americans.

I joined Mornings with Maria to discuss these issues. Watch the interview HERE or check out this Newsmax article summarizing the interview. 
￼

Standing Up for the Preborn
￼
￼
￼
￼
After eight years of hostility toward the preborn under the Obama administration, the last four years were a breath of fresh air for pro-life Americans. Planned Parenthood chose to walk away from Title X funds in order to continue committing abortions due to a Trump administration rule change, and for the first time in history, a sitting U.S. President spoke at a pro-life march in Washington. 
 
While the Biden Administration is working to roll back much of the progress pro-lifers have made over the last four years, we will persevere. Now more than ever, it is important to hold the line and stand for life. That’s why the first bill I introduced in the 117th Congress is a pro-life bill advocating for the preborn and their pregnant mothers in need. 

The Women’s Public Health and Safety Act will ensure that states have the right to exclude abortion facilities from receiving their Medicaid dollars. This Act will empower states to end the bankrolling of abortion providers and free up funding for healthcare initiatives for those providers which put the wellbeing of women and babies first. You can read more about my bill HERE. 

My thoughts and support are with the folks throughout the country who continue to hold the line for the pro-life movement and the preborn. We will not give up the fight for life!

Bringing Texas National Guard Troops Stationed at U.S. Capitol Home
￼
￼
￼
￼
I was shocked to see pictures and read reports of the National Guardsmen stationed at the U.S. Capitol being moved from indoors out into the garages. I will continue to monitor this situation and encourage an investigation into the matter. Now that their mission is over, I fully endorse Governor Abbott's decision to bring the Texas National Guard troops back to Texas.

Brady Announces Winner of Congressional App Challenge
 
 
Today, Congressman Kevin Brady announced that Jack Pittenger, a Sophomore at The Woodlands College Park High School, is the winner of the Congressional App Challenge for the Eighth Congressional district of Texas. 
 
“Congratulation, Jack!” said Congressman Kevin Brady. “Each year, thousands of students from across the country submit their original app ideas for a chance to win the Challenge for their district, and being selected is a prestigious honor. Already, the Texas JSA division leader has shown a great interest in your app. Well done, and I have no doubt you have big plans for the future.”
 
￼
Jack Pittenger with The Woodlands College Park High School Principle Dr. Mark A. Murrell
 
Jack’s winning app, JSA Vote, was inspired by his experience participating in the Junior State of America's Winter Congress convention. When he noticed that there wasn’t an effective way to vote after debates, he decided to solve the problem. By focusing on online, room-based voting methods, Jack was able to create an app that allows for intuitive and straightforward ballot collection.

WEEK IN REVIEW

COMMITTEE UPDATE 
Week in Review
After a great week at home in the western UP, I was busy in Washington this week voting, working on new legislation, and reintroducing bills we had begun working on in the 116th Congress. Yesterday, I was joined by my Democrat colleague Rep. Ed Case and 32 other Members, to send a letter to President Biden asking him to address the growing national debt by establishing a modern-day Grace Commission, which would root out government waste and inefficiencies. Americans deserve a government that can multi-task. We can address both the economic issues brought on by the coronavirus and our mounting national debt.  I've worked on legislation that focuses on our debt over the past few years in Congress - requesting a reconvening of the Grace Commission can be a much needed additional step for Congress and the Executive Branch to find a path forward to end government waste and address our looming debt problem.  Earlier this week, I voted in opposition to H.Con.Res.11, a budget resolution that will ultimately be used to force through a partisan stimulus bill. While I support some of the proposed relief measures individually - such as further investment in vaccine distribution and an additional $1,400 in direct stimulus for individuals - this bill paves the way for far more government overreach, new burdensome rules and regulations on small businesses, a blanket minimum wage increase, and nearly $2 trillion in coronavirus spending while recent reports have shown that over $1.3 trillion in previous relief dollars has gone unspent. This is irresponsible and reckless governing, and Americans deserve a far better plan from Congress that provides targeted relief and bipartisan agreement.  Thank you for taking the time to read today's update. I look forward to seeing you soon.  Respectfully,   Jack Bergman

Bergman Cosponsors Bill to Address Bureaucratic Waste and the Rising Cost of Debt Payments 
Earlier this week, Rep. Jack Bergman became an original cosponsor of H.R. 638, the Cost Estimates Improvement Act. This legislation would require the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to include the cost of servicing the public debt into any cost estimate analysis of legislation that they conduct. The bill would also require the CBO and JCT to list any federal agencies or programs with overlapping missions as those covered by any bill they analyze. By identifying bureaucratic inefficiencies and better understanding the true cost of spending while in debt, this bill will help lawmakers make sound fiscal choices for the federal government.
Bergman Joins Colleagues in Support of Domestic Steel Industry
On Monday, Rep. Bergman joined with 50 other Members of Congress in sending a bipartisan letter to President Biden requesting the continuation of programs supporting the domestic steel industry. For years, US steel producers have faced unfair trade practices and illegal dumping from foreign competitors. With the economy continuing to feel the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent shutdowns, it’s more important than ever that we promote American workers and manufacturers.

Bergman Original Cosponsor of the VETS Safe Travel Act
Rep. Bergman today joined his colleagues in introducing the Veterans Expedited TSA Screening Safe Travel Act. This bill would waive Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) PreCheck®  fees for severely injured or disabled Veterans. Veterans will still have to complete the application process to enter the TSA PreCheck®  program, which  would grant them expedited security screenings at TSA checkpoints. A similar benefit is currently offered to Active Duty, Reserves, and National Guard servicemembers. 
Bergman Helps Introduce No Vote No Raise Act
Each year since 2010, Republican and Democrat-controlled Congresses have inserted language in appropriations bills to freeze the statutory cost-of-living adjustment for Member salaries. This pay raise for Members of Congress is ‘automatic’ unless acted upon. Thankfully, Rep. Bergman has led and joined efforts to block this pay raise each year.  Now, he is an original cosponsor of the No Vote No Raise Act, which would stop the automatic salary increase for Members of Congress – requiring any such action to come to a vote in Congress instead of being hidden in a large spending bill.  Read more here

2/5/21 15:30,Community-driven conservation,"￼
February 5, 2021
Dear Friend,
New Mexicans know how critical it is to conserve the lands and waters that sustain our way of life. That's why I am so proud to partner with local communities in northern New Mexico and Senator Ben Ray Luján to reintroduce three important conservation bills for northern New Mexico. Two bills would prevent harmful mining operations in the upper Pecos watershed and the Buffalo Tract in Sandoval County. The third would designate a new Cerro de la Olla Wilderness within the Rio Grande del Norte National Monument.
I hope you can take a moment to read and share the article below from today's Santa Fe New Mexican on my legislation. I encourage you to write to me about this and other important priorities.
Sincerely,
￼
MARTIN HEINRICH United States Senator

Sen. Heinrich reintroduces three conservation bills 
By Scott Wyland swyland@sfnewmexican.com Feb 4, 2021
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat, is reintroducing three conservation bills with the hope they will gain traction under a bluer Senate and the Biden administration.
Heinrich is jump-starting bills to restrict hard-rock mining in the Pecos watershed, bar mining on four federal sites in Sandoval County and designate a section of a national monument as a wilderness area.
He said the bills had already stood a good chance of being enacted into law even under a GOP-controlled Senate and the Trump administration because of the hearty community support behind them.
But the measures should really gain steam under the new political dynamic, he said in an interview this week.
He added, ""The majority definitely improves our chances to move it in this Congress.""
Introducing these bills early allows him to take advantage of the favorable political shift, Heinrich said.
But he noted Democrats have only a narrow Senate majority, so it will require working with Republicans to create a bipartisan package. ""And I feel good about being able to make the case for any of these bills to be in such a package.""
The Pecos bill would prevent the leasing, patent and sale of all publicly owned minerals in the watershed, including oil and gas, gold, silver, copper and other hard-rock minerals.
It was crafted in response to a community outcry over Comexico LLC, based in Fort Collins, Colo., looking to explore mineral deposits in the area.
Prospective hard-rock mining in the area called up bad memories of a disastrous toxic waste spill from a closed mine in the 1990s that killed fish for 11 miles in the Pecos River.
The spill created a cancer-causing plume in the water, damaged crops along the river and cost taxpayers millions of dollars to clean up, said Lela McFerrin, vice president of the Upper Pecos Watershed Association.
""These are the issues we are concerned about,"" said McFerrin, who supports Heinrich's bill. ""There's only pockets of clean water in this world now, and this is one of them.""
Comexico is a subsidiary of New World Resources, based in Australia, and has no stake in any harmful effects that mining might have on the river or the community, said Ralph Vigil, chairman of the New Mexico Acequia Association.
""It doesn't tie into what we are going today,"" said Vigil, who noted the area's economy is based on farming and outdoor recreation, not mining.
Heinrich's proposed mining ban on federal lands in Sandoval County is in response to the Bureau of Land Management opening the Buffalo Tract to gravel mining in 2012.
Residents worried that gravel operations would cause health risks and degrade the land, Heinrich said.
Sandoval County, the town of Bernalillo, the Merced De Comunidad De San Antonio De Las Huertas, the Pueblo of San Felipe, the Pueblo of Santa Ana and Placitas residents are opposed to gravel mining.
Heinrich introduced this legislation in 2016. It passed by a voice vote during a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing.
Aside from barring mineral development on the four lands, including the Buffalo Tract and Crest of Montezuma, it would keep the lands under federal management.
The third bill would designate Cerro de la Olla as a wilderness area. It's already part of the Rio Grande del Norte National Monument, and making it a wilderness would prevent road building there, Heinrich said.
People in this area near Taos have hunted, gathered herbs and collected firewood for generations around Cerro de la Olla, Heinrich said.
The proposed legislation, backed by community members, nonprofit groups and tribes, would preserve the traditional land uses while protecting critical habitat for elk, bears and other wildlife, he said.
Vigil said the wilderness destination would be good for the people in that area.
""If we don't take care of the land that provides us life, there's not going to be anything left for anybody,"" he said.

Gosar Introduces Veterans Expedited TSA Screening (VETS) Safe Travel Act
 
 
WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, U.S. Representative Paul Gosar, D.D.S. (AZ-04) released the following statement after introducing the bipartisan Veterans Expedited TSA Screening (VETS) Safe Travel Act. This legislation would provide expedited security screening under the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) PreCheck® program to severely injured or disabled veterans.
Supported by the Wounded Warrior Project, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Disabled American Veterans & The Honor Flight Network
“The bravery and sacrifice of our veterans reminds us that freedom is never truly free. My gratitude for their service to our country cannot be fully expressed by words alone. To protect my most patriotic constituents from harassment and fees while traveling to war memorials, today I reintroduced the VETS Safe Travel Act, which would provide TSA PreCheck free of charge to disabled veterans. I hope that this bipartisan legislation can eliminate many of the challenges disabled veterans face when traveling through our nation’s airports. No American veteran, particularly disabled veterans, should be hassled while traveling this free country,” said Congressman Paul Gosar. 
“Wounded Warrior Project believes that if enacted, the VETS Safe Travel Act will provide many severely injured and disabled veterans a more dignified experience when passing through airport security,” stated the Wounded Warrior Project. 
“Navigating the air travel process is already difficult enough for catastrophically disabled veterans. The VETS Safe Travel Act would provide a great benefit to Paralyzed Veterans of America members by significantly improving their airport security screening experience,” stated Paralyzed Veterans of America.
“As many of our members have attested through the years, navigating airport security can be an extraordinary challenge for veterans with prosthetics or mobility devices. DAV enthusiastically supports the VETS Safe Travel Act and hopes to see it passed and signed into law to help make air travel easier and less stressful for our nation’s severely injured veterans. We appreciate the leadership of Rep. Gosar for introducing this important legislation,” stated Disabled American Veterans. 
Original Cosponsors (24): Rep. Julia Brownley (CA-26); Rep. Ralph Norman (SC-05); Rep. Gerry Connolly (VA-11); Rep. Mike Thompson (CA-05); Rep. Greg Steube (FL-17); Rep. Doug LaMalfa (CA-01); Rep. Michael Waltz (FL-06); Rep. Andy Biggs (AZ-05); Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (DE-At Large); Rep. Dusty Johnson (SD-At Large); Rep. Diana Harshbarger (TN-01); Rep. Jerry Carl (AL-01); Rep. Seth Moulton (MA-06); Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (WA-05); Rep. Fred Keller (PA-12); Rep. Jack Bergman (MI-01); Rep. Lou Correa (CA-46); Rep. Trent Kelly (MS-01); Rep. Conor Lamb (PA-17); Rep. Chrissy Houlahan (PA-06); Rep. Elissa Slotkin (MI-08); Rep. Michael San Nicolas (Guam-At Large); Rep. Greg Pence (IN-06); Rep. Mike Gallagher (WI-08)
Background:
There are approximately 70,000 veterans with an amputation and over 130,000 veterans who are legally blind in the United States. When many travel through airport security with their wheelchair, prosthetics, or other assistive devices, it can be challenging. Under this legislation, the Department of Veterans Affairs would certify that a veteran is severely injured and therefore eligible to apply for TSA PreCheck® free of charge. TSA would process the veteran’s application, granting access to TSA PreCheck® provided they successfully pass the background check and interview process. This benefit is similar to what is already offered to Active Duty, Reserves, and National Guard servicemembers.

Dear Friends, 
 
As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to take lives and impact livelihoods, I know that many of you are struggling amidst the weight of these challenges. I've always said we cannot let our communities weather this crisis alone. That has never been more true than right now. That's why, this week, the Congress passed a budget resolution to pave the way for a landmark coronavirus rescue plan. The American people cannot afford any more delays, we know that and are determined to get this relief in the hands of Americans as quickly as possible. I've spoken to many of you over the last few weeks, and am keeping all Coloradans in mind as we work through the legislative process in Washington D.C. and work to pass a robust, comprehensive package that will meet the scale of this crisis. 
 
FIGHTING FOR COVID RELIEF 
 
￼
I am fighting for immediate and direct stimulus checks for American families, support for local businesses and communities, and funds to support our food banks and nutrition assistance programs. I believe all of these pieces, among others, will be crucial to restarting our economy and supporting working families. Additionally, we are working to provide funds to ramp up vaccine distribution and ensure our communities and states have the resources they need to get  
shots in the arms of Americans as quickly as possible. I am honored to be tasked with fighting for Coloradans and to ensure the next COVID relief bill we pass will adequately address the problems facing our district, our state, and our county. 
 
IT'S TIME TO ENACT THE CORE ACT INTO LAW
 
To build a stronger Colorado, we must recognize what makes us who we are. As Coloradans, outdoor spaces and recreation are part of our way of life. Whether you’re a skier, a snowboarder, a mountain biker, or a hiker like myself, our public lands play a crucial role in the identity of our state.
 
Because of this, myself and Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper have reintroduced the Colorado Outdoor Recreation
￼
and Economy Act, or the CORE Act. The CORE Act will protect over 400,000 acres of public land in Colorado, establish new wilderness areas, and safeguard existing outdoor recreation opportunities to boost the economy for future generations. The CORE Act will also establish the first-ever National Historic Landscape at Camp Hale to honor the legacy of the Army’s 10th Mountain Division. 
 
I introduced the CORE Act in the 116th Congress, where it passed the House twice with bipartisan support and I am thrilled to be working with Senators Bennet and Hickenlooper to ensure its passage in the 117th Congress for it to be signed into law by President Biden.

2/5/21 15:47,Reflecting On The Past Week,"￼

February 5, 2021
Dear  Lindsey,
 
This was a difficult week for our community.
 
I was stunned and heartbroken by the Rochester Police Department body camera footage released over the weekend. A child—especially one who is clearly in distress—should never be treated that way, let alone by the very people who are supposed to keep her safe.
 
RPD’s response to this young girl lacked empathy, understanding, and basic common-sense—and if that is what “protocol” looks like, it’s simply unacceptable.
 
This child was failed at every level of response to this incident. We need real, meaningful action to truly change our police culture and government protocols. Last year, I co-sponsored the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act that banned chokeholds and I will be taking action to ban the use of pepper spray and chemical agents on minors by law enforcement. Our children and our communities deserve better.

Dear fellow East Tennesseans,

This week was my first full week in session in Washington, D.C. I’m excited to share updates from this busy week and important information you might find helpful below. Please consider following me on Facebook and Twitter to stay informed. And if there’s anything my office can assist with, please visit my website and contact us. 
 
IN THE NEWS
Rep. Diana Harshbarger to Newsmax TV: Biden's Abortion Policies 'Unconscionable'

CONGRESSWOMAN HARSHBARGER VOTES AGAINST PARTISAN BUDGET RESOLUTION, CALLS FOR TARGETED PANDEMIC RELIEF
This week, I voted against the partisan budget proposal that favored bailouts for fiscally reckless states over targeted relief for Americans suffering from the ill effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Read my full statement here. I also signed a letter to urge President Biden to use unspent COVID relief money from previous stimulus bills before considering another enormous spending bill.

￼

CONGRESSWOMAN HARSHBARGER SPEAKS ABOUT THE SANCTITY OF LIFE ON THE HOUSE FLOOR
On Wednesday, I joined many of my colleagues to speak on the House floor to speak on the importance of defending life. Watch my full speech here.

CONGRESSWOMAN HARSHBARGER’S FIRST COMMITTEE HEARING
This week, I participated in my first hearing as a member of the House Committee on Homeland Security where we discussed domestic terrorism threats and the need for a commission to look into the unanswered questions following the events on January 6th at the U.S. Capitol. I look forward to future hearings about how we can best improve our national security. 
￼

CONGRESSWOMAN HARSHBARGER MEETS WITH MEMBERS OF ‘IN DEFENSE OF CHRISTIANS’ ORGANIZATION
I had the pleasure of meeting with Toufic Baaklini and members of ‘In Defense of Christians’ to discuss international religious freedom and legislation that would help protect endangered Christians in the Middle East.

CONGRESSWOMAN HARSHBARGER SIGNS ON TO LEGISLATION TO BLOCK GUANTANAMO DETAINEES FROM RECEIVING THE COVID VACCINE BEFORE AMERICANS
This week, I signed on to two pieces of legislation opposing efforts to give the COVID-19 vaccine to detainees at Guantanamo Bay before American citizens. H.Res.81 and H.R.758 would ensure that Americans receive the vaccine before terrorists.

IMPORTANT COVID RELIEF CHECK INFORMATION
If you’re eligible for a COVID stimulus relief check and have not yet received it, it may be because you need to file a 2020 tax return to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit. You have a few options on how to do this, according to the IRS:
	•	You can use one of the IRS Free File partners to electronically file a 2020 tax return and claim your credit; or
	•	In early February, you can use the IRS’ Volunteer Income Tax Return Locator tools to find somewhere local to get free tax help; or
	•	Or, you can file a paper Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR and claim the credit on line 30. The Instructions for Forms 1040 and 1040-SR provide information starting on page 57 on how to compute your credit.

TENNESSEE COVID-19 VACCINE DISTRIBUTION UPDATES
	•	This week, Tennessee began issuing vaccines to adults aged 70 and over. 
	•	The Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) is also expanding access to vaccines with a particular focus on rural and underserved areas. TDH is partnering with pharmacies and community health clinics to add more than 100 new vaccination sites across the state. The new vaccination sites for pharmacies can be found here and community health clinics here. 
	•	For detailed information on vaccine availability and other COVID-19 resources in Tennessee, check out the state’s website, covid19.tn.gov. The site is updated daily, and you can check on vaccine availability, which populations are currently being served, and register for appointments in counties that offer them. 
	•	You can find county-specific vaccine information here. 

GET A FASTER FEDERAL TAX REFUND WITH DIRECT DEPOSIT
I wanted to pass along a message from the IRS: the fastest way to get your tax refund is by filing electronically and choosing direct deposit. Direct deposit is free, fast, simple, safe and secure. Taxpayers can even split their refund to have it deposited into one, two or three different accounts. Check out the IRS website for more information. 

KINGSPORT OFFICE INFORMATION
I want to make sure everyone has the information for my new Kingsport office. Drop by or give us a call if we can ever be of assistance. Our address is 205 Revere St., Kingsport, TN, 37660, and our phone number is (423) 398-5186.

Dear Lindsey Cormack,
Each February, as we celebrate Black History Month, we take time to honor the incredible contributions and achievements Black Americans have made throughout history, especially here at home in North Carolina. These stories reflect the resilience, talent, and strength that challenge our nation to live up to its full potential for every American. 
We celebrate Black leaders like North Carolina’s Ella Baker, a renowned Civil Rights activist who founded the Student Non-Violence Coordinating Committee at Shaw University in Raleigh, world famous singer, Nina Simone, and literary icon, Maya Angelou.
The Fourth District is home to John C. Merrick, born into slavery, who established the North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company in 1898 and later moved its headquarters to downtown Durham. The Mutual Life Insurance Company served Black businesses and set the foundation for a flourishing business district, commonly referred to as Durham’s “Black Wall Street”. Merrick was succeeded by Dr. Aaron McDuff Moore, who was previously the only Black physician in Durham and founded Lincoln Hospital to serve the area’s local Black population. Later, Charles C. Spaulding's adept leadership quickly made the company the largest Black-owned business in America. This history shows how Durham’s Black residents created a thriving community even in the face of seemingly insurmountable racist laws in the Jim Crow South.
On February 1, 1960, Black students at North Carolina A&T University in Greensboro sparked the sit-in movement for desegregation across the country. Within the month, nine Chapel Hill high school students sat-in at counters where they were refused service and arrested, paving the way for years of civil rights struggle and eventually desegregation. The story of the “Chapel Hill Nine” and other important civil rights figures are documented in the Chapel Hill Library Civil Rights Timeline.
While we’ve made progress toward a fairer, more just society, this past year has underscored the work that remains unfinished. The January 6th attack on the Capitol served as a stark reminder of how dangerous the forces of white supremacy remain. Over the course of the past year, our nation also witnessed the systemic racism and institutional violence that led to the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, David McAtee, Daniel Prude, the injury of Jacob Blake, and countless other Black Americans. Historic demonstrations for Black lives cried out for justice and for recognition that our nation’s racist roots have nurtured persistent inequality, but meaningful change remains unacceptably slow.
All of these recent events have occurred in the shadow of COVID-19 which has exacerbated existing inequalities, disproportionately impacting health outcomes, housing accessibility, food security, and access to other necessities in Black and communities of color. 
Black History Month serves as a reminder that the difficult work for equal rights is continuous and we must renew our commitment to equity and justice for all African Americans. Black history is American history, and we must draw on the values we share as Americans to chart a better, more just path forward.
I hope you take time this month to explore North Carolina’s Black History from the safety of your home. You can do so by clicking the links below.

2/5/21 16:28,Financial Security for American Families.,"￼
￼    February 1 - February 5, 2021 
This week, Senator Romney unveiled his proposal, the Family Security Act, to create a new national commitment to American families by providing them with greater financial security. The Senator also joined colleagues in introducing a compromise COVID-19 relief proposal and subsequently met with the President and Vice President at the White House to discuss the details of their proposal. Senator Romney's TRUST Act also picked up tremendous bipartisan support during debate on the Senate's budget resolution. Keep scrolling for more updates from the week. 
￼
  American families are facing greater financial strain, worsened by the COVID-19 pandemic, and marriage and birth rates are at an all-time low. On top of that, we have not comprehensively reformed our family support system in nearly three decades, and our changing economy has left millions of families behind. Senator Romney's Family Security Act offers a path toward greater security for America’s families by consolidating the many complicated programs to create a monthly cash benefit for them, without adding to the deficit. The monthly cash benefit would amount to $350 a month for each young child, and $250 a month for each school-aged child.   The Family Security Act would also cut child poverty by up to one-third in America; support families from pregnancy through childhood; promote marriage; and provide equal treatment for both working and stay-at-home parents. More information on Senator Romney's proposal can be found here.  
￼
  Full story by David Wells here.   
￼
  Full story by Robert Verbruggen here.    ￼    Senator Romney filed 11 amendments to the Senate budget resolution for fiscal year 2021 aimed at addressing the range of challenges Utah and the nation face, including providing greater financial security for American families, ensuring clean water for Utah’s Navajo Nation, supporting energy leasing on federal lands, and bolstering U.S. national security. More information on these amendments can be found here.  During consideration of the budget resolution last night, the Senate overwhelmingly adopted Senator Romney's amendment aimed at rescuing endangered federal trust funds. It’s reckless to ignore the impending insolvency of these funds and the COVID-19 pandemic has only accelerated our fiscal problems—requiring us to borrow trillions of dollars to get through the pandemic. Senator Romney's measure, cosponsored by 10 Republicans and Democrats, is based on his TRUST Act, which would create a process for Congress to develop solutions to save the government’s biggest, most important programs related to transportation, health care, and financial security.   
￼
   
￼
  The first five COVID-19 relief packages were done on a bipartisan basis—and the next one should follow suit. Senator Romney joined nine Republican colleagues to propose a relief package that is capable of garnering bipartisan support, as an alternative to the administration's $1.9 trillion plan. Their plan includes increased funding for the production and distribution of vaccines; targeted economic relief for Americans with the greatest need; extended and enhanced federal unemployment benefits; and additional assistance for small businesses. Senator Romney and the group had a productive meeting with the President and Vice President at the White House, where they detailed their proposal. The group is continuing discussions with colleagues and the administration on areas of common ground.  
￼
  
￼
  
￼
  Full story by Mori Kessler here.   
￼
  With some of the highest COVID-19 infection rates in the country, the Navajo Nation faces a dire situation—due in large part to a lack of water infrastructure and sanitation facilities. This week, Senator Romney teamed up with Senator Sinema (D-AZ) to introduce bipartisan legislation to authorize the construction and renovation of water and sewer sanitation facilities in Native communities in Utah and throughout the country.  
￼
  Full story by Kyle Dunphey here.  
￼
  Senator Romney announced his four committee assignments for the 117th Congress, saying: “Action is essential if we are to overcome the challenges facing our families, our state, and our nation. My committee assignments for this Congress will enable me to work directly on several key policy areas.” His committee assignments include the Foreign Relations; Health, Education, Labor & Pensions; Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs, and Budget committees.

Rep. Loudermilk on Newsmax TV discussing Pelosi's handling of COVID relief and Rep. Greene
 

 
 
Press Release: Rep. Loudermilk on Resolution to Remove Congresswoman Greene from Committees
 
 
Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga) issued the following statement after the House voted on H.Res. 72: 

“While I disagree with many comments made by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, especially those she made before she was an elected member of Congress, this motion by Democrats for the House to remove her from her assigned committees is unprecedented, and sets a very dangerous precedent. Just as Nancy Pelosi has twice used impeachment as a tool against a political rival, she is further abusing her power as Speaker to remove a Republican from committees because she does not like some of the things Rep. Greene has said. 

“This action, along with their resolutions to expel Republicans for objecting to the Electoral College count, something the Democrats have done on numerous occasions in past elections, is evidence of the double standard of accountability with Democrats in Washington DC. Whether Washington Democrats, big tech and mainstream media like it or not, First Amendment protections apply to Republicans, as well as Democrats.

The Cherokee Tribune News: 

""District 11 United States Representative Barry Loudermilk made an appearance in Bartow County last week, addressing the political fallout of the Jan. 6 riots in Washington, D.C.

At a Bartow County Republican function on Jan. 30, Loudermilk said he met with several constituents who were in the nation's capital for the now-infamous pro-Trump demonstration. 

'Some of the folks that were there came and visited with us the day before, people that we know and some of you probably know them from Cherokee County, they were up there for the rally,' he said. 'Their plan was to come and stand around the Capitol, as do groups all the time, most of them are usually far-left groups … just to show the strength and support that Trump still had in the nation.' ""

New York Post: 

""The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ closely watched jobs report was slightly weaker than economists’ expectations for a gain of 58,000 jobs, according to Wrightson ICAP. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, fell to 6.3 percent from 6.7 percent in December.

While the job market is once again trudging toward recovery, there’s still a long way to go — the economy has only recovered about 12 million of the 22 million jobs it lost when the pandemic hit last spring, federal data show.""

Foxx Report
 
At its core, effective legislating is carried out by following established procedures, respecting the input from those who hold different positions, and finding common ground for the good of the people. Let the People’s House be a prime example. The rules we follow respect the majority and minority parties so that both sides are represented and that everyone has a seat at the table. Unfortunately, those principles were abandoned this week when Washington Democrats ignored bipartisan input in favor their own approach: quickly rushing their own legislation to the floor and abandoning a committee markup on a controversial bill.
Under the Trump Administration, IRAPS - or Industry Recognized Apprenticeship Programs - were created to provide an avenue for companies seeking skilled workers to develop programs that received input from other industry leaders rather than the federal government. Republicans strongly supported these programs while Democrats argued that the federal government needed a stronger presence in the process. If private sector innovation and career preparation are inherently good things, why would Washington Democrats want more government oversight over them? Well, look no further than the partisan bill they’re peddling now.
Under the so-called National Apprenticeship Act, those apprenticeship programs will be decimated. More specifically, it would strip countless opportunities away from 131 of these programs – a vast majority of which are nursing credentials, in the middle of a public health and workforce crisis. It also pushes workers into unions by favoring grant funding for entities that directly partner with unions and not with separate innovators. Instead of focusing on American innovation, and the flexibility to get more Americans back into work, Washington Democrats are doubling down on an antiquated system that favors union-driven apprenticeships rather than opportunities that make substantial and lasting impacts on America’s workforce.
That’s not what Western North Carolinians want, and frankly it’s not what they deserve. Union-run apprenticeships are dead in the water, and I’ll continue to fight so that those who seek apprenticeships can receive the opportunities they need to build livelihoods they can be proud of.
Important Update on UMATA
This week, I reintroduced the Unfunded Mandates Accountability and Transparency Act for the 117th Congress alongside Senator Rob Portman (R-OH). This bipartisan, bicameral legislation is built off legislation that was originally offered by me and Senator Deb Fischer (R-NE), the Unfunded Mandates Information and Transparency Act. In short, this bill helps uncover the true costs of unfunded federal mandates so that Washington bureaucrats can no longer kick the can down the road at the expense of hardworking taxpayers, the job market, and the great American economy. Congress must always look for opportunities to cut red tape, empower job creators, and strengthen local governments across the country. I’m confident that our legislation will achieve these goals, and I look forward its passage in both the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate.
An Interview You Can’t Miss
Recently, I joined Tony Perkins, the President of the Family Research Council, to speak about President Biden’s attack on the sanctity of human life. In case you have not seen the news, last week President Biden struck down the pro-life Mexico City Policy with the stroke of a pen – effectively undoing the progress we’ve seen to preserve life for the past four years. In short, the Mexico City Policy prohibits federal funding to international organizations that are directly involved in providing and promoting abortion services. As I told Tony, Republicans in Congress understand that life is sacred, and we’ll always be the loudest voice in the room when it comes to fighting for, and defending, the unborn.

2/5/21 16:54,Senator Rick Scott's Week in Review,"￼ 
￼
￼
￼
￼
￼
This week, Senator Rick Scott voted against Senate Democrats’ partisan $2 trillion spending bill that increases America’s crushing national debt and does more to advance wasteful liberal priorities than actually help American families and small businesses. Ahead of the vote, Senator Scott released the statement below.  
Senator Rick Scott said, “Congress is as dysfunctional as ever. Democrats only lasted 10 days before they completely rejected bipartisanship and began their one-sided push for a $2 trillion spending bill. Democrats have moved forward with a wasteful spending bill that would increase our already massive national debt, trigger devastating cuts to Medicare, and hurt the poorest families in our nation the most. Only in Washington does that make sense. So much for the Left’s call for unity.   ""While the process the Democrats have chosen makes absolutely no sense and ultimately hurts American families, I will never stop fighting for Floridians. I am filing a number of amendments to the budget to rein in Washington’s out-of-control spending, protect Americans, secure the border, and get our children back to school."" Read more HERE or in Spanish HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott: Congress Must Address Our National Debt and Rein in Spending

Sen. Rick Scott: Democrats Want to Use COVID-19 Spending Package as Payback to Liberal States 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement about Democrats’ plans to use the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 spending package to bailout wasteful states, like New York, Illinois and California, that want to use taxpayer money to backfill their poorly-managed budgets and pension plans.   Senator Rick Scott said, “Senate Republicans are all in for getting targeted relief to Americans that are still hurting from this pandemic. But President Biden and the Democrats want to spend more than $350 billion to bailout their friends in New York, Illinois, and California. And they are lying about the need for this money. Congress has already given states roughly $400 billion to combat this crisis. States across the country are seeing increases in revenue — in some cases, well above projections. Now, we are learning that 47 states show an average decline of just 0.12 percent compared to 2019, and twenty-one of the 47 states show positive year over year growth of tax receipts. Over half of states reported positive growth, including California, New York, and Illinois.   ""This is great news for our states – but Democrats don’t want you to know this. The Democrats have made it blatantly obvious that this isn’t about helping people – it’s a payback to their friends for helping with their campaigns. Less than two weeks into the Biden Administration and Democrats have already completely abandoned their inauthentic calls for ‘unity’ and ‘bipartisanship’ just to push through massive spending and get tax dollars to their buddies. You can’t make this stuff up. These wasteful states just have their hand out to the federal government in hopes that American taxpayers will plug the long-standing holes in their budgets and pension systems created by decades of mismanagement and the poor decisions of failed politicians. That’s not fair to Floridians and all the states around the country that have been working hard to protect taxpayer dollars. We can’t let it happen."" Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott to OMB: Taxpayers Need Transparency on $4.5 Trillion Allocated for COVID Relief 
Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to the Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requesting an update on the more than $4.5 trillion in tax dollars that has been already allocated to provide financial support to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 crisis. As Congress considers additional COVID-19 relief, Senator Scott is asking that all available information is released regarding tax dollar allocations and spending to make the best decisions for how to move the nation forward.

Senator Rick Scott Leads Colleagues in Resolution Demanding Olympic Committee Move 2022 Olympic Games Out of Communist China 
Senator Rick Scott introduced a resolution calling on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to move the 2022 Winter Olympics out of Communist China and rebid it to another country unless Beijing immediately addresses its egregious and numerous violations of human rights. Senators Mike Braun, Marco Rubio, Todd Young, Tom Cotton, Jim Inhofe, and Marsha Blackburn joined Senator Scott in sponsoring this resolution.  Senator Rick Scott said, “Communist China is committing genocide against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, restricting the human rights of Hong Kongers, and threatening Taiwan. Communist China should not be allowed to host the 2022 Olympic Games while simultaneously running concentration camps, violating human rights and systematically oppressing the people of Hong Kong. The Olympic Games are an incredible opportunity to allow the world’s best athletes to represent their countries and unite our nations, and under no circumstance should be hosted by one of the world’s worst human rights abusers. I am proud to lead my colleagues to send a clear message to the IOC: stand up for freedom and urge Communist China to do the right thing, or find a new home for the 2022 Olympic Games.” Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott Leads Colleagues in Resolution Opposing Reckless Iran Deal 
Senators Rick Scott, Joni Ernst and Kevin Cramer introduced a resolution expressing opposition to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and urging President Biden to work with Congress and refuse to re-join the deal without significant reform.  Senator Rick Scott said, “President Trump was right to abandon the reckless Iran nuclear deal that President Obama got us into, and I’m proud my colleagues joined me today to oppose re-joining this deal without major changes. The sanctions the Trump administration levied on Iran are working, and must remain in place until Iran fully cooperates and their ability to develop nuclear weapons and produce ballistic missiles is permanently removed. President Biden must be responsible about this and work with Congress to protect national security and the interests of America and our great ally Israel."" Read more HERE.

Senators Rick Scott, Marco Rubio and Colleagues Introduce Bill to Get Students Back in School 
Senator Rick Scott joined Senator Marco Rubio and colleagues in introducing the Put Students First Act of 2021, which would prohibit federal funding to schools that do not provide an in-person learning option by April 30, 2021.  Senator Rick Scott said, “Health experts, students and parents agree: schools need to reopen and our kids need to get back to school. The only people who don’t want to open schools are Senate Democrats and the teachers unions that fund their campaigns. That’s wrong. Schools can openly safely and every student should have the option of in-person learning.” Read more from Senator Rubio’s office HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott: IOC Silence on Communist China’s Human Rights Abuses is Shameful 
One year ahead of the start of 2022 Olympic Games, Senator Rick Scott released a statement reiterating his call for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to move the games out of Communist China. To date, the IOC has failed to address Communist China’s horrific human rights abuses, and is instead rewarding General Secretary Xi’s abuses with a “soft power win.”  
Senator Rick Scott said, “For more than a year, I’ve repeatedly called for the IOC to address the genocide occurring under General Secretary Xi’s watch but have been met with nothing but obfuscation. The silence of the IOC on Communist China’s oppression and human rights abuses is shameful. The abuses and genocide against Uyghurs, oppression of Hong Kongers, and aggression toward Taiwan are not unfounded allegations, they are well documented. There is no excuse for the IOC’s cowering to Communist China. It’s time to act and send a clear message that the Olympic Games are about unity and will not be associated with the atrocities General Secretary Xi leads against his own people. The games must be moved now.” Read more HERE.

Senador Rick Scott: El silencio del COI sobre los abusos de los derechos humanos en la China comunista es vergonzoso 
Un año antes del inicio de los Juegos Olímpicos de 2022, el Senador Rick Scott hizo un comunicado reiterando su llamado al Comité Olímpico Internacional (COI) para sacar los juegos de la China comunista. Hasta la fecha, el COI no ha abordado los horribles abusos contra los derechos humanos de la China comunista y, en cambio, está recompensando los abusos del Secretario General Xi con una “victoria de poder blanda”.
El Senador Rick Scott dijo: “Durante más de un año, he pedido repetidamente al COI que aborde el genocidio que ocurrió bajo la supervisión del Secretario General Xi, pero me he encontrado con nada más que indiferencia. El silencio del COI sobre la opresión de la China comunista y los abusos de los derechos humanos es vergonzoso. Los abusos y el genocidio contra los uigures, la opresión de los habitantes de Hong Kong y la agresión hacia Taiwán no son acusaciones infundadas, están bien documentadas. No hay excusa para que el COI se acobarde ante la China comunista. Es hora de actuar y enviar un mensaje claro de que los Juegos Olímpicos tienen que ver con la unidad y no se asociarán con las atrocidades que lleva a cabo el Secretario General Xi contra su propio pueblo. Los juegos deben moverse ya”. Lea más AQUÍ.

Sen. Rick Scott in Fox News: Here’s How Biden’s Big Government Approach Will Hurt Businesses, Workers and Families 
Senator Rick Scott wrote an op-ed for Fox News on how the big government approach of President Biden and his economic policy nominees will hurt American businesses, workers and families.  In the op-ed, Senator Rick Scott wrote, “There have been few other times in American history when the need for economic growth through strategic, responsible, pro-business policies has been as great as it is today. As our nation fights to overcome the horrendous health and economic consequences of COVID-19, we must balance our approach.   … Sadly, President Biden and his economic team think the solution to America’s economic woes is for government to control the economy. That’s wrong and it will only drive us more into debt, ruining the chances for our kids and grandkids to ever make it in our country. We have to remember that individuals and the private sector are the driving force of our nation’s success. Not the government.   This isn’t speculation – it’s obvious in President Biden’s choices for some of our most important leadership positions.   A case in point is Gina Raimondo, the nominee to be secretary of Commerce and former governor of Rhode Island – the worst state in the nation for business. That’s right, one of the most important positions for supporting American economic growth and innovation is going to be filled by someone who oversaw a state with the nation’s third-worst GDP growth rate, the nation’s worst infrastructure and the eighth-highest tax burden.   … In the four years before I was elected governor of Florida unemployment climbed to 10.8%, taxes increased by more than $2 billion, and the state lost more than 800,000 jobs. Over the next eight years, I worked every day to turn Florida around and we saw an incredible recovery from the Great Recession.   … Now, President Biden and his Cabinet have the important task of trying to guide an economic recovery while Democratic mayors still refuse to open up economies and keep businesses and schools shut down.   …It’s time to get real and make hard choices. We cannot continue to mortgage our kids’ and grandkids’ futures with irresponsible and shortsighted spending. President Biden and his Cabinet picks need better answers and American families deserve them now.""   Read the full op-ed in Fox News HERE.

February Update

Hello Neighbor, 

￼
I hope you are well, staying safe, and excited to watch the Kansas City Chiefs bring home another Lombardi Trophy this weekend. A lot has happened in the last few weeks as the 117th Congress has gotten underway, and I wanted to take a moment to send you the latest update from Washington, DC.
Chairing The Financial Services Subcommittee on Housing, Community Redevelopment, and Insurance
Since coming to Congress, my only personal dream was to one day become Chair of the Subcommittee on Housing, Community Redevelopment, and Insurance. As someone who spent the first several years of my life in a shack with no electricity or running water--and then another several years in public housing as my father worked three jobs to save up for our own house--I know firsthand the stability and purpose that affordable housing can bring to working class families. Affordable housing is one of the top 5 issues facing the American people and something that affects tens of thousands of Missourians in my congressional district every day.
That's why I was extraordinarily proud and honored last week to be unanimously appointed by my colleagues on the Financial Services Committee to Chair the Subcommittee on Housing. After spending years as the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee and passing multiple major pieces of housing legislation, including the Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act and COVID-19 Emergency Housing Relief Act, I am ready to tackle the challenge of ensuring every Missouri family has an affordable place to rest their head at night. We have a lot of work to do, but I promise you I will do everything in my power to expand access to affordable housing for working class families and bolster our nation's housing stock.
Congress Passes Budget Resolution Allowing For $1.9 Trillion COVID-19 Relief Package
Since coronavirus came to our shores over a year ago, it has been a formidable foe that has taken over 450,000 of our fellow Americans and devastated our national economy. While previous relief packages passed by Congress have provided a lifeline to Missouri families, workers, and small businesses, more must be done to keep families and businesses afloat. With the January jobs report showing a third-straight month of anemic job growth--and having recovered just over half of the tens of millions of jobs lost since last March--it's clear that we're still clawing out of the hole COVID-19 blew into our economy and that Congress must act urgently to keep us from sliding back into a recession.
This week, Congress passed a Budget Resolution that gives us another tool to ensure a substantial relief package can be passed before the end of February. By passing the budget resolution, we have given ourselves the ability to pass legislation through a procedure called ""Budget Reconciliation."" This is a process that allows Congress to pass a spending bill without having to overcome a filibuster in the Senate--something that was done twice during the Presidency of George W. Bush and once in 2017 under President Trump.
Reconciliation by no means precludes my colleagues across the aisle from working with Democrats to concoct this desperately needed relief package, and I'm hopeful they will do so. However, we cannot allow Washington gridlock to stop us from passing a package that delivers direct payments to families, extends unemployment insurance for workers, funds the distribution of vaccines, provides rental and housing assistance, supports small businesses, and more. For that reason, I supported the budget resolution and will continue pushing for an ambitious relief bill to support Missourians and the American people. You can find more information on my support for this resolution here.
Be Safe and GO CHIEFS!
As I am sure you are well aware, our beloved Kansas City Chiefs will inevitably win their second Lombardi Trophy in as many years this Sunday. Although I have a hard time believing anyone is as excited as I am about this prospect, I know the elation flowing through our city is palpable. I want you to have a fantastic time celebrating our cherished Chiefs this weekend, but I also want to ask you to please follow health guidelines as you do so.
There's nothing quite like watching your favorite team Run It Back with family and friends, but we need to be extra cautious this year to prevent a calamitous string of super spreader Super Bowl watch parties. The last thing I want to see is more of our neighbors and fellow Missourians get sick and potentially hospitalized, so please avoid having gatherings for the big game. I promise you there will be time to celebrate this championship just as we did last year, however, we may have to be a little patient. So please, listen to Dr. Fauci, continue to wear masks, avoid large gatherings, and let's go CHIEFS!
Sincerely,

2/5/21 17:33,Baldwin Takes Action to Combat the Growing Racial Wealth Gap,"

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
Senator Baldwin has helped to reintroduce the American Opportunity Accounts Act, legislation seeking to create a national program commonly referred to as “Baby Bonds.” This groundbreaking bill will create a federally-funded savings account for every American child at birth that will grow each year depending on family income, making economic opportunity a birthright for every American and helping close the racial wealth gap.  The American Opportunity Accounts Act, also known as “Baby Bonds”, will create a new American birthright – giving every child a fair chance at economic opportunity and mobility. The legislation will create and seed a savings account of $1,000 at birth, with additional deposits of up to $2,000 each year, depending on household income. The funds will sit in an interest-bearing account, which can be accessed by account holders at age 18 for allowable uses like buying a home, paying for educational expenses or starting a business. Senator Baldwin joined Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Congresswoman Ayanna Pressley (MA-07) in reintroducing the American Opportunity Accounts Act this week.  
“The growing gap between those at the top and everybody else has been at historic highs and much of the wealth gap is along racial lines. Too many people are being left behind by Washington and we should take bold action to start helping them get ahead by creating economic opportunity for all Americans,” said Senator Baldwin. “Wisconsin’s economy is strongest when we extend and expand opportunity for everyone. This legislation will create upward economic mobility for every child in America. With this investment, we can help close the racial wealth gap and advance racial equity across our economy.” 
“The American Opportunity Accounts Act is one of the most important investments in equity Washington can make to help close the racial wealth gap, increase the net worth of millions of families, and set the next generation up for success,” said Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley. “The Milwaukee metro area has one of the largest wealth gaps in the country, it’s just one of the many disparities that are the legacy of generations of policies that benefited white Americans on the backs of Black Americans, Indigenous peoples, and other people of color. The problem was created by policy in Washington, and now Washington has an opportunity to fix it. The time for change is always now and we can start with swift passage of the American Opportunity Accounts Act.” 
With the American Opportunity Accounts Act, at birth, every American child would be given an “American Opportunity Account” seeded with $1,000. Each year, children would receive up to an additional $2,000 deposit into their American Opportunity Account, depending on family income. These funds would sit in a federally insured account managed by the Treasury Department, achieving roughly 3 percent interest. Account holders may access the money once they reach age 18 and use the funds for allowable uses like homeownership, financing a higher education or starting a small business— the kind of investments that change life trajectories. Recent studies by Columbia University and Morningstar have found that a program like Baby Bonds would substantially close the racial wealth gap in America. 
Read more about the American Opportunity Accounts Act and see why the Black Millennial Convention, Center for Law and Social Policy, Children’s Defense Fund, Color of Change, Environmental Working Group, Faith for Black Lives, First Focus Campaign for Children, LIFT, NAACP, National Alliance of Community Economic Development Associations, National Association for Latino Community Asset Builders, National Coalition for Asian Pacific American Community Development, National Women's Law Center, National Urban League, PolicyLink, Prosperity Now, RESULTS, and The Asset Building Policy Network (as a collective) all endorsed the bill here.

2/5/21 17:33,Senator Murphy COVID-19 Weekly Update: February 5th,"￼
Friend – 
Below please find the Murphy office update on COVID-19. 
As always, if you need assistance, please don’t hesitate to contact our Hartford or Washington, D.C. offices. 
Here’s what you need to know this week: 
	•	This week, Senator Murphy spoke on the U.S. Senate floor to outline the key priorities he wants to see in the next COVID-19 relief bill currently being debated in Congress. While discussing the popularity of President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, Murphy spoke about the need to see more funding to support summer enrichment opportunities, speed up the pace of vaccine production by funding the Defense Production Act, and build up a global pandemic infrastructure to fortify our defenses against any future viruses. Murphy also stressed the broad popularity of the Biden’s American Rescue Plan, which is supported by nearly 7 in 10 Americans. In addition, early this morning, Congress passed legislation that is a first step to bringing additional COVID relief to Connecticut families and communities.
	•	Senator Murphy and Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin introduced legislation to provide a $10 billion investment in rapidly expanding the domestic manufacturing for pandemic supplies. This funding will support President Biden’s executive action and his American Rescue Plan to fully utilize the Defense Production Act to accelerate manufacturing and delivery of medical equipment and supplies needed for our COVID-19 response.
	•	This week, Senator Murphy and Republican Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri re-introduced legislation that allows any health care professional in good standing with a valid practitioners’ license to render services—including telehealth—anywhere for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. Currently, health care professionals must maintain licenses in each state in which they render services. While most states have expanded licensing rules and reciprocity, their actions have been varied, inconsistent, and time-limited, which has created licensing barriers to a comprehensive COVID-19 response.
	•	This week, Senator Murphy and Senator Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire introduced legislation to support students with disabilities. The Supporting Children with Disabilities During COVID-19 Act would provide an additional $11 billion to support students with disabilities. The legislation would help ensure that all students—no matter their disability—receive the support and resources they deserve. 
	•	Senator Murphy also introduced bipartisan legislation with Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa to assist families who are struggling to afford diapers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 Diaper Assistance Act would provide $200 million in additional funds through the Social Services Block Grant program for diaper assistance.
	•	This week, Senator Murphy recognized Branford’s Wren Laboratories as this month’s “Innovator of the Month.” Based on a request from the Connecticut Department of Public Health, Wren recently introduced a saliva-based COVID-19 PCR detection testing system. In November 2020, Wren received Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its first-of-its-kind collection kit designed to be used for home, school, or workplace testing without medical personnel. The test includes a special buffer that stabilizes the viral signature ensuring accuracy as well as neutralizing the virus in the saliva, which reduces any possible harmful exposure in transit.
	•	Senator Murphy introduced Connecticut Education Commissioner Miguel Cardona at his hearing in front of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to be the next Secretary of Education. Murphy highlighted Cardona’s career of service as an educator and his family’s connection to the community in Meriden. Murphy and Cardona discussed some of Senator Murphy’s top education priorities, including making schools safer by reducing suspensions and expulsions as well as promoting racially and socioeconomically diverse schools.
	•	Governor Ned Lamont announced the launch of new services at the Connecticut Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) that will enable residents to renew their driver’s licenses and non-driver ID cards online without having to visit an office in-person. The DMV’s new online renewal option has already been offered to residents whose driver’s license or non-driver ID expired within the last 45 days. As part of the soft-launch of the new service during the last two months, more than 20,000 individuals have already successfully renewed online.
	•	Last week, President Joe Biden announced plans to re-open enrollment for the federal Health Insurance Marketplace, and took additional steps to strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, and protect women’s health.

Update on Barstow Veterans Home
￼
￼
￼
￼
This week CalVet released their report on the Barstow Veterans Home in response to a hard-fought initiative I led alongside local leaders and the Barstow community to save the facility.

Our veterans sacrificed everything to fight for our freedoms, which is why I have made it my mission to stop Sacramento's attempt to try to close the Barstow Veterans Home. This facility is home to 200 of our local veterans, and while we should celebrate its safety for another year, there is more work to be done to ensure we protect it in the future. Our veterans deserve the care and respect their service has earned, and I will continue to fight for them and ensure they have a place to call home here in our community.

It was wonderful to attend King of the Hammers last weekend! This event did a great job of taking COVID-19 precautions to ensure all involved were safe, including requiring a negative test result to attend. I had an informative tour of Hammertown with Dave Cole of Ultra4 Racing and enjoyed watching the start of several events. It was a great day to be in the High Desert!

Standing Strong for Hydropower
￼

The clean, renewable power generated by the dams along the Columbia and Snake Rivers supplies half of the Pacific Northwest's energy and is critical for a reliable power grid. I joined Reps. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, Jaime Herrera Beutler, and Russ Fulcher to introduce a resolution reaffirming our support of hydropower in the Pacific Northwest. 

The hydropower developed in our region benefits every resident, family, and business, and it is an important component of the all-of-the-above energy strategy that will ensure the United States maintains energy independence and leadership on the global stage. Without it, our way of life as we know it would cease to exist. 

Our resolution expresses that it is the sense of Congress that hydropower is an essential source of energy in the United States. The resolution states that hydropower should not only be protected, but that the U.S. should increase its generation and capacity of this clean, renewable source of power. 

Read the full text of the resolution on my website. 

Disaster Assistance Is On the Way
￼

On Thursday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved the Major Disaster Declaration for Central Washington’s devastating 2020 wildfire season. 

FEMA approved Public Assistance for Douglas, Franklin, Kittitas, Lincoln, Okanogan, Pend Oreille, and Skamania Counties as well as the Colville Tribes and Yakama Nation. The approval will unlock desperately needed relief to help our communities rebuild and repair damaged facilities after yet another record-setting fire season. I continue to urge the Administration to approve the application for Individual Assistance to help our families and businesses recover. 

Read more about the Declaration in the Yakima Herald-Republic. 
or on my website. 

Helping Disaster Survivors Stay Connected
￼

On Monday, I joined Rep. Mike Thompson (D-CA) to reintroduce the Preserving Home and Office Numbers in Emergencies Act, or the PHONE Act. This bill will ensure that families, homeowners, businesses, and farmers remain connected to the people and resources they need to get back on their feet after a natural disaster. 

The people of Central Washington and across the West understand the challenges of rebuilding after a natural disaster, like a catastrophic wildfire, and I am proud to introduce this legislation on their behalf.

Levine's Mismanagement is Wrong for Both Washingtons
￼

WATCH: Newhouse Rejects Levine Appointment to National Employment Post

President Biden recently appointed Suzi Levine, the former head of the Washington State Employment Security Department, to a senior position within the U.S. Department of Labor at the Employment and Training Administration. This new position puts her in charge of over $9 billion of taxpayer funds. 

Under Suzi Levine’s leadership, the Washington State Employment Security Department was defrauded of more than $600 million of taxpayer dollars, and thousands of Washingtonians went weeks without unemployment assistance during state-imposed shutdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I led a letter to President Biden, signed by my colleagues Reps. Jaime Herrera Beutler and Cathy McMorris Rodgers, expressing our concerns with her appointment and urging him to reconsider. You can read the full letter here. 

Supporting Rural Mothers
￼

This week, I reintroduced the Rural MOMS Act, a bill to improve healthcare access and outcomes for new and expecting mothers in our district and rural areas across the country. The alarming maternal mortality rates among rural and minority women is persistent and tragic, but in the 21st century, it can and must be fixed. 

The Rural MOMS Act takes concrete steps to address the root causes of this problem by advancing and rewarding innovative data reporting, expanding access to maternal telehealth services, provide training to better equip healthcare professionals to serve these women. 

Rural moms deserve the same standard of care as their urban counterparts, and this bill will make that a reality.

Putting Americans Before Terrorists

WATCH: Newhouse Rebukes Biden Plan to Vaccinate Terrorists Before America’s Seniors and First Responders

On Tuesday, I joined my colleagues in cosponsoring a resolution that opposes a plan by the U.S. Department of Defense to deliver vaccines to prisoners at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility until all Americans have had the opportunity to be vaccinated. Congress will not tolerate such disrespect of the American people. 

President Biden had previously proposed to vaccinate detainees at Guantanamo Bay, as millions of Americans await access to the vaccine. It is unconscionable that President Biden would suggest that terrorists should receive the COVID-19 vaccine before frontline healthcare workers, seniors, teachers, and other American citizens.

It is an honor and a privilege to represent you in Congress.

West Virginia Families Need Immediate Relief 
Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.) and I introduced bipartisan legislation calling for direct payments to American families to provide much-needed relief in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. 

The Coronavirus Assistance for American Families Act would provide a direct payment of $1,400 to adults and an additional $1,400 to any dependents, including tWest Virginia Families Need Immediate Relief e elderly or those with disabilities. Nearly 8 in 10 Americans support issuing $1,400 direct payments, which is also included in the President’s American Rescue Plan. 

Today’s weak job’s report highlights how American families are struggling and need immediate relief. More than half of households have reported major financial challenges due to the economic and public health crisis. By providing a third round of individual relief, millions of American families would receive the help they need. As Congress continues to negotiate additional COVID-19 relief measures, we must prioritize family-focused direct assistance to those who need it most.
 Background
The Coronavirus Assistance for American Families Act:
	•	Provides $1400 direct payments to each adult and each dependent equally. A couple filing jointly would receive $2,800; a family of four would receive $5,600.
	•	Full payment would go to single filers making $75,000 and joint filers making $150,000; above those levels, the payment decreases by $5 for every $100. This is the same criteria found in the CARES Act.
	•	Includes eligibility for adult dependents, such as those with disabilities and college students.
	•	Offers family-centric payments:
	•	These payments would provide single parents, especially those with multiple children, more assistance than under the CARES Act.
	•	Families that care for elderly or disabled relatives are also eligible for assistance.

Democrats Push Budget Vote
On Wednesday, I voted against the House Democrats “budget” plan that will give the Democrat Majority a blank check to pass their agenda.
Despite President Biden’s rhetoric about unity and bipartisanship, it’s clear that Democrats are intent on ramming through their far-left checklist. Instead of building off the bipartisan COVID relief packages passed and signed into law last year, and working across the aisle to provide targeted relief, Democrats have made it their mission to push a $2 trillion wish list with policies unrelated to the pandemic.
Wednesday's vote is the first step that sets up a process to push through expensive, radical, partisan policies under the guise of COVID relief.
Background:
	•	Reconciliation is a fast-track, budgetary tool used to implement policy changes into law. Legislation considered under reconciliation only requires 51 votes in the Senate for passage.
	•	Triggered by Congress adopting a concurrent budget resolution that includes reconciliation instructions.
	•	Instructs authorizing committees to report legislation that meets specified targets. While reconciliation is often used for deficit reduction, it can also be used to increase spending or reduce revenues.
	•	Although reconciliation is a powerful tool, it does have limits:
	◦	Can only be used to make changes to mandatory spending, revenue levels, and/or the debt limit.
	◦	A maximum of only three reconciliation bills are allowed for each fiscal year’s budget resolution: one for mandatory spending, one for revenue, and one for the debt limit.
	◦	Limited by the Senate’s Byrd Rule which prohibits “extraneous” provisions.

West Virginia Vaccine Rollout Receives National Spotlight
On Tuesday, the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee Oversight and Investigation held a hearing on how states can increase COVID-19 vaccinations where I praised the success of West Virginia COVID-19 rollout and Operation Wrap Speed.
No one is giving proper credit to Operation Wrap Speed. Last year Dr. Fauci testified before the Senate HELP Committee and stated, ‘it could a year to 18 months before a vaccine would be developed.’ But through the hard work of pharmaceutical companies, researchers, and scientists two maybe three vaccines are available in less than a year since Operation Wrap Speed was created. This is truly remarkable.
Operation Warp Speed created the vaccine, it’s the job of the states to put it in people’s arms and some states can’t even get that right. Getting as many Americans vaccinated against COVID-19 as quickly as possible needs to be our top priority. Widespread vaccination is vital to getting back to normal in our daily lives and restoring our economy. Learn from states that are doing this well, don’t make excuses and blame the Trump Administration.  Dr. Clay Marsh, West Virginia's Coronavirus Czar and WVU Health Sciences vice president and executive dean testified on why West Virginia has been so successful in the vaccine rollout. 
""I thank Cong. McKinley for the invitation to join other state healthcare leaders from around the country to discuss West Virginia's successful COVID-19 vaccine rollout. It was an honor to be able to share how West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice assembled a team of state and local partners with the shared purpose of saving lives, promoting the wellbeing of our citizens, and supporting the capacity and function of vital healthcare and community assets,” said Dr. Clay Marsh, West Virginia’s Coronavirus Czar and WVU Health Sciences vice president and executive dean.

Fighting to Reduce the Cost of Medicine
Yesterday, Peter Welch (D-Vt.) and I introduced bipartisan legislation that would address a loophole contributing to the rising cost of health care for consumers and threatening access to lifesaving medications.
The 340B program was created to help hospitals who serve our rural communities with the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs. Unfortunately, the pharmaceutical industry has abused loopholes and hurt rural hospitals and patients by charging exorbitant prices. Our bill would put a stop to this by making sure that the orphan drug exclusion is used as intended, so that patients continue to get the treatment they need.
The 340B Drug Pricing Program requires drug manufacturers to provide outpatient drugs to eligible health care organizations at significantly reduced prices. This includes Federally Qualified Health Centers, Critical Access Hospitals, Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program grantees, and certain types of hospitals and specialized clinics with a high proportion of Medicare and Medicaid patients. Current law excludes so called “orphan drugs,” which are designated by the Department of Health and Human Services and treat rare diseases, from this program. Drug companies take advantage of this loophole to charge higher prices for these drugs even when they are not used for the rare condition or disease that they received orphan status for.
The Closing Loopholes for Orphan Drugs Act would restore the original intent of Congress and close this loophole by limiting the ‘orphan drug’ exclusion to only apply in instances where the drug is used for the rare condition or disease for which it was designated. This will ensure the ‘orphan drug’ designation isn’t exploited to prevent offering the 340B discount for non-orphan uses of the same drug.

West Virginia Strong - The Comeback Plan
Over one hundred and twenty thousand COVID-19 cases have been confirmed in West Virginia as of today. The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources established a toll-free hotline for questions from the public and medical providers concerning the pandemic. The department also has a website with the most up-to-date information regarding the confirmed and pending cases. 

In May, Governor Jim Justice announced his plan for reopening the economy. Reopening will not happen suddenly, but with time. We should be able to open in a safe and cautious manner as long as we continue to follow the social distancing guidelines. 

The STAY-AT-HOME order was lifted on Sunday, May 3rd and a SAFER-AT-HOME was put in place on Monday, May 4th.

Dear Friend,

This was a busy week in Washington, DC. I spent the week working for our district by attending my first committee hearing and speaking on the floor in support of reopening our schools. This week also marked my first full month in office. I shared some highlights and reflections on my first month as your representative, which you can view here. As an immigrant, I never imagined I’d be serving this great country in Congress. I am grateful for the opportunity you’ve given me every day.  

I’ll be using this newsletter as a way to keep you up to date on my work on behalf of our Orange County community, so make sure you sign up for regular updates. You can also connect with my official Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages, where I’ll be posting the latest news and updates. 

Serving California's 48th District

News: More Vaccines for Southern California
This week, CVS Pharmacies announced that starting February 11th they would begin COVID-19 vaccinations for eligible groups at 100 of its stores across California. Stores in Los Angeles, Newport Beach, Huntington Beach, and Irvine are among those in Southern California included in their vaccine rollout. Read more. 

Fighting Against CA Unemployment Fraud
Last week, news outlets reported that California taxpayers lost over $11 billion due to widespread unemployment fraud. Despite multiple warnings of fraud, California continued “to pay claims despite having evidence that they are very likely fraudulent.” 

This irresponsible mismanagement of taxpayer dollars is unacceptable. That’s why I led my California colleagues in a letter requesting answers on California’s plan to remedy this issue to ensure any further federal funds are not mismanaged, and Californians who are legally entitled to legitimate COVID-related UI benefits will be able to receive them without delay. Read the full letter here, and an excerpt below: 

“Without any accountability mechanisms in place or plan to recover fraudulent COVID-related UI payments, we fear that there will be a continued decline in taxpayers’ faith in California’s ability to administer other critical pandemic relief programs, such as vaccine distribution. Federal and California taxpayers deserve answers to our questions, assurances that their tax dollars will not continue to be wasted, and to be reimbursed for the $11.4 billion the State of California has lost.” 

Your Voice in DC 


Safely Reopening our Schools 
This week I spoke on the House Floor in support of the Reopen Schools Act. In December, Congress sent states $54 billion dollars for K-12 education. This bill would ensure this money is used to get students back in the classroom safely and soon. Our students’ physical and mental well-being continues to be challenged - it's time to open the schools. Click here to watch my remarks. 
￼


First T&I Committee Hearing 
This week I had my first Transportation and Infrastructure Committee hearing and highlighted my ongoing commitment to safe, reliable and modern transportation for California families. I asked about the federal diesel tax and its impact on the trucking industry in our local communities. A video of my introductory remarks and questions can be viewed here. 
￼


Thanking our Law Enforcement 
During and after the violent attack on our Capitol, our law enforcement have been working around the clock to keep members and staff safe. To show my appreciation, this week I delivered breakfast to our Capitol Police officers and the National Guardsmen and women still stationed at the Capitol. God bless our law enforcement.

Greetings,
In his first two weeks in office, President Biden stacked up 29 Executive Orders. Most notably, he has cancelled the Keystone XL Pipeline permit and halted any new oil and gas leases on federal lands. 
Without a significant decrease in demand for oil and natural gas – which we know won’t happen overnight – the U.S. will resume importing energy from overseas sources where we cannot control environmental regulation and where dependency on foreign oil endangers our national security.
Our fragile economic recovery and already high unemployment rates cannot handle the strain of these Executive Orders. Arkansas alone will lose over $3.5 million in revenue from oil and gas leasing on federal lands that would have otherwise been used to protect and conserve our state through the Land and Water Conservation Fund. 
A study by American Petroleum Institute found that the U.S. will lose a million jobs by 2022 and $700 billion in GDP by 2030. President Biden has no plan to replace these lost jobs with those in clean energy any time soon.
Instead, the free market should be allowed to use American innovation and ingenuity to continue improving clean energy sources and create clean energy jobs gradually. Rules and regulation will not help the environment or a suffering American workforce. It will only fulfill promises to the radical left who are out of touch with real American families.
Until next week,
￼
Bruce Westerman

2/5/21 18:21,Protecting Oregon’s rivers for generations to come,"￼ 
Dear Lindsey,
Rivers and streams are Oregon's lifeblood. They provide clean drinking water for our families, sustain our thriving outdoor recreation economy, hold cultural and ecological significance for indigenous peoples, and nurture the quality of life that brings new investments, businesses and jobs to our state. 
When I asked Oregonians to submit candidates for new rivers and streams for protective management, and received more than 15,000 nominations from 2,500 individuals, the message was loud and clear: Oregonians cherish our state's rivers and want them managed in a manner that protects them for generations to come.  

That's why this week I introduced the River Democracy Act to add nearly 4,700 miles of rivers and streams in Oregon to the national Wild and Scenic Rivers system - the largest Wild and Scenic Rivers effort in our nation's history. More protected rivers and clear management objectives means more jobs, improved wildfire resiliency and a guarantee for the livability of Oregonians. 

￼ 
My River Democracy Act represents the best of the Oregon Way, and I look forward to continuing the conversation with our neighbors. 
Sincerely, ￼
￼ ￼ ￼

2/5/21 18:23,A Plan to Fight the Pandemic,"￼ 
  

Dear Neighbors,
It’s been another busy week as Congress works to end this pandemic and deliver help to American families. I went to the White House this week with House Democratic leaders to meet with President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. We discussed passing the President’s American Rescue Plan to provide relief to the American people and additional resources to crush the coronavirus pandemic. President Biden stressed the need for swift Congressional action.
As Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, I am prepared to move forward with legislation that will speed up the distribution of vaccines, expand national testing efforts, ramp up health services in underserved communities, and fund other critical needs. There is simply no time to waste – we must provide the Biden Administration all the tools and resources it needs to finally contain the spread of this virus.
I also spoke on the House Floor in favor of President Biden’s American Rescue Plan. This legislation cleared procedural hurdles in Congress this week, and I’m confident we are on the right path to deliver help to hardworking Americans soon. The American Rescue Plan is a comprehensive, multipronged, national approach. It is robust because we need a big plan to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic. 
This bill will deliver another round of direct payments to eligible families and invest billions to speed up the distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines across the country. It will support the development of community vaccination centers, as well as mobile vaccination units that can go into hard-to-reach areas that are often underserved. Read more here
I held three hearings this week on the COVID-19 pandemic. During the first hearing, I heard experts discuss how we can accelerate vaccine distribution to states while ensuring equitable access for those most vulnerable to COVID-19. Thankfully, the Biden Administration has purchased additional doses that will increase our vaccine supply with the goal of reaching a total of 300 million Americans by the end of summer. Read more here  
In our second hearing, I heard from experts about how we can improve our response to the pandemic through a more robust and reliable medical supply chain and increased testing and contact tracing. Read more here
Finally, I held a hearing on fraud and scams during the pandemic. Fraud and scams pose real threats to consumers’ health, safety, and financial well-being. Unscrupulous sellers are taking advantage of fear and uncertainty during this difficult time to peddle counterfeit and substandard personal protective equipment, sham testing kits, and bogus cures online. These products can endanger one’s health and their online stores may just be a front to scam consumers. We must do more to end the threat these bad actors pose. Read more here

2/5/21 18:24,"Weekly Wrap-Up: community pharmacies, COVID-19 vaccine","￼

Dear Lindsey,  This week, I voted to get comprehensive COVID-19 relief quickly and efficiently to those who need it in the Seventh District and across the country. I also sent a letter calling on the administration to incorporate lessons learned from states that have implemented successful, community-led vaccination strategies in its national vaccine distribution strategy — a few days later, President Biden announced that his administration would begin shipping vaccine doses directly to local pharmacies.
 
Please keep reading for a recap of the past week and additional information. As always, thank you for the honor to serve our district.
  
 
WHAT WE KNOW: VACCINE DISTRIBUTION IN VIRGINIA
 
  
I know that the COVID-19 vaccine rollout has been incredibly frustrating for so, so many people throughout the Seventh District. My team and I are working to get accurate information that we can share with you as it becomes available.
 
Governor Northam directed the Virginia Department of Health to expedite its work on a centralized statewide vaccine registration system to create more efficient processes for scheduling, confirming, and successfully receiving a vaccination appointment. This system is currently being developed and is expected to be complete soon. Rest assured that we will update you as soon as we have clarifying information.
  
 
WHAT I'M WORKING ON
 
  
Last week, I sent a letter to the Department of Health and Human Services calling on this administration to bring community pharmacists into our national vaccination strategy. On Tuesday, President Biden announced that select community pharmacies will receive supply to vaccinate priority groups at no cost. As we continue to navigate the vaccine distribution plan in the Commonwealth, our local health officials and volunteers are working to expand Virginia's vaccination efforts. READ MORE from the Richmond Times-Dispatch
 
Today, the House passed the National Apprenticeship Act, major legislation focused on expanding workforce development programs, including my initiative to strengthen apprenticeship programs to prepare the next generation to secure high-skilled jobs and stay competitive in a global economy. Apprenticeship programs will be an important component of our long-term economic recovery, and this legislation strengthens the relationships between Virginia's high schools, community colleges, and local employers to help our students secure employment.

Last year, we received over 1,900 cards and letters!

BROADBAND 
Take a Speed Test Here. 
The sad fact is that many places in West Virginia simply do not have access to reliable broadband and the lack of access affects West Virginians every day. Back in 2015, the FCC released a coverage map that stated 99.9% of Americans had wireless coverage. I knew then what I know now: That is just plain wrong. 
HOW MAY WE HELP YOU? 
To request assistance from my case team, click here.  As your U.S. Senator, I am proud to be your voice with government agencies during your time of need. My goal is for me and my staff to provide the best possible customer service for every West Virginian who contacts me needing assistance. While I have no direct jurisdiction in legal or administrative matters of any federal, state, or local agency, I welcome the opportunity to assist you in any way possible and to assure that full consideration is given to your case.

SENATE OVERWHELMINGLY PASSES BIPARTISAN MANCHIN, COLLINS AMENDMENT TO TARGET CHECKS TO THOSE WHO NEED ASSISTANCE  Washington, DC – Today, by an overwhelming vote of 99-1, the Senate passed an amendment to the budget resolution introduced by U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Susan Collins (R-ME) to target stimulus checks to families who need assistance as opposed to upper-income taxpayers. Senators Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ), Rob Portman (R-OH), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Jon Tester (D-MT), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Mark Warner (D-VA), Mike Rounds (R-SD), Angus King (I-ME), Mitt Romney (R-UT) and Mark Kelly (D-AZ) cosponsored the amendment.  ""American families in every corner of our country are struggling right now. Instead of sending stimulus checks to families who earn $300,000 a year we should be targeting this relief to families and individuals who need it most. For those who are struggling to pay rent or to put food on the table this $1,400 will make a significant impact on their ability to get by. These families need our support right now,"" said Senator Manchin. 
MANCHIN APPLAUDS NEW CONTRACT FOR FAIRMONT NOAA FACILITY   Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) applauded the new National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) contract with L3Harris to install equipment at the NOAA Consolidated Backup Facility (CBU) in Fairmont for an upcoming Space Weather Follow On-Lagrange 1 (SWFO-L1) Command and Control project.   “I am pleased that Fairmont’s NOAA facility is partnering with L3Harris to install new equipment in advance of the launch of the Space Weather Follow On-Lagrange 1 (SWFO-L1) Command and Control project. The Fairmont CBU facility will play a vital role in the launch of NOAA’s new project and I applaud the men and women at the facility for continuing their important work to help predict our climate and weather. NOAA’s continued investment in our workforce is great news for the Fairmont community and the entire state and I will continue to work with our local, state and federal partners to bring more investments to the state."" 
MANCHIN, CAPITO ANNOUNCE $3.5 MILLION FOR RALEIGH COUNTY AIRPORT INDUSTRIAL PARK  Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced the Raleigh County Memorial Airport Industrial Park will receive $3.5 million award from the U.S Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration (EDA) and the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC). The $8.3 million project will also receive $4.8 million in funding from state, local and private sources. The Raleigh County Memorial Airport Industrial Park project will grade 105 acres of land, construct an access road, and install water and sewer infrastructure to create land that is primed for commercial and industrial development.  ""In 2019, I invited ARC Co-Chair Tim Thomas to visit West Virginia to see for himself the impact ARC awards have on our economic growth and job creation across the state. During Tim’s trip, we had the opportunity to visit with project stakeholders and over a year after our visit, I’m pleased to announce the Raleigh County Memorial Airport Industrial Park project will receive $3.5 million from the ARC and EDA to develop more sorely needed investment ready sites for the region. This project will give Southern West Virginia an opportunity to diversify the economy and workforce by attracting new investments in the aerospace and aviation sectors. These investments will create new good-paying jobs for our fellow West Virginians and I look forward to the growth it will bring to our state,"" said Senator Manchin. 
MANCHIN, CAPITO ANNOUNCE $5.9 MILLION FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES IN WEST VIRGINIA  Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $5,921,559 in Mental Health & Substance Abuse Service Grants to two locations in West Virginia. Of the $5,921,559 provided, $2,000,000 will be granted to West Virginia Department of Health and Human Services to help battle the rise in opioid abuse during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the remaining $3,921,559 will be provided to Prestera Center for Mental Health Services in Huntington for service expansion. This funding is made available by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  ""The COVID-19 pandemic has put an enormous strain on many West Virginians struggling with mental health issues and has made it even harder for many people with substance use disorder to receive treatment,"" said Senator Manchin. “This funding is vital to the fight against the drug epidemic and will help save lives by supporting substance use disorder treatment programs and helping those with mental health issues. This battle is far from over and I will continue to fight for funding to help combat the drug epidemic in West Virginia and provide support for our fellow West Virginians during this difficult time."" 
SENATE PASSES MANCHIN AMENDMENT TO PROTECT RURAL HOSPITALS  The Amendment Was Based On Senator Manchin’s Save Our Rural Health Providers Act That Would Create A 20 Percent Rural Set-Aside In The Provider Relief Fund Washington, DC – This evening, by a 99-1 vote, the Senate passed an amendment to the budget introduced by U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) to help prevent hospitals from closing their doors and protect patients’ access to care, particularly in rural and underserved regions. The amendment strengthens and supports the Provider Relief Fund, which has been a lifeline during the pandemic for hospitals, nursing homes, health centers and physician practices across the country, but especially in rural America. The amendment was co-sponsored by Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Rob Portman (R-OH), Angus King (I-ME), and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK).  ""Last year, 18 rural hospitals closed across America and 3 of those closures were in West Virginia, which drastically impacted healthcare access across the state. The CARES Act passed last March established the Provider Relief Fund to support hospitals, health centers, clinics and providers who provide care to our most vulnerable Americans every day,"" said Senator Manchin. ""So far, Congress has appropriated $178 billion to this fund, yet only 6 percent of the funding has been directed to rural providers. I introduced the Save Our Rural Health Providers Act to create a 20 percent set aside in the Provider Relief Fund for these rural healthcare providers. Nearly 20 percent of Americans live in rural communities, making a 20 percent set aside only fair. We’re not asking for a handout, we’re just asking for our fair share and I am pleased my colleagues on both sides of the aisle supported my commonsense amendment."" 
MANCHIN QUESTIONS DEPUTY SECRETARY OF DEFENSE NOMINEE HICKS DURING NOMINATION HEARING  Washington, DC – Yesterday, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), member of the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC), questioned Deputy Secretary of Defense nominee Dr. Kathleen Hicks during her nomination hearing on business reform and ensuring accountability within the Department of Defense (DoD).  ""The “spend it or lose it” culture that’s in government across the board, how can we change it? How can we spend more money than all the other challengers we have all around the world and not get efficiency from it…I think there is a lot of waste and redundancy that we can really work on…We must also hold the prime contractors that do business with us accountable for the securities of their networks down into their subcontractors…that’s where all the information is being stolen from that has to be secured and it has not been. I look forward to working with you, especially on the business reforms that need to be made,"" said Senator Manchin in part. 
MANCHIN BILL TO PROTECT MILITARY RETIREES FROM LOSING HEALTHCARE  Washington, DC – Yesterday, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) introduced the bipartisan TRICARE Retiree Protection Act to ensure that America’s military retirees will not lose their healthcare as a result of new policy changes that took effect on January 1st, 2021. Senator Steve Daines (R-MT) cosponsored the legislation.  ""Our servicemembers bravely fought for our nation and as they retire after years of selfless service, it is our duty to ensure they’re taken care of. I introduced the TRICARE Retiree Protection Act to extend the grace period from 180 days to 12 months to enroll in a payment plan for retired servicemembers and their families. This extension helps ensure no retired servicemember is left without healthcare coverage, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a member of both the Senate Armed Services Committee and Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, I will continue to fight to ensure our servicemembers and Veterans have access to quality, affordable healthcare to retire in peace,"" said Senator Manchin.

WORKING FOR YOU
MANCHIN, MURKOWSKI, HASSAN, SHAHEEN, TESTER, CRAMER, KING CALL ON BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO DISTRIBUTE FUNDING TO HELP RURAL COMMUNITIES DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC  Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Jon Tester (D-MT), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), and Angus King (I-ME) called on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to prioritize and quickly distribute the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund to rural and underserved communities hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, funded in the recent year-end spending package, is intended to support testing, contact tracing, surveillance, containment and mitigation to monitor and suppress COVID-19.  The Senators said in part, “In recognition of the unique challenges faced by high-risk, rural, and underserved areas, and the fact that current population-based formula funding may not factor in these circumstances, Congress set aside $2.5 billion provided in the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund for “high-risk and underserved populations and rural communities” to be allocated in a targeted manner. While this package did not provide the set-aside for rural providers that we have argued for in our bipartisan COVID-19 relief proposal, it provided an essential lifeline to help them navigate these next few months, and it was coupled with other critical assistance for these providers that we urge you to implement as quickly as possible… With the very concerning trends in rural America, additional resources are needed to ensure that health providers and health departments have the funding necessary to address the COVID-19 pandemic. This Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund set-aside should be distributed to support rural and underserved communities across the United States as quickly as possible."" 
MANCHIN: WEST VIRGINIA TO RECEIVE INCREASE IN WEEKLY MODERNA VACCINE ALLOCATION  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) received notification that West Virginia will be receiving an increase in the weekly Moderna vaccine allocation.  ""This afternoon I was notified West Virginia will see a 1,500 dose increase in our weekly Moderna vaccine allocation. West Virginia continues to lead the nation in effective and safe COVID-19 vaccination distribution and I am pleased that these efforts are being rewarded with an increase in these vital doses. As vaccine production increases, I will continue to work with the Biden Administration to quickly procure more doses so every West Virginian who wants a vaccine can get one,"" said Senator Manchin.  This is the second consecutive increase for West Virginia with the state receiving a 3,700 dose increase this week and an additional 1,500 dose increase next week.  On January 21st, Senator Manchin spoke with General Gus Perna, Chief Operating Officer of Operation Warp Speed on COVID-19 vaccine procurement and distribution about the need for additional vaccines in West Virginia. He received assurances that the Biden Administration is ramping up manufacturing and expects to see an increase in distribution to every state in early February.   On January 24th, Senator Manchin spoke with members of the National Economic Council and stressed that the number one priority must be quickly producing and efficiently distributing the vaccine throughout the country.  On January 26th, Senator Manchin applauded the Biden Administration announcement that they would increase the weekly vaccination supply and increase transparency by giving three week forecast of vaccine supplies.  
MANCHIN, CAPITO ANNOUNCE $630K FOR WEST VIRGINIA HEALTH CENTERS  Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), members of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced $630,480 from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to help health centers provide care for minority West Virginians diagnosed with hypertension, or high blood pressure.  ""Our front line healthcare workers have gone above and beyond the call of duty to take care of our fellow West Virginians throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. As we continue to learn more about COVID-19, studies have found that minority populations are disproportionately affected by COVID-19 and that there is a direct association between high blood pressure and more severe cases of COVID-19. In West Virginia over 1 in 3 adults have hypertension, making it essential for our healthcare providers to have the necessary resources to help control high blood pressure and improve COVID-19 outcomes in our state. I am pleased HHS is investing in our health centers to ensure they can provide quality, accessible healthcare to our minority communities and as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, I will continue to advocate for funding and resources to support health centers across West Virginia,"" said Senator Manchin.

ENERGY COMMITTEE NEWS
MANCHIN TO SERVE AS CHAIRMAN OF SENATE ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE   Senator Manchin Will Set Agenda As The Lead Democrat On The Senate Committee On Energy And Natural Resources  Washington, DC – Yesterday, the United States Senate passed the organizing resolution giving Senate Democrats control of committees and officially appointing Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Senator Manchin served as Ranking Member of the committee in the 116th Congress and has been a member of the committee since being elected to the Senate in 2010.  ""I am incredibly proud of everything we accomplished for the people of West Virginia and the entire country during my tenure as Ranking Member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in the 116th Congress. Working in a bipartisan way, we secured the enactment of laws to update our national energy policy for the first time in 13 years through the passage of the Energy Act of 2020. We also permanently reauthorized and provided full, mandatory funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund and made monumental investments in our National Park system and other public lands by passing the John D. Dingell, Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act and the Great American Outdoors Act –the most sweeping conservation legislation in a generation. We also passed historic legislation for West Virginia by designating the New River Gorge as a National Park and Preserve, which will promote the beauty and historical significance of the New River Gorge,” Senator Manchin said. “I am proud of the Committee’s productive, bipartisan work last Congress, but our work is never done and with a new administration incoming there is no shortage of work to do to advance a cleaner energy future while ensuring no worker is left behind and our energy independence remains uncompromised As we begin this new Congress, I would like to welcome our new Committee members, Senator John Hickenlooper of Colorado and Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, who will bring valuable perspective and experience to the Committee. I look forward to working with Ranking Member John Barrasso (R-WY) and every committee member to build upon the accomplishments of the 116th Congress, quickly consider and confirm the nominees that come before our committee, and get to work on the energy and natural resources issues facing West Virginians and Americans everywhere.""  ENERGY COMMITTEE SENDS SECRETARY OF ENERGY NOMINEE TO SENATE FLOOR WITH BIPARTISAN VOTE   Manchin votes to confirm Granholm to be Secretary of Energy  Washington, DC – Today, the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a business meeting to consider the pending nomination of Governor Jennifer Granholm to be the Secretary of Energy. She passed out of committee by a recorded vote of 13-4. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), incoming Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, voted to support Governor Granholm’s nomination. Governor Granholm previously committed to Senator Manchin that DOE will prioritize investments in states that have lost traditional energy jobs.  ""As I said at Governor Granholm’s hearing last week, I believe she is extremely well qualified to lead the Department of Energy and I strongly support her nomination. She has the leadership skills, the vision, and the compassion for people that we need at the helm of the Department of Energy to face the climate challenge, and at the same time, preserve our energy security, protect our national security, cleanup the Cold War legacy, and preserve our scientific and technological prowess. I am pleased to support her nomination, and I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting to report her nomination,” Senator Manchin said.  MANCHIN, COMMITTEE HOLD FIRST CLIMATE HEARING OF 117TH CONGRESS   Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), incoming Chairman of the Committee, convened the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee for a hearing to examine global climate trends from energy related sectors to consider where and how progress has been made in addressing climate change. Senator Manchin stressed the need to put the priorities of our nation before partisan politics and to work together to combat the global climate challenge.  ""Climate change is an issue critical not only to our states, and our nation, but to every country around the world. To address climate change, we must face it, head on, on a global scale and in every sector of our economy. No doubt we will all have differing views on the best way to do that. But first, I believe we must begin with a common understanding of where we stand today, and what got us here. [I]t is abundantly clear that dwelling on partisan rhetoric shuts down debate, collaboration, and progress. As we look for ways to heal the divisions in our own country, I believe that one way for us to overcome our differences of opinion is by first grounding ourselves in the facts, which will serve as a guide going forward,” Senator Manchin said.  Senator Manchin highlighted the declining costs of many energy technologies as a set of facts that make the case for innovation. Senator Manchin also set the economic scene by pointing to downturn in coal communities and other traditional energy producing regions as well as continuing fossil fuel use in other countries as fundamental to the work of the Committee.  ""As our energy mix has changed, concern about the impacts on these traditional energy communities has and will remain front of mind for many of our members and I will continue to work hard to ensure that those communities are given new opportunities to thrive, including as a member of the new IEA global commission focused on examining the impacts of a clean energy transition on individuals and communities. Although fossil fuel consumption is dropping on the U.S. power grid, the global trends in fossil fuel use should make us all recognize that fossil fuels aren’t going anywhere anytime soon, particularly in countries that are seeking to expand access to electricity and energy in order to address poverty.” Senator Manchin said. “By pursuing an all-of-the-above energy policy and a broad array of emissions reducing technologies, we can simultaneously build our technology export opportunities and diplomatic relationships with those countries who choose to utilize their own fossil resources.""  MANCHIN JOINS GLOBAL COMMISSION TO PUT PEOPLE AT THE HEART OF THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION   Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, issued the following statement after accepting an invitation to join Our Inclusive Energy Future: The Global Commission on People-Centered Clean Energy— a newly formed high-level global commission convened by the International Energy Agency (IEA) and made up of key figures from across the globe to examine the social and economic impacts of the shift to cleaner energy technologies on individuals and communities.  ""I am proud to be part of a global effort that acknowledges and will examine the increased hardships on traditional energy producing communities amid the shift to a cleaner energy technologies. As our global energy mix changes, concern about the impacts on these communities that have historically mined the coal, produced the fuels, and generated baseload power has and will loom large for families not only in my state of West Virginia, but across the nation and in every country around the world. I believe it is the responsibility of those who serve in government to also keep it front of mind and ensure that reinvestment is targeted to address that concern. As a member of this new IEA global commission, I will continue to work hard to ensure that these hardworking communities are given new opportunities to thrive. I am honored to join this effort and to ensure we leave no worker behind as we move towards a cleaner energy future.”

Apprenticeships for the Marianas

The House passed H.R. 447, the National Apprenticeship Act of 2021, which will provide the Marianas with $2.8 million over five years to create and expand registered apprenticeship programs. I co-led this bipartisan bill which fully incorporates the text of the Outlying Area Apprenticeships Expansion Act that I introduced last Congress. Apprenticeships are well recognized as a way to help local economies grow by providing career opportunities to young people. But the current national apprenticeship system has not adequately supported the creation of apprenticeships in the Marianas. With my language included, H.R. 447 will address that inequity. Our school systems already equip students with the skills that employers seek. Now we need to build the connection between what was learned in the classroom and the real-world workplace. Apprenticeships provide that link. And with widespread unemployment due to the coronavirus, that link is needed now more than ever. 
 

Funding for job training

The Marianas would receive $300,000 to help job seekers in the Marianas find gainful employment under my bill, H.R. 836 - the Employment Services and Jobs Parity Act. H.R. 836 amends the Wagner-Peyser Act to include the Marianas. This change would make additional federal assistance for career guidance, skill assessments, and referrals to job training available to Marianas job seekers. Education and Labor Chairman Robert C. “Bobby” Scott has committed to working with me to “make the Marianas an eligible entity for Wagner-Peyser Assistance,'' when Congress takes up the reauthorization of  the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. The reauthorization is expected in this Congress. 
 

$11.2m for Garapan revitalization

The Biden administration released $11,177,918 to improve infrastructure in the core Garapan tourist area on Thursday. Congress appropriated these disaster recovery funds in 2019 and the Commonwealth quickly submitted an application for Garapan revitalization, but the previous administration did not act. So, the congressional office met with the Biden transition team after the election and asked that the Commonwealth’s disaster grant applications be prioritized. Altogether, the Commonwealth submitted 7 applications worth $95 million from the disaster funds Congress appropriated in Public Law 116-20. Up to now only one application had been approved: $10.7 million for a workforce development and training facility at Northern Marianas College. Although, EDA did provide a court-ordered $1.7 million for a Commonwealth Utility Corporation water filter project. The $11.2 million will be used to upgrade streets in the Garapan area, where so many tourists spend time. Streets will be widened to approximately 24 feet with a minimum of 6 feet of sidewalks for tourists’ safety and comfort. New lighting, landscaping, and street markings and signages will be installed. In all, 10,685 linear feet of roads will be repaved. The grant is expected to help create nearly 300 jobs and generate more than $1.3 million in private investment.
 
 

Biden reverses Trump on FEMA waiver

Just two weeks after the Trump administration said no to Governor Ralph Torres’ request for a waiver of the local match required for COVID-related grants from FEMA, President Biden has announced the federal government will cover 100 percent of the cost. Our new President understands the Commonwealth and state governments throughout our nation, are cash-strapped because of the pandemic. We cannot afford a local-share of FEMA assistance. At the same time, we cannot let that cash shortage slow down our response to COVID or prevent people in need from getting help. President Biden sees the big picture and made the right call. His directive means all work eligible under FEMA’s existing COVID-19 policies, including increasing medical capacity, non-congregate sheltering, and emergency feeding distribution, going back to January 2020, will be reimbursed 100 percent by the federal government. President Biden is also expanding the activities eligible for 100 percent reimbursement. This includes personal protective equipment and disinfecting services and supplies. It also includes safely opening and operating eligible schools, child-care facilities, healthcare facilities, domestic violence shelters, transit systems, and other costs incurred after Biden became President.
 

Insular area equity now

With a Democrat in the White House and Democratic majorities in Congress, now is the time to resolve long-standing inequities in the treatment of Americans residing in the Marianas and the U.S. territories. That is the case that House Natural Resources Committee Chair Raúl Grijalva and I made in an article published this week. Americans living in the insular areas are barred from participating in presidential elections, for instance, despite the enormous difference it makes to our livelihoods and futures who occupies the White House. Chair Grijalva and I argue that Congress and the Biden administration should agree to provide full voting rights for insular area Americans. That means not only a vote for President but full voting representation in Congress, too. We should also prioritize the expansion and extension of key federal programs to the insular areas by including us all in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program and by removing the cap on Medicaid funding. Now is the time for change. 
 

$220k compact funds for education

The Northern Marianas has been allocated $220,384 in FY21 Compact Impact discretionary funds, Interior’s Office of Insular Affairs announced Monday. Congress appropriated $4 million in discretionary compact impact funds for FY21 and required the funds be used exclusively for education services. The money is distributed among the Marianas, Guam, Hawaii, and American Samoa based on the number of migrants in each from the freely associated states of Palau, the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia. The Commonwealth must now submit a proposal for using the compact impact funding for educational purposes by March 1, 2021. In addition to the discretionary $4 million, Congress also provides $30 million annually in mandatory funding to help defray health, education, infrastructure, and other costs associated with hosting FAS migrants. In 2018, the Census Bureau estimated the number of FAS migrants in the Northern Marianas at 2,431— 6 percent among the affected jurisdictions.

Making Progress on Additional COVID-19 Relief and Fighting for NH Veterans
With nearly 1,100 lives lost to COVID-19 in New Hampshire and individuals and small businesses facing unprecedented financial challenges, Congress must provide people with additional relief.   This week, we took an important step forward when we passed the outline of an another relief package. Now as we get to work finalizing the details, I am focused on bolstering public health and vaccine distribution efforts, delivering economic relief for individuals and small businesses, providing aid to our schools as they work to reopen safely, and providing resources for state and local governments as they work to combat the pandemic and avert further layoffs.   Communities in New Hampshire and across the country need this additional support – and we must get this done.   In addition, this week, I was thrilled to join the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs.   As the daughter of a World War II veteran, it is my great honor to join this Committee and have the opportunity to build on my bipartisan efforts to get veterans the care and support that they need and have earned. Throughout my career in public service, I have focused on expanding opportunity and strengthening care for veterans, while working to build a country that is ever-worthy of their service.  I am eager to partner with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle as a member of the Committee to make a real difference in the lives of veterans in New Hampshire and across the country. 
With every good wish,  ￼   Senator Maggie Hassan 
What the Senator is Working On
Senator Hassan is leading a bipartisan, bicameral effort to strengthen the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Solid Start program, which aims to contact every veteran multiple times by phone in the first year after they leave active duty to check in and help connect them to VA programs and benefits. Learn more here.  Senator Hassan joined colleagues in reintroducing the Paycheck Fairness Act, legislation that would help eliminate the gender wage gap and guarantee that women can challenge pay discrimination and hold employers accountable. Read more here.  Senators Hassan and Shaheen called on Congressional leadership to provide specific relief to the restaurant and hospitality industries in the upcoming COVID-19 package. Read more here. 
Photo of the Week
On Wednesday, Senator Hassan paid her respects to Officer Brian Sicknick at the Capitol Rotunda. After the ceremony at the Capitol, Officer Sicknick was laid to rest at Arlington National Cemetery. Officer Sicknick died after being injured during the insurrection at the Capitol.

Fighting for our CA-39 Small Businesses
￼

This week, I joined my first Small Business Committee hearing on helping our small businesses during COVID-19. I will fight for pro-growth policies to help our CA-39 businesses safely reopen and gain access to the hundreds of billions of dollars in PPP funding waiting to be spent.

I'm excited to serve as Ranking Member of the Small Business Subcommittee on Innovation, Entrepreneurship and Workforce Development & to also serve on the Subcommittee on Economic Growth, Tax and Capital Access.

As a Korean American who ran a small business, I want to make sure future generations have access to the resources they need to achieve their American dream. I look forward to doing exactly that & promoting pro-growth policies to support our economy and future workforce.

Giving Back to My Community

￼

As an immigrant, mother of 4 and small business owner, the fact that I am able to give back to my CA-39 community and our country is a testament that the promise of America is alive and real. 

I will do all I can to make sure future generations can achieve their American dream.

Working in a Bipartisan Way
￼

I gave my first floor speech this week! Nearly $1 trillion in COVID-19 relief funding passed last year has yet to be spent. We must ensure our communities with the most need get relief right away. 

The only way we will get through this pandemic and get things done is by working together.

Holding Gov. Newsom Accountable for CA Taxpayers

$11 billion of CA’s unemployment claims were fraud and another $19 billion worth are under investigation. This is a gross misuse of taxpayer dollars and hurts those with legitimate claims during COVID-19. 

I joined my CA GOP colleagues in urging Governor Newsom for answers. Learn more, here. 

COVID-19

I am committed to helping California's 39th District get through the COVID-19 pandemic better than before. As we work to safely reopen communities and get people back to work, I will do all that I can to make sure my constituents receive the relief you deserve.

Vaccines are currently available for CA-39 residents ages 65+.

2/5/21 19:35,One step closer to COVID-19 relief for Central Floridians,"
￼

Dear friends and neighbors,

Central Floridians have waited far too long for additional COVID-19 relief and they cannot afford any more delays. That's why this week, I joined my colleagues in passing the 2021 Budget Resolution, ensuring that we can deliver on President Joe Biden's American Rescue plan and provide urgently needed relief for struggling families. Providing resources to communities who are severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic has been the main priority of the House Democratic majority since the beginning of this crisis — and we must act quickly for families who can't wait another day for help. 

Next week, we will be writing the legislation to create a path to the final passage of the Biden American Rescue Plan so that you and your family get the relief you deserve before the end of February.  

While we work in Congress to bring relief to all Americans, we are also working on the ground in Florida's 9th District to provide constituents with up-to-date information on COVID-19 vaccine distribution efforts. 
￼

As of last week, Floridians who are eligible can pre-register for a vaccine appointment. After registration, individuals will be notified when appointments become available in their area. The vaccine is safe and effective, and I encourage everyone eligible to get vaccinated. Our community is counting on you!

Ensuring Equitable Distribution of the COVID-19 Vaccine
￼

As a member of the Energy & Commerce Committee, I have had the opportunity to advocate for rural communities in our district to be included in vaccination efforts. During a subcommittee hearing this week, I highlighted the disparities faced in Polk and Osceola Counties, as well as our enthusiasm for working with the Biden Administration to expand access. 
￼

Writing a Letter to House and Senate Leaders for America's Youth 
￼

Members of the Future Forum Caucus, a group of young Members of Congress who focus on issues important to younger Americans, wrote a letter to House and Senate leaders urging them to include provisions that address the student loan crisis and economic impact payment qualifications in the next COVID-19 relief package. It is crucial for our youth to be considered in any economic recovery plan!

Recalling the Events of January 6th

On Thursday, Members of Congress were given the opportunity to come together and share our accounts of the events that took place during the January 6th insurrection. I did so in the form of a poem titled ""A Bird's Eye View of Insurrection.""

Working with the Biden Administration to Boost Vaccine Allotments in Florida 
￼
￼
￼
￼
Florida's vaccine allotment rose by 16% this week! We look forward to working with the Biden Administration in the coming months to secure more vaccines for our state. 

Currently, we are in phase 1, which means the vaccine is available for long term care facility residents and staff, persons 65 years of age and older, and healthcare personnel with direct patient contact. 

In March, Florida will begin distributing the vaccine to critical organizations (as identified by the governor) and vulnerable populations who are at risk of severe illness. 

During phase 3 in April, our hope is that the vaccine will be available to the general public. 

As we continue receiving updates, we will communicate with our constituents to make sure everyone has the opportunity to be vaccinated against COVID-19. 

I have been vaccinated and urge you to do so once you are eligible! 
￼

Securing Federal Resources for COVID-19 Vaccine Costs 
￼

We are thrilled that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) awarded Florida $245 million to cover 100% of our vaccination program costs. Costs can include equipment for vaccine storage, personal protective equipment, emergency medical care, and more. 

COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution in the District

As COVID-19 infections rise in Central Florida, we are working with local officials to provide up-to-date information on vaccinations. For more information on your county's distribution plans, please visit the websites linked below.

Demand for the COVID-19 vaccine is far in excess of the supply the state has received so far. It is anticipated that additional supplies will be coming soon. Florida has many sites that are providing COVID-19 vaccines to eligible persons. The state is prioritizing persons 65 years of age and older, health care personnel with direct patient contact, and residents and staff of long-term care facilities. Please be aware that some locations are only serving very specific populations, such as frontline health care workers. Appointments may be required and vaccine availability will vary from day to day and week to week, as we work to provide vaccines to the most vulnerable first.

2/5/21 19:48,A Big Step Forward Toward More Relief,"￼  
Dear Friend,   I am deeply grateful to the public health workers and researchers who are working tirelessly around the clock to develop, manufacture, and distribute coronavirus vaccines to millions of Americans. Their work represents some of the important steps forward in our fight against this virus, and they are inspiring hope in one of America’s most difficult winters.   Now it’s up to the government to make sure those health workers have the resources necessary to ramp up the distribution of the vaccines, and that our communities get what they need to stay safe while they wait for their doses. That’s why President Biden released his American Rescue Plan -- and why I joined my Senate colleagues in voting early this morning to expedite the process for congressional committees to draft and turn it into law.   I’ve heard throughout my conversations with educators, business owners, frontline health workers and other essential workers, and families from all across Oregon about the difference more stimulus checks, personal protective equipment, and loans would make in weathering this storm. The American Rescue Plan would deliver on those needs, as well as help with desperately needed child care, keep people on the brink from being evicted, and help state, local, and tribal governments avoid laying off firefighters, teachers, and others we depend on. And of course, it will -- a year late -- finally fund a true national strategy to support testing and vaccinations.   The American people were sick and tired of the ‘delay and water down’ relief strategy that was on full display last year -- and they’re trusting President Biden and the new Congress to deliver bold emergency relief. I’m gratified that today’s vote will take us one step closer to delivering on that promise.   All my best,  Jeff

February 5, 2021
 
Dear Friend, 
 
This week began with a deployment ceremony for the Charlie Company 3/172nd Infantry Regiment of the New Hampshire National Guard (NHNG) on Monday as they prepared for a yearlong deployment to the Middle East in support of Operation Spartan Shield. From supporting our communities during the COVID-19 pandemic to protecting our nation’s capital during the peaceful transition of power to serving abroad and so much more — the bravery and patriotism of the men and women of our National Guard have made the Granite State Proud. We owe them — and their families — a debt of gratitude for their service as we pray for their safety.
 
 
￼
  
 Attending the New Hampshire National Guard deployment ceremony on Monday
 
It was a somber moment on Wednesday morning when I honored the life, service, and sacrifice of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died from injuries sustained while defending the U.S. Capitol — and our very democracy — from a mob of pro-Trump insurrectionists on January 6th. To lie in honor in the Rotunda of the Capitol is a fitting tribute to the courage and sacrifice of Officer Sicknick. My heart is with his family, friends, and colleagues.

This week, the Energy and Commerce Committee held its first hearings of the 117th Congress in both the Oversight and Investigations and Health Subcommittees. I’m proud to serve on this influential committee to advance legislation to crush COVID-19 and help us move forward. I recently introduced two different bills to ramp up vaccine production and ensure that we can get vaccines into arms as quickly and efficiently as possible. This Congress, I will be rejoining the House Agriculture Committee where I look forward to bringing the voices of Granite State farmers and producers to Washington as I work to advance the priorities of New Hampshire’s agriculture economy.

An update from outside the Capitol
 
 
Working to End the COVID-19 Pandemic and Get Vaccines into Arms
 
 
The Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee held a hearing on Tuesday to examine the distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines in the United States. While it’s taken remarkable, unprecedented efforts to get safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines developed, authorized and distributed around the country, it won’t be enough to curb the spread of the virus if we cannot get vaccines into arms quickly.
 
 
 
￼
 
 Questioning witnesses during the Oversight & Investigations Subcommittee hearing
 
 
In the Energy and Commerce Health Subcommittee on Wednesday, we held a hearing appropriately titled, “Road to Recovery: Ramping Up COVID-19 Vaccines, Testing, and Medical Supply Chain.” At this hearing, we heard from public health professionals and supply chain experts that one of the keys to getting the COVID-19 crisis under control is ensuring we use these vaccines to their full capacity and improve our health data systems. I’m glad that Congress has put resources toward modernizing our public health data infrastructure, but it is clear that we need to do more. Through my role on the Energy and Commerce Committee, I will continue working to ensure that our supply and infrastructure meet the demands of this public health crisis. 
 
 
 
￼
 
 
Questioning witnesses during the Health Subcommittee hearing
 Yesterday, I joined a call with Congressman Chris Pappas and the New Hampshire Hospital Association’s members and leadership to discuss New Hampshire’s COVID-19 response, the current capacity of hospitals, the ongoing distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, and federal support for New Hampshire’s health care system. I look forward to my continued work across the aisle with my colleagues in the House and Senate, as well as the Biden-Harris administration to advocate for adequate and robust support for our hospitals, rural health systems, and providers.
 
 
￼
  
 
Speaking to the New Hampshire Hospital Association members and leadership
 Today, I spoke on the House floor to call for my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to prioritize getting the COVID-19 vaccines equitably and efficiently distributed and administered. The development of two highly-effective vaccines in under one year is an unprecedented scientific accomplishment, but this effort is only truly recognized when we can get vaccines widely distributed. There is no greater public health priority than getting this vaccine into the arm of every American who wants it, and I’m committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure the equitable distribution of the vaccine.

The Biden Administration Continues to Deliver Good News
 
 
As we reach the end of the second full week of the Biden-Harris Administration, I am feeling more hopeful about the future of our nation. This week, the Biden administration struck a deal with Australian manufacturer Ellume to secure what will be the country’s first over-the-counter, at-home COVID-19 test. Just like vaccines and precautions such as wearing masks and practicing physical distancing, access to COVID-19 testing is key to keeping people safe and combating the spread of the virus. At-home tests will make it easier for people to find out if they are infected so they can take steps to stop the spread and keep their communities safe. 

I applaud the Biden-Harris administration for creating a family reunification task force. The practice of separating families at the border was one of the most despicable exploits of the Trump administration that I personally witnessed at a facility in McAllen, Texas. The heartless, shameful family separation policies caused lasting trauma and pain for thousands of children and families.

I’m also thrilled the administration is creating a new Gender Policy Council – a reformulation of the Obama administration’s White House Council on Women and Girls. Some of the goals of this council include restoring and expanding reproductive rights, combating gender-based violence, reducing maternal mortality, and adding the Equal Rights Amendment to the Constitution.

This week, several of President Biden’s cabinet nominees were confirmed and sworn in, including our new Transportation Secretary, Pete Buttigieg. COVID-19 has highlighted the urgent need for us to advance and improve our infrastructure in the Granite State and across the country. I look forward to working with Secretary Buttigieg and the talented, experienced, diverse team that the President is building to ensure we rise to the challenges facing our communities and build back better.
 
 
 
Working to Expand Access to Mental Health Resources, Treatment for Substance Use Disorder
 
 
As the founder and co-chair of the Bipartisan Opioid Task Force, I am proud of my work with both Republicans and Democrats to address substance misuse and expand access to treatment and resources. I introduced the Emergency Support for Substance Use Disorders Act with Congressman John Katko (R-NY) on Tuesday. The ‘new normal’ during the COVID-19 pandemic has added additional stress for those struggling with substance use disorder and this health crisis has made it more difficult for many to get the treatment that they need. Our legislation will help ensure that funding can reach providers so that Granite Staters at risk of substance misuse have access to the care and support they need.
 As we contend with the dual crises of COVID-19 and untreated mental health and substance use disorders, funding for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) is urgently needed. I helped to lead a bipartisan letter urging congressional leadership to include robust funding for SAMHSA in the next COVID-19 relief bill. 
 
 
 
Celebrating Black History Month
 
 This Black History Month, I’m celebrating the inauguration of our nation’s first female, Black vice president, Kamala Harris! She may be the first, but she will not be the last. I’m also celebrating incredible young Black voices, like Amanda Gorman, who captivated worldwide attention when she read her poem, “The Hill We Climb” at President Biden and Vice President Harris’s inauguration ceremony last month. Amanda is an inspirational young leader, and I look forward to seeing what she does next. You can read her interview with former First Lady Michelle Obama here. 
 
 
 
News You Can Use
 
 
It breaks my heart every time another friend or colleague reveals that they are a survivor of sexual assault, but sadly, it’s not surprising. By bravely opening up about her history of trauma and sharing her experience during the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is helping to destigmatize these important conversations. I commend her for her courage. As a sexual assault survivor and victim of the January 6th terror attack, I was profoundly moved when Rep. Ocasio-Cortez said that “trauma compounds on each other.” If you or someone you know are experiencing sexual assault, abuse, or domestic violence, you are not alone and help is available. The NH Coalition Against Domestic & Sexual Violence (NHCADSV) has resources available. The NH Domestic Violence Hotline is at 866-644-3574 and the NH Sexual Assault Hotline is at 800-277-5570 – both are confidential and available 24/7.
 This week, I helped to announce over $12.6 million in federal CARES Act funding from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) for St. Joseph Hospital in Nashua. Since the pandemic began, St. Joseph Hospital has been providing lifesaving care to Granite Staters in one of the hardest-hit regions of the state. This CARES Act funding will help the health care professionals at St. Joseph continue to provide care and services to people in need in the southern tier.

Sign-ups for Phase 1B of New Hampshire’s COVID-19 vaccination process are now open. Phase 1B opens vaccine registration to:
	•	Those 65 years or older
	•	Those under 65 but medically vulnerable
	•	Residents or staff of residential facilities
	•	Correctional officers working in facilities 
Confirm your eligibility and register for your vaccination on www.vaccines.nh.gov/. If you need assistance, you can call 2-1-1 for help. 
 
As always, the CDC and the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services are the best resources to turn to during the COVID-19 public health emergency. If you are sick, stay home and call your health care provider. If you live in NH and have questions about coronavirus, dial 211 or visit CDC.gov for more information.

Dear friend,
If you closely followed all the news coming out of Washington, D.C. this week, you know the topics that made headlines. The news cycle keeps running, but I want to reassure you that my focus remains on responding to the crises at hand: controlling this virus and providing relief to struggling Americans in the midst of this pandemic.
Fewer COVID-19 cases are being reported in San Diego, vaccines continue to be administered and some businesses are reopening. These are all positive signs, but we are far from resuming our normal lives. Please be safe and help keep those around you safe as well.
I continue my work in the district to stay in touch with the people I represent. Below is another update on some of the work my staff and I have done this week to serve you.

Legislative work
Addressing key gaps in our national COVID-19 response through legislation
This week, I re-introduced the bipartisan Health STATISTICS Act to improve our nation’s real-time response to COVID-19. 
Currently, reporting COVID-19 cases and vaccine statistics, such as patient demographics or cause-of-death information, is not compulsory. This granular data is key to track and fight the virus, but is missing from our COVID-19 response. We must break down the data siloes that make it difficult for researchers to combine different data sources. This will allow researchers to accurately analyze the effects of the virus nationwide. Expanding data accessibility and infrastructure will ensure we understand the full scope of the pandemic and address it accordingly. 
This bill answers escalating calls from experts, lawmakers and public health professionals to fix detrimental information gaps and barriers exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
I also introduced the Tracking COVID-19 Variants Act with Rep. Ami Bera (CA-07) and Sen. Tammy Baldwin (WI) this week. This legislation provides crucial funding to scale up national genomic sequencing efforts. Sequence-based surveillance is vital to track virus mutations and further protect public health. In combination with other efforts like my Health STATISTICS Act, this bill would ensure our country is ready to combat the next phase of COVID-19 guided by science and accurate information.
Vote to pass budget resolution and start reconciliation process
￼
On Wednesday, I helped the House pass a Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2021 to begin budget reconciliation – a legislative tool to ensure the swift passage of President Biden's $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package. In my experience, it's better to start the clock and set a deadline for Congress.
When we passed the emergency COVID bill late last year, we knew more resources were needed to fight the virus and provide additional relief for many Americans who have been devastated financially. Bipartisanship has intrinsic value, and we should prioritize it, but this process will guarantee support for those bearing the brunt of this crisis, no matter the politics.
Watch my floor speech on the budget resolution and reconciliation, HERE.

Virtual town hall on COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and distribution
￼
On Wednesday evening, I held a virtual town hall with two San Diego health experts to discuss COVID-19 vaccine efficacy and distribution. Dr. Shane Crotty, professor at La Jolla Institute for Immunology and Dr. Corinne McDaniels-Davidson, director of the Institute for Public Health at San Diego State University answered questions from attendees and provided timely information about the vaccine and the effects of this virus on our bodies and our communities. Thank you to our special guests as well as our attendees for your engagement and participation. Let's keep learning together and let science guide the way forward.
Watch the recording of the virtual town tall, HERE.

Meeting with students from Congregation Beth Am
￼
On Monday, I met with a group of students from Congregation Beth Am to discuss various topics including the US-Israel relationship, regional threats and rising antisemitism. We also spoke about the need for cooperation in scientific research to develop drought-resistant farming and combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

NEW: Participate in our weekly poll!
Last week, we introduced a new section in our e-newsletter for readers to weigh in on a relevant topic. Thank you to everyone who participated. Here's this week's question:
There are currently two COVID-19 relief plans being considered to help the American people: Republican senators proposed a plan worth $618 billion, while President Biden's plan calls for $1.9 trillion in federal spending. What do you think is the best course of action for Congress to help families and businesses given the severity of this crisis?
Click here to submit your answer via Google Forms. We'll share the results in next week's e-newsletter. We appreciate your engagement and feedback.
Last week's question was ""Do you approve of President Biden's wide-ranging executive orders during his first days in office?"" Here are the results:
490 Responses: 68% Yes, 20.2% No, 3.3% Somewhat, 2.4% Not entirely, 6.1% Other

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or need assistance with a federal agency, reach out to us through our website or by calling the district office at 858-455-5550.

Dear Friend, 
 
I hope you are staying safe and healthy during the pandemic. Remember to check out Nebraska’s Department of Health and Human Services’ webpage for information on the COVID Vaccine rollout in Nebraska.
 
We are two months into the 117th Congress and the majority party, despite claiming an interest in “Unity,” has been focused on generating partisanship votes. For example, the vote to remove Rep. Marjorie T. Greene from her committee assignments because of comments made before she was elected. I have strongly condemned her comments and theories she made but voted NOT to remove her from her committee assignments because it sets a bad precedent. The people in her district knew of her remarks and still voted her into office. In my statement, I said:
 
“For the first time in 234 years, one party is dictating committee assignments to the other party. This action by the democrats will have long-lasting consequences and they are setting themselves up for receiving the same treatment in two years. I strongly condemned the horrible and inexcusable remarks Rep. Greene made prior to being elected, which she has since apologized for. Minority Leader McCarthy even offered a compromise to remove her from the Education Committee. What happens down the road when Republicans regain the majority? Will the democrats agree to remove from Committees the Representatives that told people to get in the faces of those they disagree with at public places; or who made serious anti-Semitic remarks; or who accused another member of attempted murder? The Democrat leadership is sowing the wind and will reap the whirlwind.”
 
Let me be clear-- I don't condone this action and don't want to see it used in two years against democrats. But it could happen.
 
I want you to know that I have previously condemned Qanon and the conspiracy theories and even voted yes on H.Res. 1154 in the last session which was a resolution stating that condemnation. Unfortunately, there are bad actors out there trying to say I support Qanon simply because I voted AGAINST the impeachment of President Trump. I believe that it was unconstitutional to charge him with it, as the consequence of being found guilty is removal from office and Pres. Trump was going to be leaving office one week after the vote. I explained this in my news release, which you can read here.
 
We can and must do better as a nation to come together. We have to move forward or else we will become more fractured. As we begin the 117th Congress, my office plans to introduce legislation that helps all Nebraskans and ensures we are on the right track to provide relief that actually benefits Americans and doesn’t just get us by.
This week, I also voted against the S.Con.Res.5 which would establish the congressional budget for Fiscal Year 2021 and direct 12 House Authorizing Committees and 11 Senate Authorizing Committees to submit bills that allow an increase in the deficit of up to $1.9 trillion. This would help make President Biden’s $2 trillion COVID relief package a reality.
 
I will keep working hard on these and other issues affecting you. If you have a question, please feel free to reach out to me here.
 
Sincerely,
￼

Dear Friend, 
The need to expand access to quality and affordable health care could not be more urgent. As a result of COVID-19, we’ve seen millions of Americans lose their employer-provided health insurance, which has only served to exacerbate this public health emergency. Fortunately, we have an opportunity this Congress make sure that no family ever forgoes medical care just because they can’t afford it. 
This week I was proud to introduce the Health Care Improvement Act – legislation to lower health insurance costs for working families and protect coverage for Americans living with preexisting conditions. This bill would help counter the devastating effects of this health and economic crisis, which is why I’m gong to be working with my colleagues to get this passed and onto the President’s desk.   
Frankly, after four years of relentless Republican attacks to the Affordable Care Act, I’m glad to see that health care is an early priority for the Biden-Harris Administration. I’m particularly encouraged by the Administration’s plan to open a special enrollment period – something I called for more than eight months ago. This move will allow folks who lost their coverage during the pandemic to sign up for health insurance on healthcare.gov starting February 15. 
I’m also pleased that President Biden’s executive order calls on agencies to review policies that undermine protections for those with preexisting conditions. Throughout my time in the Senate, I’ve pushed to protect the more than 3.5 million Virginians living with a preexisting condition. In fact, last Congress I led my colleagues in urging the Trump administration to limit “junk plans.” I also forced a vote on the Senate floor to try to stop the propagation of these bare-bones plans that destabilize the health insurance market and discriminate against people with preexisting conditions.
As always, you can count on me to keep working to lower health care and prescription drug costs for working families. In the meantime, I encourage you continue to care for your neighbors by washing your hands, wearing a mask, and practicing social distancing while we get this crisis under control. 
If you want to share your thoughts about an issue that’s important to you, you can send me an email any time using the form on my Senate website. You can also follow me on Facebook and Twitter. I look forward to hearing from you. 
Sincerely, 
￼

Accelerating our National COVID Vaccine Plan
 
 
February 6, 2021
 
Dear Friends,
Since the beginning of America’s national vaccine rollout, state and local health departments have faced serious headwinds distributing and administering the COVID vaccine. After the Trump Administration chose to focus COVID efforts almost exclusively on vaccine development with only small amounts of contradictory guidance on preventing spread through mask wearing and social distancing, the lack of clear vaccine guidance and support has had a catastrophic impact. 
Whether due to a lack of transparency in vaccine allocation to states each week, inconsistent guidance on who to prioritize, surprise revelations about the absence of vaccine reserves, or simply a lack of vaccines available, the only constants throughout this process have been confusion and frustration.
Fixing America’s COVID vaccine distribution needs to be treated as the emergency it is.  
This week, I spoke at our first Energy and Commerce subcommittee hearing of the new term on the status of America’s vaccine distribution and lessons we have learned so far. We heard from state public health experts who shared their experiences with the vaccine rollout thus far, problems they face and steps we can take to expand and accelerate vaccinations. 
These experts made clear that we need to move swiftly to speed up vaccine production and significantly expand and accelerate distribution in ways that are more efficient and equitable.
President Biden has taken quick action to strengthen our nation-wide vaccination effort. He has committed to reaching 100 million doses administered in his first 100 days in office. To achieve this goal, the Biden-Harris team has:
	•	Pushed for $20 billion for a national COVID-19 vaccine program, as part of the broader $1.9 trillion COVID rescue package Democrats are advancing swiftly through Congress, to speed distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines, including funding specifically for getting vaccines to underserved communities;
	◦	The plan also includes setting up community vaccination sites nationwide, scaling up testing and tracing, providing paid sick leave to contain spread and making needed investments so schools can reopen safely.
	•	Crafted a national COVID-19 strategy starting with ten executive orders that include creating a public dashboard with real-time national and state-level COVID-19 vaccination and spread data as well as other COVID-19 response priorities;
	•	Invoked the Defense Production Act in an effort to increase the supply of materials necessary for COVID-19 vaccination, an action I had been pushing the Trump Administration to take from the beginning weeks of this pandemic;
	•	Committed to provide state vaccine allocation estimates at least three weeks ahead of shipment; and 
	•	Increased vaccine allocations to states 16 percent, totaling 10 million doses each week.
We don’t have time to waste. I continue to support Biden-Harris Administration efforts to push these emergency response proposals. I strongly urge my Republican colleagues in both the House and Senate to do the same. Look honestly and candidly at this crisis and its ongoing impact on our lives, our families, our businesses, our communities and our great nation. See the pain felt each day by so many Americans in our own hometowns and beyond. Join us in taking swift, bold action to face down this pandemic and rescue our struggling communities. 
Each day brings us closer to the end of this crisis. Swift, bold leadership and a nation united in a common purpose can bring that day even closer. Let’s get it done. 
  
And, as always, thank you for reading.

Throughout this pandemic, my office and I have worked to make sure you remain informed with the latest updates and recommendations on any and all COVID-19 related topics. With that in mind here is some information from the FHA that may be of interest to you:
	•	The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) announced that it will extend the deadline for borrowers with FHA-insured mortgages who are struggling financially due to COVID-19 to request and receive mortgage payment forbearance from their mortgage servicer. 
	•	The new deadline is March 31, 2021, allowing borrowers additional time to request and obtain up to six months of an initial pause in their mortgage payments.
	◦	Borrowers needing assistance must engage with their servicer to obtain an initial COVID-19 forbearance on or before March 31, 2021.
	•	The extension aligns with FHA’s recent extension of its foreclosure and eviction moratoria for single family homeowners with FHA-insured mortgages, also extended through March 31, 2021. 
	•	Borrowers with FHA-insured mortgages seeking additional information on available options should visit FHA’s COVID-19 Resources for Homeowners web page on FHA.gov. Other borrowers are encouraged to visit the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Coronavirus Mortgage and Housing Assistance web pages.

February 06, 2021
Dear Friend,
 
The last month has been challenging – but I’ve never been more confident in our future and our democracy than I am now.
 
As Congress reconvened ready to serve in the New Year, we faced an important duty: to certify the votes of the Electoral College. The certification has been conducted following every presidential election in U.S. history and this year it was the final step to certify Joe Biden and Kamala Harris the President and Vice President-Elect of the United States. Our work was disrupted by violent insurrectionists attacking the Capitol, incited by irresponsible rhetoric.
 
While my colleagues, staff, and I remained safe, my heart remains broken by the insurrection that erupted and the desecration of our Capitol, a building that is the living embodiment of our liberty and democracy, a temple that represents the sanctity of the rule of law, the voice of the people, and the fundamental values we hold dear. I’ve recorded a short video sharing my thoughts on the attack and what it means for our country – I hope you take a moment to watch it.
 
Following the deadly attack on the Capitol, Congress reconvened and was able to certify the 2020 election. On January 20 America inaugurated its 46th President, Joe Biden, and Vice President Kamala Harris, the first woman and person of color to be elected to that office. In just a few days, we have seen President Biden take action to acknowledge and address the spread of coronavirus, speed up vaccine distribution, stop family separation at the border, get America back at the table on climate change, take steps to dismantle systemic racism, and bring humility and grace to the White House. I am heartened by the team President Biden is forming to help lead our country. It is clear that President Biden is ready and able to bring our country together and lead us forward.
 
Our union remains strong. Our democracy may bend, but it will never break. As we begin a new chapter, let us find it within ourselves to unite, heal, and, move forward as one United States.
 
Sincerely,
 
Marcy Kaptur
 
Member of Congress

This week, I had the honor to introduce a fellow Iowan, Tom Vilsack, former two-term Governor of Iowa and former Secretary of Agriculture for eight years in the Obama administration during his confirmation hearing to be the current Secretary of Agriculture. 
As a Governor, Secretary Vilsack grew opportunities for green energy including biofuels. This is very important for the 43,000 energy jobs in Iowa. If confirmed, I will look to him to be a voice of reason within the Biden Administration on the future of biofuels. 
I joined some of my Midwest colleagues to introduce legislation that would require the EPA to update its greenhouse gas modeling so we can see all the benefits achieved through alternative energy.

WEEK IN REVIEW 
Dear Friend –    Hearing from Iowans in every corner of our state—from the smallest towns to the biggest cities—is one of my top priorities. This week, I continued to do exactly that by hosting my first telephone town hall of the year with farmers and other members of our state’s agriculture community, and I’m grateful to Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig for joining the discussion. 
￼ 
Click here to read more about my tele-town hall from KYOU. 
While I continue working to defend the livelihoods of all Iowans, I wanted to share a few highlights from what else I’ve been working on this week:  

Let’s Safely Get Our Kids Back Into School 
This week, I was proud to help introduce the Put Students First Act of 2021, legislation which would prohibit federal funding to schools that do not provide an in-person learning option by April 30, 2021.
￼ 
The science and the data show that we can and should safely and responsibly reopen our schools. It’s time we put our kids first, get political incentives and the narrow interests of public sector unions out of the way, and do the right thing by safely returning students to the classroom.  

Holding Bad Actors Accountable  
Following a report that bureaucrats at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) participated in a “widespread and well-known” scheme misspending millions of taxpayer dollars over a decade, I introduced legislation to hold these bad actors accountable. 
￼  
The misspent funds were intended for the development and procurement of vaccines, drugs, therapies, and other medical countermeasures needed to respond to public health emergencies—like a pandemic. This is criminal, and it’s why Congress should take action to create more transparency and accountability and ultimately to help prevent future abuse of Iowans’ tax dollars. 

Advocating for Iowa Agriculture  
Building on my efforts to defend and promote Iowa’s biofuel industry, I joined my colleagues in urging the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to take action to restore integrity in the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS).    I was also proud to help introduce a bill that directs the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to establish a grant program to support the deployment of renewable fuel infrastructure.     As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee , I questioned USDA Secretary nominee Tom Vilsack on the future of the RFS and President Biden’s executive action to transition to electric vehicles.    I also questioned President Biden’s nominee to lead the EPA, Michael Regan, on his commitment to defending the RFS and his view on the new Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule.  

Fighting for Justice  
This week, nearly every Senate Democrat rejected my effort to require federal law enforcement to prioritize detaining and prosecuting illegal immigrants charged with violent crimes, similar to my bill, Sarah’s Law.  
￼ 
Click here or on the image above to watch my remarks. 
By rejecting this commonsense measure, my Democratic colleagues sided with violent illegal immigrants – like Sarah’s killer – and turned their backs on justice.  

Protecting Iowa Jobs and Small Businesses 
￼ 
I received unanimous support from my Senate colleagues for my amendment to prevent a $15 federal minimum wage hike during a global pandemic, a move that could kill jobs for lower-wage workers and severely burden Iowa small businesses and rural economies that are facing unprecedented challenges amidst COVID-19. 

BONUS READ 
If we want there to be jobs left for workers to go to, both during and after this pandemic, a huge spike in the federal minimum wage is simply unsustainable. Instead, we should provide targeted relief to families and businesses and facilitate an economic recovery across our state and country.

Unemployment Fraud and Your 2020 Taxes
My office has received numerous calls from individuals who received a 1099 in the mail from the Arkansas Department of Workforce Service (ADWS) for an unemployment claim that was fraudulently filed in their name. Please see below the information from the ADWS regarding the steps you need to take to by February 12th to correct this matter.
Per ADWS website: If you receive a 1099 in the mail for fraudulent unemployment claims and you have already submitted a police report, a corrected 1099 form will be sent to you (reflecting zero unemployment compensation) once the police report has been fully processed by ADWS. Unfortunately, due to sheer volume, we are still processing the police reports that have already been submitted. 
If you have not provided a copy of your police report, please submit a copy to ADWS.InternalAudit@arkansas.gov as soon as possible. The only way we can remove fraudulent charges from your social security number is by receiving a police report from your local law enforcement agency. In order to remove fraud victims from the 1099 information to be submitted to the IRS, ADWS must receive a police report no later than February 12. Police reports received after that date will require revised 1099 information be submitted to the IRS which could impact the processing of your income tax return. If you have not received a 1099-G and you believe it was mailed to an incorrect address, please contact your local Arkansas Workforce Center office so that they may update the address on file for you. 
You will receive a 1099-G at the correct address when they are reissued. Additional guidance regarding a 1099-G received as a result of identity theft is available from the Internal Revenue Service here.

2/6/21 9:30,Rushing A Budget Reconciliation,"
￼

Congressman Smith's E-news: February 6, 2021  
￼

This week I had the privilege of attending the annual National Prayer Breakfast virtually.

Rushing A Budget Reconciliation

Budget reconciliation is a longstanding tool intended to provide an expedited track for making changes to federal law relating to long-term budgeting. The primary purpose of reconciliation is to allow budget-related policies to pass through the Senate with a simple majority, without the need to reach a 60-vote majority to end debate. It has been used regularly under majorities in both parties to change tax policy, enact spending cuts, and to implement policies like welfare reform. 

While this tool is intended to make budgeting easier, implementation of policy changes as dramatic as what comes from a reconciliation cannot, and should not, be rushed. But this is exactly what Congressional Democrats are doing. Rather than working across the aisle to establish a proper budget with long-term goals, Democrats are speeding toward using reconciliation in two ways never intended – to enact short term spending policy and to implement new non-budget federal mandates.

Democrats are using reconciliation to move forward with President Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. In the fight against COVID-19, there is no doubt Americans are in need of assistance. However, many of the measures within President Biden’s package, like the $15 per hour minimum wage, are both economically harmful and budgetarily non-germane. With the hospitality industry and small businesses everywhere struggling to stay afloat, it is preposterous to think now is the time to increase the hourly minimum wage to $15. This measure is not part of the federal budget and should not be included in budget reconciliation.

I also have serious concerns about the rush to move President Biden’s coronavirus relief package when there is still roughly $1 trillion of stimulus money that remains unspent. While we may need to move additional resources into major needs like vaccine distribution, we should have a more thorough analysis of available funds and how they can be used to meet our most pressing needs before we consider spending another nearly $2 trillion. This week I wrote to President Biden asking for a more thorough accounting of outstanding funds. According to the last available estimate from December, there is still $280 billion for the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, $29 billion for agriculture, $58 billion for state and local aid, $239 billion for health spending, and $59 billion in education funding that remains unused.

The Democrat push for budget reconciliation is nothing short of a push for their own wish list. We should be focused on real solutions which would utilize allocated funds for coronavirus relief, get teachers and students back in the classroom, and establish a more proportional vaccine distribution strategy. Now more than ever Americans need targeted relief, not a partisan budget gimmick.

2/6/21 9:34,Celebrating Black History Month,"￼ 

February 6, 2021 
Dear Fellow Marylander: 
Every February, we mark Black History Month by coming together to highlight the achievements and contributions of Black Americans to our national story, and the centuries of struggle that have shaped our society. 
At every turning point in American history, Black American advancements and calls to action have driven our nation’s cultural, economic and social progress forward, and helped hold to account the promises of freedom and equality for all that our founding doctrine failed to uphold. 
For too long, this history and the names and faces of those who marched, sacrificed and fought for change, have been obscured by prejudice and hate. It is our responsibility to remember those who marched for justice, the causes they sacrificed to defend, and the forces they marched against. 
When we ignore the systemic racism of our past, we cannot right those wrongs in the present. The consequences of such inattention are grave and live on in present day: the ongoing racial and religious profiling; brutality and killing of Black Americans by police; the high rates of COVID-19 transmission and death in Black communities; and disproportionate impact this current economic crisis has had on Black workers and Black-owned businesses.  
Last year, our nation’s fight against racism was given new urgency by the callous killing of George Floyd by a police officer in May. While the Trump administration fanned the flames of bigotry, hate and racism, leaders across the nation mobilized against them and against inequities in our criminal justice, economic, and healthcare systems. People marched, mobilized, and voted to advance justice and keep our communities safe. 
The historic election of President Joe Biden, and our nation’s first Black woman Vice President, Kamala Harris, serve as a reminder of the power of collective action. The new administration gives us opportunity to take meaningful action in government to create a more just society. 
In the year ahead, Congress must work together to advance the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to bring transparency and accountability to law enforcement, as well as the John Lewis Voting Rights Act to combat voter suppression and finally restore the Voting Rights Act of 1965. It is our charge to mobilize at all levels – from our communities to the Oval Office – to advance social, economic, and civil rights and justice to all Americans and to finally expel all vestiges of slavery and white supremacy that exist in our nation. 
Black History is American history, it is the story of Maryland and it is the story of our nation. Black History Month is a reminder to look toward this past and to act on our responsibilities in the present. 
Celebrating Black experiences and culture contributes to the greatness of our diverse society. It highlights one of the many strong components that make this nation a beacon around the world despite our inherent flaws. 
The realization of justice and true equity rests on our work to build a country committed to righting historic wrongs, closing gaps in achievement an opportunity, and dismantling vestiges of inequality in our foundations. I remain fully committed to justice, equality and opportunity and the American values that we embrace in our effort to form a more perfect Union. 
Thank you. Stay well.

2/6/21 10:01,Weekly Update: COVID Relief Legislation Should Be Bipartisan,"

Weekly Update | February 6, 2021
￼

COVID Relief Legislation Should Be Bipartisan

President Biden campaigned on bipartisanship and pledged to lead the country in a unifying way. This latest round of discussions on additional COVID-19 relief will be the president’s first major opportunity to show the American people if he was telling the truth about how he would lead and govern. I know we will have policy disagreements on how to get the country through this pandemic, but as a conservative committed to governing, I believe both parties have an obligation to our constituents to work together and find common ground.

That is why I, and a group of Republican colleagues in the House, sent a letter to President Biden this week urging him to reject efforts to pass a Democrat-only COVID-19 relief plan, and pursue a bipartisan agreement. 

Part of our letter stated, “Bipartisanship is not only essential to delivering an effective response to the pandemic, but to demonstrating our shared commitment to unifying the American people and forging the pathway forward together. With this in mind, we urge your Administration to work with leaders and Members of both parties to advance a bipartisan COVID-19 relief package comprised of consensus-driven policies.” 

Since March, Congress has enacted five bipartisan COVID-19 relief packages developed with bipartisan, bicameral cooperation. Despite strong support now on both sides of the aisle for an additional pandemic relief package that includes funds to strengthen national vaccination and testing programs, immediate assistance to individuals and families, and expanded support for struggling businesses, Democratic Leaders in Congress have signaled they intend to forgo meaningful bipartisan negotiations, resorting instead to the partisan budget reconciliation process. This tool allows spending legislation, such as COVID-19 relief, to be enacted without bipartisan support. 

You can read the full letter here.

Meeting with National Guard Leaders
￼

Pictured above: Rodney greets members of the National Guard from Illinois

This week, I met with leaders of the National Guard providing support to the U.S. Capitol Police, including Major General William Walker, Commanding General for the District Columbia of National Guard, Brigadier General John Driscoll, Task Force Capitol Grounds Commander, and other members of the National Guard.

As last month's events remain fresh on the minds of members, staff, and the American people, we are so grateful to have members of the National Guard assisting the United States Capitol Police continue to secure the Capitol complex. We know the National Guard was ready to immediately assist as rioters approached the Capitol on January 6th, but there was a clear breakdown in the approval process. This failure is just one of the reasons I've called for immediate public hearings to address security operations and for Congress to establish a 9/11-style commission to prevent this from ever happening again. We must understand where the breakdown happened, take steps so this never happens again, and hold anyone responsible for this delay accountable.

Expanding Registered Apprenticeship Programs

This week, I voted in support of the National Apprenticeship Act, which seeks to create nearly 1 million additional apprenticeship opportunities over the next five years.

Registered Apprenticeships are a successful, proven federal workforce training program that creates new, good-paying jobs. That is why I proudly voted in support of this bill. This bipartisan legislation will create nearly 1 million new apprenticeships over the coming years and will offer out-of-work Americans new job opportunities in this struggling economy. We should be doing everything we can to get our economy going again, and that starts by building on what works and enacting job-creating policies.

Grant Awarded to Heritage Behavior Health Center in Decatur

This week, our office announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded a $4,000,000 Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) Expansion Grant to Heritage Behavior Health Center in Decatur. The grant will enable them to become a federally designated CCBHC allowing them to expand their services to integrate primary care alongside critical behavioral health services.

I congratulate Heritage Behavior Health Center on receiving this multi-million dollar federal grant that will allow them to expand their already wide-array of services to the community. It will ensure that those who need access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment will be able to receive it alongside primary health care services. This is a great example of the kind of investments the federal government is making to improve access to care and I’m proud to support it. I've visited Heritage multiple times during my time in Congress and know that they'll put the funding to good use for Decatur and the surrounding communities.

Remembering the Life of Rosemarie Long

I was saddened to learn of the passing of my good friend Rosemarie Long, leader of the Sangamon County Republicans, this week. Rose was a mentor to me and so many others in Sangamon County. She cared deeply about her community and will be sorely missed. I cannot believe she is gone. May God continue to bless her family at this sorrowful time.

I spoke on the House floor to remember the life of Rose. You can watch my full remarks here.

READY TO WORK
￼
Just two weeks after President Biden’s call for unity, Democratic congressional leaders have abandoned the bipartisan cooperation our country needs.
Republicans in Congress are ready to work on commonsense, targeted solutions to get Americans back to work, kids back to school, small businesses back on their feet, and life back to normal. 
But instead, Speaker Pelosi is plowing ahead with budget reconciliation to fast-track a one-sided, $1.9 trillion bill loaded with progressive priorities that will destroy jobs and make it harder for Main Street to rebuild our economy. That’s why I voted against Speaker Pelosi’s partisan budget resolution this week.
￼
Despite President Biden’s words, his administration’s early actions have been aimed at advancing a radical left-wing agenda rather than getting hardworking Americans the help they need.
For instance, he rescinded the pro-life Mexico City Policy, eliminating vital protections against the use of taxpayer dollars to promote abortion.
He banned new oil and gas leasing and drilling on federal lands, setting the stage for a total ban that will cost an estimated one million jobs and drive up the cost of energy for American families and businesses.
And he issued an executive order blocking the Keystone XL pipeline, a decision that puts thousands of jobs at risk. That’s why I’m proud to cosponsor the Keystone XL Pipeline Construction and Jobs Preservation Act, which would save jobs and move America closer to energy independence.
We have an opportunity for bipartisan cooperation to get things done for the American people. It’s time for President Biden and Speaker Pelosi to put politics aside, stop pursuing a radical agenda, and let us get to work.
SAFE & EFFECTIVE VACCINE DEPLOYMENT
￼
I’m fully confident the vaccines approved by the FDA are safe and effective, and they are the key to our nation’s recovery. I will continue working with federal, state, and local officials to ensure vaccine doses are distributed in our communities as efficiently as possible so that together we can defeat this invisible enemy. 
Indiana is continuing its phased plan to administer FDA-approved vaccines, starting with frontline health care workers, residents and staff of long-term care facilities, and now all Hoosiers aged 65 or older.
The state has opened hundreds of vaccination sites with at least one in every country, and so far 661,033 Hoosiers have been vaccinated. Vaccines administered by the state are free to all Indiana residents, but insurance may be charged an administrative fee.
To register and to find the nearest vaccination clinic, call 2-1-1 or visit OurShot.in.gov. The second dose will be scheduled at the clinic when the first dose is administered. A caregiver or loved one also may make an appointment on behalf of an eligible senior.
Attention Hoosier veterans – the St. Joseph County VA Clinic will be providing free COVID-19 vaccinations to veterans by appointment only. For more information or to schedule an appointment, call 1-800-360-8387 ext. 75113.
REMINDER for veterans who have scheduled an appointment – the clinic is providing vaccinations TODAY, February 6th, between 8:00am to 3:30pm ET, at 1540 Trinity Place in Mishawaka.

2/6/21 10:32,Democrats Push Partisan Agenda Under Guise of COVID-19 Relief,"￼ 
DEMOCRATS PUSH PARTISAN AGENDA
UNDER GUISE OF COVID-19 RELIEF

After preaching about the need to unify our nation, this week Democrats laid the groundwork for pushing a massive $1.9 trillion spending bill through a reconciliation process which would allow them to pass their partisan agenda without even having to negotiate with Republicans-- and won’t be subject to a 60-vote threshold in the Senate.

￼

Their “COVID-19 relief” proposal is just a shell budget that would allow Democrats to enact radical policies unrelated to the pandemic. At a time when we are still recovering from the impact of COVID-19, we should be focused on bipartisan policies that spur economic recovery and create jobs – not partisan poison pills.

￼

Introducing Legislation to Expand Student Access to Mental Health Services

We have a mental health crisis among our nation’s youth, and the COVID-19 pandemic and related school closures have taken a toll on our students, only worsening this tragic situation. Schools know best the needs of their student bodies and should have flexibility in how they use funding to better meet those needs. 

￼
Congressman Allen introduces the Expanding Student Access to Mental Health Services Act.

That’s why I introduced the Expanding Student Access to Mental Health Services Act, legislation that provides school districts with increased flexibility in how they can use funds to better provide mental health services for students. You can learn more about the bill here.

Introducing the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act

￼

This week, I introduced the Education Freedom Scholarships and Opportunity Act alongside my House Education and Labor Committee colleague, Rep. Burgess Owens (UT-04). The bill expands quality elementary, secondary, and career and technical education opportunities for students by providing a federal tax credit to encourage individuals and businesses to donate to nonprofit scholarship funds. This is a common-sense way to help some of our most vulnerable students who, without a scholarship, may be unable to afford tuition and other education expenses.

Encouraging Innovation in Apprenticeship Programs

This week House Democrats passed a partisan bill related to apprenticeships that doubles down on burdensome mandates and will prevent many workers from accessing apprenticeship opportunities by imposing a one-size-fits-all federal registered apprenticeship system - while doing nothing to support other models.

￼

I offered an amendment to the bill that would uphold the Trump Administration’s rule regarding the Department of Labor’s Industry-Recognized Apprenticeship Programs, which provide companies an alternative avenue to train skilled workers for their specific industry needs while allowing Americans to earn while they learn. Yet, per usual, my Democratic colleagues blocked my amendment from consideration. As we continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, I will continue to fight for American workers and businesses while encouraging innovation and flexibility into the apprenticeship model so that we can rebuild our economy.

Honoring the Sanctity of Life

This January marked the 48th anniversary of Roe v. Wade. Since that tragic ruling, over 62 million innocent babies have been aborted. I had the honor of speaking on the House floor during a pro-life special order to highlight that all life is precious and worthy of dignity and respect.

￼

In his first days, President Biden rescinded the Mexico City Policy which prevents U.S. tax dollars from financing foreign non-governmental organizations that perform, promote or lobby for abortion. I recently joined several of my House Republican colleagues calling on President Biden to reverse this decision and protect the sanctity of life. Any and all measures that take steps to ensure the life of an unborn child will have my support – and I will adamantly oppose any legislation that promotes or defends such an immoral practice.

Recognizing Augusta Canal’s National Heritage

The Augusta Canal National Heritage Area (ACNHA) is one of 55 areas designated by Congress as a National Heritage Area. The Augusta Canal played a critical role during the Industrial Revolution and is currently the nation’s only industrial power canal still in use for its original purpose. 

￼
Congressman Allen introduces legislation to reauthorize the Augusta Canal as a National Heritage Area

This week I introduced legislation to extend the Augusta Canal’s authorization as a National Heritage Area to commemorate not only its historical significance, but its continued impact to economic development in the CSRA today. You can read more here.

ICYMI: Augusta National Announces COVID-19 Vaccine Effort

As we continue to ramp up COVID-19 vaccine efforts in the 12th District, I’m thankful to Augusta National for their $2 million effort to help the AU Health System by providing 15 vaccination stations that can move through 300-350 people an hour, as well as pop-up clinics in underserved areas and a second mobile clinic.

2/6/21 10:57,Weekly Newsletter,"￼ 


Dear West Virginian,  This week, I joined nine of my Senate Republican colleagues in offering a targeted COVID-19 relief proposal that people across our country urgently need. On Monday evening, we had the chance to discuss this in more detail with President Biden. Our relief proposal included many shared priorities like:  ·      Increasing funding for production and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine;  ·      Providing economic relief for Americans with the greatest need;  ·      Extending enhanced federal unemployment benefits;  ·      Providing nutrition assistance to help struggling families;  ·      Providing additional assistance for our small businesses;  ·      Getting our children safely back to school and ensuring they can stay open;  ·      Increasing resources for child care.  I discussed this proposal and more this week on FOX News and Bloomberg TV.   ￼  To watch one of my interviews, click here or the image above.  However, despite our efforts and the need for COVID-19 relief, Democrats in the Senate chose to use the most partisan method possible to pass a $1.9 trillion budget bill, which included their attempt to provide additional relief for the COVID pandemic. This measure passed without a single Republican vote, and required the Vice President to break a 50-50 tie. Providing COVID-19 relief through this method will take months, when bipartisan agreement could have brought targeted, direct relief to the American people much quicker.  Read more in my full statement here.  Ensuring Transparency and Accountability  This week, the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee had the chance to hear directly from the nominee for U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator, North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Michael Regan.  During the hearing, I focused my questions on the significant impacts overreaching environmental regulations have had on West Virginia’s economy in the past and the need to protect air and water without compromising jobs. I also secured a commitment from Michael Regan to visit states like West Virginia that are directly impacted by the environmental policies—something the Obama-Biden administration neglected to do when it proposed its illegal Clean Power Plan. More details here.   ￼   To watch Senator Capito’s opening statement, click here or the image above.  To watch Senator Capito’s first round of questions, click here.  To watch Senator Capito’s second round of questions, click here.  Great News for Raleigh County!  Earlier this week, Senator Manchin and I announced that the Raleigh County Memorial Airport Industrial Park will receive a $3.5 million award from the U.S Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration (EDA) and the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC). This investment is well deserved, and will bring crucial improvements that will help expand airport operations and capabilities.  This has been a project that I have been dedicated to see trough for several years now. In 2019, I hosted ARC’s Tim Thomas in Beckley to show him the importance of this project to the region, and I am so thrilled to see it finally become a reality. None of this would have been possible without the work of local leaders and economic development councils who have been essential in the planning and advocacy for the investment. Click here for more details.  In Case You Missed It  Now that the new Congress is underway, we have hit the ground running and introduced legislation that will have meaningful impact in West Virginia. In case you missed this, check out the links below for the details:  ·      ACCESS Act   ·      Early Educators Apprenticeship Act   ·      Safe Connections Act   ·      Healthy Food Access for All Americans Act   West Virginia Veterans Upward Bound  Do you have a veteran in your life who is looking to pursue higher education opportunities or brush up on their skills? West Virginia Veterans Upward Bound is dedicate to providing service to veterans in our state, and they are currently looking for referrals for their programs. Whether you’re looking to improve your computer skills, financial literacy, complete a new degree, or seek assistance with financial aid, WVVUB is here to help. Learn more here: https://vubwv.org/   Additional COVID-19 Resources  I created a page on my website with information and resources to keep you up-to-date on the coronavirus situation as it continues to evolve. For example, checks and debit cards are on the way to those eligible as a result of the relief package we passed recently. Check out that page here, and please share with friends so they can keep up with the latest.  In addition to my webpage, I also want to make sure you know where to get the latest updates from the medical experts at CDC.gov and West Virginia DHHR.  I will continue doing my best to keep you up to speed on what we are doing here at the federal level to help and other resources that can be useful back at home.

This Week in Congress
 
 
This week, south Mississippi tragically lost Deputy Lieutenant Michael Boutte of the Hancock County Sheriff's Department. Unfortunately, Lt. Boutte was killed in the line of duty when he was responding to a call on Monday. His end of watch was February 1, 2021. 
 
It is never easy to experience a loss such as this. I have heard and read of the passion and pride Lt. Boutte carried with him in his personal and professional life. While we may never understand the Lord's plan, we take comfort in knowing that Lt. Boutte is surrounded by angels and watching over all of us. 
 
I was honored to lead the House of Representatives in a moment of silence, honoring the life and legacy of Lt. Boutte. You can read or watch my remarks below.   
Madam Speaker,
 
I rise today with a heavy heart. On February first, South Mississippi tragically lost Hancock County Sheriff Deputy Lieutenant Michael Boutte in the line of duty. His end of watch was Monday, February 1, 2021.  
Boutte was a passionate servant in our community, and he will be greatly missed by many. He is remembered for his service, not only as a distinguished law enforcement officer but also as an Air Force veteran who served in Operation Desert Storm. In everything he did, Boutte wore his smile with pride and compassion.  
A tireless leader in his community, Boutte was responsible for organizing the Silver Alert system and National Crime Night Out for the city of Diamondhead. He was also honored with the Life Saving Medal and awarded the Officer of the Year award by the Waveland Community Unity Organization in 2018.  
Boutte made our community and his loved ones immensely proud. Our state and our nation owe him and his family a debt of gratitude for his service and sacrifice. Let us go forth and carry his memory and service in our hearts and prayers.  
If members in the House chamber could please join me for a moment of silence to honor the life of Lieutenant Michael Boutte.  Madam Speaker, thank you. I yield back.   
 
￼
 
 
 Joining the House Energy Action Team
 
I am proud to announce that I have joined the House Energy Action Team (HEAT) in Congress. Our team is a coalition of lawmakers focused on promoting Republican energy policies that will address energy pricing, create new job opportunities, and strengthen our national security through promotion of American energy independence. 
 
Americans need and deserve affordable energy prices, and so far, President Biden's actions are driving up energy costs for consumers. I've worked on oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico and know the real-world impacts of these radical policies. As these attempts to erode America's dominance in the oil and gas industry are sure to continue, I will be actively working with the HEAT team to protect jobs in south Mississippi and advocate for safe and effective energy solutions.  
￼
 
 My Concerns with Biden's Immigration Policies
 
As you know, President Trump prioritized the safety and security of Americans and our borders. Unfortunately, the new Administration is heading in the opposite direction, and it is unsettling. That's why I joined several of my Republican colleagues in Congress in sending a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, expressing concerns over President Biden's immigration-related executive orders. Our letter urges the secretary to enforce the immigration laws passed by Congress, resume construction of the border wall, and continue the Migrant Protection Protocols and the Asylum Cooperative Agreements. 
 
These Executive Orders, as well as recent actions taken by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), will weaken the integrity of our immigration system and encourage aliens to make the dangerous journey to our southern border and attempt to enter the United States illegally.  Full text of our letter can be read here. 
 
Final Note
 
Please know my office remains ready to serve you and the families of Mississippi's Fourth Congressional District. Whether it's writing an email to share your thoughts with me or reaching out for help with a federal agency, we are here for you. Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is anything I can ever do to be of service to you. 
 
Always in your service,
￼
  
Steven

HAPPENING IN THE HOUSE
This week, Congressional Democrats used an FY21 “budget” to enact their radical agenda. Despite calls for unity and bipartisanship, their resolution gives them the ability to pass massive legislation without support from their Republican colleagues. It also suspends the debt limit beyond the ceiling it’s expected to hit this summer. This is irresponsible.
 
The majority should not be steamrolling the minority in order to get what they want. We should be focused on ways we can move our country forward together. 
￼
 Pelosi Democrats also took unprecedented action this week to remove another Member of Congress from a committee. I joined ABC to talk about why this is hypocritical and a big mistake by the radical Left. Click here to watch my full interview.
 
CONGRATULATIONS, SERVICE ACADEMY NOMINEES!
￼
 I was honored to nominate seven students from Oklahoma’s Second Congressional District to our country’s service academies this year. Attending a service academy is an invaluable experience that shapes young men and women into our next generation of leaders. This year, there was more interest than ever in applying to the academies and I wish these students the best as they continue the application process.
 
The list below includes the names, hometowns, and high schools of the students, as well as the academy to which they have been nominated:
 
U.S. Naval Academy
Rowan Howell, Beggs, Okla. – Lakeside High School
Blake Simmons, Muskogee, Okla. – Muskogee High School
Christian Tidwell, McAlester, Okla. – McAlester High School
 
U.S. Air Force Academy
Coby Buck, Durant, Okla. – Calera High School
 
U.S. Military Academy at West Point
Henry Auer, Lenapah, Okla. – Oklahoma Union
Blaine Jones, Tahlequah, Okla. – Tahlequah High School
Bailey Ross, Watts, Okla. – Westville High School
 
PRESIDENT BIDEN’S ASSAULT ON AMERICAN ENERGY 
￼
 It was no secret President Biden planned to destroy the oil and gas industry if elected president and in the first week of his administration, he took action to do just that. American energy production plays a vital role in our country’s job creation and economic growth, especially in Oklahoma. His assault on the oil and gas industry will threaten our national security, raise prices for American families, and kill jobs.
 
With the stroke of a pen, years-worth of progress toward American energy independence was undone. President Biden promised to work for all Americans in his inaugural address, but these unilateral executive actions are taking our country in the wrong direction. I will continue to fight back against these reckless decisions.
 
WHERE ARE YOU IN DISTRICT 2? 
￼
 Communities all across the Second Congressional District of Oklahoma are full of things that make them unique and I want to highlight some of them. Every week on my Facebook page, I will post an up-close photo of a landmark somewhere in the district with a clue to where it is. I encourage everyone to put their best guess in the comments. The correct answer will be right here, in my weekly e-newsletter. 
￼
 Nobody guessed that it is the Johnston County War Memorial in Tishomingo. Claremore “Smokey” Tolbert was the first U.S. Naval Academy graduate to fly with the Blue Angels and he was nominated the academy by the office of Speaker Carl Albert.  
 
WEEKLY WRAP UP
￼
 Our country is about working hard and the entrepreneurial spirit, not the heavy hand of the government that President Biden and Democrats in Congress are trying to force on the American people. Watch this week’s wrap up on Facebook and YouTube.
 
Stay in touch by visiting my Facebook and Twitter pages and as always, don’t hesitate to contact me if I can help in any way.

2/6/21 12:06,Rep. Grothman Newsletter- Tucson Sector,"￼

 
Tuscon Sector
 
U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) divides our Southern border into nine distinct sectors across the four states that border Mexico by land: Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California. Last Saturday, I returned to Wisconsin after visiting our Southern border in the Tucson Sector of Arizona for two days. This was my first trip to our Southern border this year, but I have been several times in the past. I was able to talk to CBP agents and local law enforcement on the ground, whose insight and firsthand experience at the border is invaluable. I was also able to see the border wall system, including the parts that are not yet finished. We call it the border wall system because it is not just a wall, it is also equipped with sensors, cameras and other technology that assists our agent in their job.
 
The Tucson sector is one of the busiest sectors in the country in terms of illegal immigrant apprehensions and marijuana seizures. In 2006, 33 years into his U.S. Senate career, then-Senator Joe Biden said a fence was needed at our Southern border to stop ""tons"" of drugs from Mexico. President Trump improved upon this idea and built a border wall system. We still have drugs, arms and immigrants coming illegally into our country from Mexico, so why has now-President Biden changed his mind about securing our border? His ideas are antithetical to the real-world operations at our border and the needs of the agents patrolling it. I will not stop fighting for a secure border and hope that President Biden will realize that the actual situation at our Southern border is vastly different from the reports laid on his desk by Washington bureaucrats.
 
Nonetheless, the recent sweeping changes out of the Biden White House have made our border less safe. The President has, in his first two weeks on the job, ended construction of the border wall system, ended the Migrant Protection Protocols and has begun a crusade to pause Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportation of illegal immigrants who already have criminal convictions. I oppose all of these ideas, not because of partisan politics, but because they go against what every CBP agent, ICE agent and local law enforcement officer I speak with at the border tells me is helpful to them. I summed up some of my most recent findings from this trip in this video from a section of the wall that will, for now, remain incomplete.
  
 
￼
 
  
 
Immigration Bill
 
Speaking of immigration, this week, I introduced a bill that will require an individual to be a U.S. citizen in order to receive welfare benefits, such as Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps. According to data from the Census Bureau, it is estimated that my legislation would save taxpayers $60 billion in its first year.
 
This bill will help to encourage more hard-working immigrants to come to America, while discouraging those who only seek to come here to take advantage of our welfare state. A study published in 2015 shows that both legal and illegal immigrant households take advantage of the welfare system far more than native-born households. Moreover, Politifact confirms that half of immigrant families receive some form of welfare.
 
In general, the welfare system in America started with good intentions, but it is in need of a major overhaul. We need to clean it up so those who really do need help get it, but those who are able to work are encouraged to. America is a beacon of prosperity throughout the world not because of our generous welfare system, but by how many jobs we provide for those looking for a better life for their family and themselves.
 
Many of President Biden's unilateral, partisan executive actions have made our borders less safe. He has also promoted amnesty for 11 million illegal immigrants, many of whom would use their new legal status to apply for additional welfare benefits. Now that we have a President whose priorities do not lie with the safety and security of our Southern border, we must ensure America’s welfare safety net does not become a magnet for illegal immigration. I want to give every immigrant a hand-up instead of a hand-out so they too can share the dignity that comes with an honest day’s work, just like my ancestors had when they came to this country.

In November, the House passed the National Apprenticeship Act. Since the bill was passed in the 116th Congress and was not signed into law, it had to be re-introduced to the 117th Congress.
 
On Friday, we voted on this bill. I again voted no because the bill was not substantially changed and it will not go far enough to help Wisconsin workers. While there were some good provisions in this bill and the name sounds nice, this bill is inadequate for workers and businesses because it recognizes certain apprenticeships and not others. In particular, many apprenticeships used by the construction industry were intentionally left out by the bill's authors. It is not the job of Congress to pick winners and losers, which is what this bill would do.
 
What Congressional leaders, like Speaker Pelosi, need to do is return to regular order and allow we members of the Committee on Education and Labor to hold hearings on the best ways to expand apprenticeships nationwide. The bill that passed today did not have any hearings and was not ""marked up"" in committee, which means our input as a Committee was denied, which should draw the ire of Republicans and Democrats alike.
 
The only formal public discussion on this bill was the mandatory debate held on the House floor on Friday, just hours before it was passed. You can watch my speech clicking here or on the picture below.

Weekly Roundup
 
I joined this letter because President Biden is making our border less safe with his executive actions and we members of the House Oversight and Reform Committee need to know what conversations he had with cabinet officials before his decision to halt construction of the border wall system.

Dear Friend,
 
This past Wednesday marked the one-month anniversary of my swearing-in to serve the 53rd District in Congress. While my first month didn't start the way I expected – with insurrectionists attacking the U.S. Capitol on my fourth day in office – it is an honor to serve you and all of my constituents.
 
Below are highlights and updates from this past month. Going forward, my team and I will be sending out weekly newsletters to share important updates from San Diego and Washington, D.C. If you know other community members who would enjoy or benefit from these newsletters, please forward this message and encourage them to subscribe at sarajacobs.house.gov. 
 
 
￼
 
 
Committees
 
I am honored to serve on three prestigious House committees: the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, the House Armed Services Committee, and the House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee.
 
The House Committee on Foreign Affairs has jurisdiction over foreign assistance, national security developments affecting foreign policy, war powers and the deployment and use of the U.S. Armed Forces, peacekeeping and sanctions, and arms control and disarmament issues. I am proud to serve on the Subcommittee on International Development, International Organizations, and Global Corporate Social Impact and the Subcommittee on Africa, Global Health, and Global Human Rights.
 
The House Armed Services Committee has jurisdiction over defense policy, ongoing military operations, the organization and reform of the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy, security cooperation, and humanitarian assistance activities. I am proud to serve on the Subcommittee on Military Personnel and the Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Force.
 
The House Democratic Steering and Policy Committee acts on behalf of the Democratic caucus to determine membership and leadership of legislative committees and develop the House Majority’s policy priorities. I serve as the Freshman Representative on that committee, having been unanimously nominated by my freshman colleagues and appointed by Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
 
 
Legislation
 
Since entering Congress, I have co-sponsored 24 pieces of legislation, 10 of which have strong bipartisan support. Those bills and resolutions include:
 
	•	H.Con.Res.9 - Honoring the life and legacy of United States Capitol Police Officer Brian D. Sicknick, who was killed defending the Capitol and our democracy on January 6.
	•	H.R. 7 - The Paycheck Fairness Act, addressing gender-based pay disparities and mandating equal pay for equal work.
	•	H.R. 305 - To award a Congressional Gold Medal to Officer Eugene Goodman, whose quick thinking drew insurrectionists away from the Senate Chamber during the January 6 attack on the Capitol.
	•	H.R. 447 - The National Apprenticeship Act, creating one million additional apprenticeship opportunities over the next five years. This bill was originally introduced by my predecessor, Congresswoman Susan Davis.
	•	H.R. 695 - The USPS Fairness Act, repealing the requirement that the United States Postal Service must prepay future retirement benefits for 75 years. The existing requirement, which was enacted by Congress in 2006, is one of the leading causes of the Postal Service's financial difficulties.
 
On January 13, I gave my first speech on the House floor in favor of H.Res. 24, impeaching President Donald Trump for high crimes and misdemeanors. Political violence must always be met with accountability — because without accountability, more violence will follow. That's what I learned during my service at the State Department and the United Nations, and it's what is necessary to protect our democracy.
 
 
￼
 
On February 1, Congresswoman Nikema Williams and I introduced legislation - H.Res. 83 - to censure and condemn Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene and call for her resignation. Congresswoman Greene has repeatedly expressed her support for assassinating elected leaders and has spread harmful conspiracy theories that denigrate the victims of 9/11, the Sandy Hook and Parkland school shootings, and the California wildfires. She has repeatedly made threats against other Members of Congress and is unfit to serve.
 
 
Letters
 
This month, I also joined my colleagues in signing on to more than a dozen letters sent to Congressional leadership and the Biden Administration to make our priorities for the early days of the 117th Congress known. Those include:
	•	With Congressman Ruben Gallego, a letter to then-Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller encouraging an investigation to identify any current members of the military who participated in the attack on the Capitol and to hold them accountable to the highest level under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). 
	•	With the Democratic Women's Caucus, a letter to President Biden encouraging the inclusion of $100 billion in reconciliation packages to not only stabilize child care for families and early educators, but also lay the groundwork for moving toward universal child care and early learning.
	•	With Congressmen Peters, Vargas, and Levin, a letter to President Biden requesting that he direct the Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs to share actionable data on vaccinations with San Diego County and the State of California to ensure servicemembers, veterans, and civilian employees are counted in our total vaccination data.
	•	With Congressman Raul Ruiz, a letter to Speaker Pelosi and Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth urging the inclusion of a pathway to citizenship for essential immigrant workers and their families, Dreamers, and TPS holders in the COVID-19 reconciliation recovery package given that essential immigrant workers have been key to the health and safety of all Americans during the pandemic.
 
COVID Relief
 
This week, Congress voted to pass H.Con.Res. 11, the fiscal year 2021 budget resolution — a key tool to accelerate the passage of another COVID relief bill. Passing the budget ensures that Congress can act quickly and decisively in the weeks to come to deliver the robust relief that American families, workers, and small businesses need to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and rebuild our economy.
 
In anticipation of that work, I visited a number of small businesses and non-profits with the Equality Business Alliance to hear what they need in the next COVID relief bill. 
 
 
￼
￼
 
I visited the UCSD Health Vaccination Super Station at Petco Park, the Rady Children’s Community Vaccination Clinic, and the Sharp/Chula Vista Super Vaccination Site to talk about how we can accelerate vaccine distribution. 
 
I also had the opportunity to visit a child care provider in Chula Vista and saw firsthand how providers are keeping San Diego kids active and safe.
 
Finally, I met with representatives of PATH San Diego, the San Diego River Foundation, and Kaiser to talk more about our region's homelessness crisis and their work to help people experiencing homelessness who live along the San Diego River. It will be vitally important that our vulnerable populations also receive support in the next relief bill and that our federal response is committed to ending homelessness.

Dear Lindsey,

I wanted to take a moment to share with you a recap of what happened in the month of January in Texas' 22nd District and the United States House.

Peaceful Transition of Power
On January 21, 2021, we witnessed another peaceful transition of power from President Trump to now President Biden. I'm forever grateful for President Trump's service to our nation and all he did to restore the American dream. 

My Freshman Committee Assignments
I was proud to receive both of my committee assignments which will provide me the opportunity to focus on pivotal issues we all care about like highway development, flood mitigation, and taking care of our veterans.
	•	House Committee on Transportation & Infrastructure
	•	House Committee on Veterans' Affairs

Biden's Executive Overreach
President Trump and President Obama in their first 30 days issued 27 executive orders COMBINED. Since taking office on January 21, 2021, President Biden has exceeded President Obama and President Trump combined issuing over 28 executive orders. Many of these are job crippling, government growing orders. He has issued numerous orders that attack our hardworking oil and gas workers at a time when our economy is struggling due to COVID-19. We should be focused on putting Americans back to work, not out of work. I will stand strong in Congress and support our American workers. 

District Office is Open
Our new district office is open! The office is located at 1117 FM 359, Ste 210, Richmond, TX 77406. Come by anytime Monday through Friday 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM and we'll be happy to serve you anyway we can. 

What do you think?
With the start of a new Congress and Administration, I want to hear what your priority is. Please participate in the survey included in this email.
 
Follow my Facebook and Twitter accounts for updates. It's an honor to represent you and the great state of Texas in the United States House of Representatives.

INVITE: LET’S TALK ABOUT MONTHLY RELIEF FOR FAMILIES
Dear friend, 
Since the pandemic began, poverty in the U.S. has risen sharply. We need proven solutions to tackle this crisis and help rebuild the middle class, which is why I am fighting for a plan that would give families up to $300 per month per child to help buy groceries, pay for rent, and afford other essentials. I am hopeful that my colleagues in Congress will include key provisions of my proposal in President Biden’s COVID-19 relief bill. 
Curious? Have questions? On Monday at 4 pm PT, I will be talking to Elyssa Schmier from MomsRising about how this plan will help families during the pandemic and the long-term plan to lift millions of children out of poverty.

Dear Friend,

I have always kept one motto in my heart as I approach the job of being your representative: Put people before politics. Unfortunately, what we are seeing from the Leaders of the Democratic party is the exact opposite; it is all politics.

This week, Washington Democrats made clear that for all President Biden’s talk of unifying the country, these words were all hat and no cattle. In their first chance to show the country how we can work together, Democrats chose to pass a Budget Resolution that will only go to rescue or reward their political allies in blue state capitals across the country. The plan will ram down billions of dollars in bailouts they have proposed for state governments that have locked down their local economies, told main street to board up, and left families struggling even more to make ends meet. This is wrong...KEEP READING HERE

WHAT'S GREAT IN THE 8TH 

￼

COVID-19 vaccines have arrived in Southern Missouri and several counties have started vaccinating those that are eligible. Please consult CDC.gov/coronavirus for eligibility requirements and check HERE for updates on vaccination sites near you. 

￼

James and Doug Bieller were recognized for their soybean, corn, and wheat farm which has been in their family for over 100 years. Part of what makes Southern Missouri so great are successful family farms like the Bieller's.

￼

The Kennett Police Department held a pinning ceremony to reward several of their officers with a promotion for their hard work and dedication. Congratulations to all awarded officers, and thank you Kennett PD for your continued investment in the safety of our communities.

￼

Area high schools gathered at the St. Vincent De Paul Parish in Perryville for the first annual March for Life Day on Friday. Pro-life activist and musician Tony Melendez gave the keynote address, where he spoke about his life and sang for the group.



 IN CASE YOU MISSED IT

￼
 
I had the opportunity to join John McArdle from the Washington Journal to discuss the outlandish so-called 2021 budget that Congressional Democrats pushed throught the House this week. 

￼

This week I spoke on the House floor in opposition of the blank check Democrat's wrote to fund their progressive wish-list. Their plan for 2021 would dedicate trillions to additional stimulus and further bailout state governments that have forced small businesses to close down, have kept children out of schools and citizens out of their houses of worship.

￼

I was joined by Rep. Jim Jordan and Rep. Tim Burchett on NewsMax TV to discuss Nancy Pelosi and her party trivializing the needs of Americans to pursue a purely political agenda. 

 
 LEGISLATIVE UPDATE

H.Con. Res. 11: A $1.9 trillion budget that Mr. Biden and my democrat colleagues intend to use bailing out leftist run cities and states that have suffered under irresponsible leadership.
PASSED, REP. SMITH VOTED NO.

H.R. 447: Expands the size of government and requires businesses to follow one-size-fits-all federal standards for registered apprenticeships. 
PASSED, REP. SMITH VOTED NO.

Update on COVID 
Spending Proposals
Congress has spent an unprecedented amount of taxpayer money - approximately $4 trillion - on COVID-19 relief aid. The staggering amount is on par with the size of the entire annual federal budget and is equal to about a quarter of our entire annual economy. Moreover, billions of authorized aid remains unspent.
The economy has rebounded well since last April. The unemployment rate has fallen by more than half of what it was then and savings and disposable income rates are currently at or near record high levels. Another round of stimulus checks and other aid will not address the biggest problem facing Americans - concerns about traveling, socializing, and dining out during the pandemic. Getting the vaccine into peoples' arms as quickly as possible does. This is what the federal government must be focused on. Once we've made significant progress on this goal, then Congress can revisit what pockets of the economy still require assistance.
I hope you will take a few minutes to watch the floor speech I delivered this week about the next steps I think Congress should take when it comes to another COVID relief package.

Celebrating Catholic Schools
As a Catholic school parent and graduate, I know firsthand the great work they do. Not only do Catholic schools provide students with an exceptional education, but they help students build a foundation of values. This past year, they've faced unprecedented challenges due to COVID-19, but they've stepped up to provide students with a safe, flexible, and high-quality learning experience. I was proud to support a resolution this week to designate January 31-February 6 National Catholic Schools Week.

Update on COVID-19
In the past few weeks, Pennsylvania and the rest of the country have experienced a concerning jump in new COVID-19 cases. While vaccines are now available, the threat of this virus is still very real.
It remains important that people continue to follow CDC recommendations: adhere to social distancing guidelines, wash your hands often, and wear a mask if you are heading out. Remember: my mask protects you and your mask protects me.
According to the Pennsylvania Department of Health, across the state as of Friday, February 5, 2021:
	•	Over 16% of all hospital beds were available (pre-COVID, approximately 36.82% of hospital beds were typically available)
	•	Over 73% of ventilators were available
	•	Over 19% of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds were available (pre-COVID, approximately 32.6% of ICU beds were typically available)
As of that date, positive cases in Pennsylvania reached 861,674, roughly a 0.5% increase from the prior day, and more than 3,678,224 tests had come back negative. This means just over 81% of Pennsylvanians tested for COVID-19 had a result that came back negative.

For more detailed information about resources available to you, visit the COVID-19 resource page on my website.

Futher Information:

The Centers for Disease Control provides updates on the virus and safety information for the public and healthcare professionals here.

The Pennsylvania Department of Health provides information on the virus and safety precautions here.

I encourage all Pennsylvanians to take this situation very seriously and observe the recommendations developed by the CDC.

THE BUDGET

This week, Democrats passed a budget to trigger a process called reconciliation. Reconciliation allows Democrats to pass President Biden's wasteful $1.9 trillion stimulus plan on partisan lines. Americans and small businesses need help as we continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, but there is still $1 trillion left from previous stimulus bills Congress has passed. 

In this episode of Buddy's Briefing, we explain the reconciliation process and more.

HONORING A HERO
Also this week, we honored Officer Brian Sicknick as he laid in honor in the U.S. Capitol. He will forever be remembered as a hero and his sacrifice will never be forgotten. 

￼
We continue to pray for his family, friends and colleagues.

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCXCVIII

Monday, February 1, 2021:   I’m in our Savannah office this morning as I have the opportunity to meet with representatives from Skalar Pharma, LLC, an American pharmaceutical company that manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients (API). 
￼
Rep. Carter meeting with Skalar Pharma, LLC. 
Next, I have a call with our new White House liaison who happens to be from Georgia and has a home on St. Simons Island in our district.  After a great introductory call, I join an Energy and Commerce (E&C) GOP Health Subcommittee virtual call where we discuss issues we want to bring up in the subcommittee this year.  Afterwards, I join in on our daily all-staff conference call before heading out to Nightingale Homecare, Infusion and Pharmacy Services in Savannah where they are administering the COVID19 vaccine. 
￼
Rep. Carter visits Nightingale Homecare, Infusion and Pharmacy Services
Nightingale offers personal support, skilled nursing and respite care and is currently administering both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines to patients throughout South Georgia.  This family owned business originated in Savannah and is providing a great service during this pandemic with the vaccine administration.  Afterwards, I head to Waycross in Ware County where I attend the visitation services for Mr. Burton Carter, who passed away last week.  Mr. Carter, a long time Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT) employee, served on the Ware County Board of Commissioners and was actively involved in the community.  

Tuesday, February 2, 2021:  I am happy to join my good friends, Butch Hubbard and Bob Morgan, on the World Famous Butch and Bob show on WIFO in Jesup this morning as we discuss issues in Washington including impeachment and the executive orders that President Joe Biden has issued in his first full week in office.  Afterwards, I head to Richmond Hill in Bryan County where I attend the visitation service for Will Ingram, a veteran of our military who was a civilian engineer at Fort Stewart.  Next, I have a phone conference with E&C Oversight and Investigations (O&I) Subcommittee GOP members to discuss today's hearing on vaccine distribution and administration in the states before heading to Hinesville in Liberty County where I meet with my good friend, Hinesville Mayor Allen Brown, as he brings me up to date on all the good things happening in the area.  Next, I join in on the virtual meeting of the E&C O&I Subcommittee.  Although I do not serve on this subcommittee, I am allowed to waive on to this hearing to ask questions of the expert panel in regards to the distribution and administration of the COVID-19 vaccine.  Later, I head to the airport for my flight to Washington and, once I am at the Capitol, I have a Whip Team conference call before heading to the House Chamber for our first vote series of the week.  

Wednesday, February 3, 2021:   I head to the Capitol Rotunda first thing this morning where I pay my respects to Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who was killed during the riots at the Capitol on January 6th. 
￼
Rep. Carter pays respects to Officer Brian Sicknick
After this very emotional visit, I head to the Cannon House Office Building where I attend the organizing meeting for the Budget Committee.  Each of the major committees in Congress have a representative on the Budget Committee and I have been appointed to represent the E&C Committee.  I am excited for this opportunity.  Next, I head back to my office where I join in on our daily all-staff conference call before logging in on an E&C Health Subcommittee hearing on ramping up COVID-19 vaccines, testing and the medical supply chain.  A link to my questions during the hearing can be found here. 
￼
Rep. Carter speaks on the Budget Resolution
After joining in on a Morehouse School of Medicine town hall virtual meeting where we discuss cannabinoid and endocannabinoid research, I head to a conservative Republican Study Committee meeting before heading to the House Chamber where I speak on the budget that is being debated now.  A link to my comments can be found here.  Next, I head to the Longworth House Office Building where I record a public service announcement (PSA) video assuring people that the COVID-19 vaccine is both safe and effective before heading to what turns out to be a four-hour long GOP Conference meeting.  During the marathon conference we break for about 30 minutes and head to the House Chamber where we have our first and only vote series of the day. 
￼
Rep. Carter films a PSA encouraging Americans to get the COVID-19 vaccine
After the conference, I head back to my office where I have the honor of virtually joining the University of Georgia College Republicans as I am the guest speaker at their monthly meeting. 

Thursday, February 4, 2021:  We have our organizational meeting for the Doctor’s Caucus this morning and this session we elect as our co-chairs, Rep. Andy Harris (R-MD), an anesthesiologist, and Rep. Brad Wenstrup (R-OH), a podiatrist.  Our numbers in the Doctor’s Caucus have grown significantly this session and we have been successful in placing our members on key committees in Congress.  Afterwards, I head to the House Chamber where I pay tribute to Dr. Karla Sapp, Ken Griner, Sen. Mack Mattingly, and Stephen Tootle.  A link to my tributes can be found here, here, here and here.  Once back in my office, I have a virtual call with representatives from the National District Attorneys Association before having a Facetime call with Ryan Beamon, a student at Savannah Country Day School (SCDS) as I surprise him with the news that he has received an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy.  After our weekly Georgia delegation lunch, I join in on an E&C Consumer Protection and Commerce (CPAC) Subcommittee meeting where we discuss fighting fraud and scams during the pandemic.  A link to my questions can be found here. 
￼
Rep. Carter hosts a telephone town hall with special guest Rep. Jason Smith
Next, I head to the House Chamber for our first vote series of the day and, after working in my office, head back to the House Chamber for more votes.  Once back in my office, I have a phone conference with Dr. Chris Shuren with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to discuss the status of over the counter hearing aid regulations.  Afterwards, I have a Telephone Town Hall with my special guest, Rep. Jason Smith (R-MO), who is the Ranking Member of the Budget Committee, before heading back to the House Chamber for our third and final vote series of the day.

Friday, February 5, 2021:  I’m on the radio early this morning as I join my good friend, Bill Edwards, on Newstalk 1290 in Savannah as we discuss yesterday's action by the Democratic majority to strip my Georgia colleague, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, of her committee assignments due to social posts and comments she made prior to her being elected to Congress.  Afterwards, I head to an E&C GOP full committee planning session before heading to the House Chamber where I speak in opposition to the National Apprenticeship Act. 
￼
Rep. Carter speaks on the National Apprenticeship Act
A link to my comments can be found here. Next, I head to the Capitol grounds overlooking the National Mall where I film this week’s edition of Buddy’s Briefing before heading back to the office where I join in on our daily all-staff conference call.  Next, I have a virtual interview with Gray TV to discuss the budget process and how the Democrats are using budget reconciliation to pass the next COVID-19 relief package before heading to the House Chamber for our first of 6 votes today.  In between the votes, I head back to my office where I have a virtual interview with WTOC-TV in Savannah to discuss the budget process and actions taken to strip Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) of her committee assignments.  Once our vote series is completed, I head to the airport for my return trip home.

February 7, 2021
 

Dear Neighbor, 
 
Today is the big day! Best of luck to our very own Tampa Bay Buccaneers as they compete in the first ever Hometown Super Bowl! I know many of us are looking forward to an exciting evening for our favorite team and our community. I predict a big Bucs’ win!
 
Unfortunately, I am not so optimistic about the American people continuing to win under this new administration. Our country has serious problems and remains deeply divided. We need to come together and find areas of agreement rather than continuing to stoke political division. However, since taking office, President Biden has unilaterally taken 42 Executive actions on highly controversial issues which further divide our nation. This is far more than his recent predecessors in either party. 
 

Now, he and Congressional Democrats are contemplating the use of a special budget procedural maneuver to avoid having to negotiate with Republicans on another new stimulus package. While more targeted relief measures may indeed be needed to improve vaccine distribution and help those who are still struggling to recover from the pandemic, there has not even been a serious discussion about how much of the billions of dollars of federal funding already allocated has yet to be dispersed. Consider these important figures:

First Pandemic Supplemental - $8 billion 
Families First Coronavirus Response Act-$192 billion 
CARES Act- $1.72 trillion 
Paycheck Protection Program and Health-$483 billion 
Consolidated Appropriations Act FY 2021- $1,043 trillion 
Proposed New Biden Stimulus - $1.9 trillion
Higher Debt Interest from 5 previous and 1 proposed pandemic relief measure- $400 billion 
Total Allocated and Proposed Measures- $5,747 trillion 
Total Amount of Previously Allocated Funds Already Dispersed - ? 

We have not examined which prior relief programs are working and those which are not reaching targeted goals. For example, I am a strong supporter of public education. We have allocated billions of funding to help students safely return to the classroom and yet more than half of the states in our country have not reopened in-person learning sites. In Florida, we followed the science and school has been back in session all year. The science said it was relatively safe to have students and teachers return to the classroom, with appropriate safeguards in place, especially when weighed against the very real socio-emotional and educational concerns associated with not re-opening in person learning opportunities. We have seen very few problems with COVID-19 transmission in our classrooms, but the burden of managing that process and paying for those safeguards has largely fallen to state and local governments. We have not seen a large influx of federal funding to support the safeguards that were necessary to re-open classrooms, even though billions of dollars have been allocated. It is logical to ask where the allocated funds have gone and why we need to appropriate $170 billion more for education through this new stimulus proposal, especially if there are not imminent plans to follow the science and immediately re-open schools throughout the country.  

Last week, I joined my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee to officially request this type of information of the Biden Administration. Informed decision-making is critical for ensuring that any future legislative measures will meet the needs that exist. Instead of asking these important questions, the relief measure being pushed quickly through Congress ushers in long-standing Democratic priorities such as bailing out local and state governments for non-pandemic expenses, raising the federal minimum wage, and extending federal unemployment benefits through the end of 2021.    

The actions taken during the past two weeks do not reflect a commitment to heal the nation and find common ground.  I remain focused on working across party lines to find common sense solutions that will help all Americans during this difficult time.
 
Please continue reading for some important information. 
 

Vaccinating Seniors and Strengthening our Medical Supply Chain
    
I know that the vaccination distribution process continues to be confusing and frustrating for many local seniors. Currently, it is important to realize that seniors have a few primary options for getting a vaccination. If they live in Pasco, they can register through the Pasco health department's CDR system and then log in to try to obtain an appointment once those slots are released on Sundays at 2:00 p.m. They can also pre-register through the state's new process, reserve their space in line for a vaccine and be notified when a dose is available. I was relieved to see Pinellas County announce improvements to its vaccination process. Hopefully these changes will make it easier for seniors. Additionally, Publix locations in Pasco and Pinellas are now offering seniors the COVID-19 vaccine. You can learn more about how to register through Publix here. I am continuing to share your feedback with the state and local officials who have jurisdiction over this process and believe it will continue to improve. 

As noted in this local news report, I am glad to see that the state of Florida received more than 300,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine last week- a more than 40,000 increase from our previous weekly allocation from the federal government. I will continue to advocate for additional doses for Florida, and for an expansion of the federal pharmacy program.  

As part of the federal effort to expand access to the COVID-19 vaccine and after months of groundwork, the CDC has activated the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program. While additional details are still being finalized, an initial one million doses of vaccine will be sent to participating pharmacies around the nation on February 11th. Participating pharmacies in Florida include: Publix; Walmart and Southeastern Grocers. This program will run in tandem with the Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program, a program used to prioritize vaccination of seniors in long-term care facilities. It is separate from the allocation each state is receiving from the federal government for distribution. These state allocations are currently being distributed through a variety of locations including: local health departments, state sites, and Publix. I will continue to support all efforts to increase circulation of the vaccine to Floridians and will share more information when it becomes available.

Many constituents have asked how people under 65 with severe medical conditions can sign up for COVID-19 vaccination. Here is some limited information. Once more information is available, I will share it. 

During last week’s Health Subcommittee hearing, I discussed the work being done to improve seniors’ access to a COVID-19 vaccine and the fact that our state needs more doses for distribution. I also highlighted the need to modernize our nation’s emergency supply chain to ensure we are less dependent on foreign governments during future emergencies. Click here to listen to my exchange with panelists.  
 
 

Consumer Protection Connection
 
During this week’s kick off meeting of the Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee, we examined the scams that bad actors have used during the COVID pandemic to exploit seniors and other vulnerable populations. During my remarks, I highlighted the disgusting example in Pasco County in which someone made a fake Eventbrite account to sell phony vaccine appointments to seniors. We must do all we can to educate vulnerable populations about these duplicitous scams, put safeguards in place to protect the public, and prosecute those who perpetrate these crimes. Click here to listen to my remarks. 
Sadly, this local news report highlights how scammers are seeking to exploit vulnerable populations desperate to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine. Remember, by law, all COVID-19 vaccines are to be made available free of charge, without co-payments or deductibles, including for those who are uninsured. 

Additionally, this story serves as a good reminder that exploitation often comes from unexpected sources. Remember, nursing home and ALF providers are not legally allowed to take seniors’ stimulus checks. Any incidence of theft should be reported to the Florida Attorney General’s office.  
 
 

Fighting Childhood Cancer
 
Pediatric cancer remains the number one disease that leads to the death of American children. While survival rates have improved for some types of pediatric cancers, thousands of children are lost to cancer each year and many more encounter life threatening complications related to harsh chemotherapies. Children have significantly fewer treatment options than adults and oftentimes must rely on treatment regimens developed for adults because pediatric-specific treatments simply do not exist for many pediatric cancers and rare diseases. 
 
The Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is working to facilitate a better understanding of pediatric cancers and holds the promise for the development of better treatments and possible cures. As a longtime advocate for children and rare disease patients, I was proud to co-author bipartisan legislation last week which will provide a new funding source for this successful program.  

Specifically, our new bill will redirect penalties levied against pharmaceutical, cosmetic, supplement, and medical device companies by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act (FCPA) towards the Kids First program. In recent years, hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties have been levied against these companies, and the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act 2.0 will help channel those funds directly to critical medical research focused on children. 
 
 

Facilitating Economic Recovery

Right now, we should be focused on helping Americans get back to work, rebuild their businesses, and safely send their children back to school.  I am disappointed to see so many Executive Actions taking us in the opposite direction. 
 

However, we are seeing some encouraging signs for our local economy. For example, I am glad to see projections that our local housing market will continue to remain strong this year.  
 

Additionally, the recent announcement of Moffitt’s new research facility in Pasco County is another exciting economic development opportunity for our entire region. Moffitt's expansion project is expected to support 14,500 new jobs and will help the hospital continue critical research as it seeks to prevent and cure cancer. 
 
 

Protecting our Children 
 
There is no higher priority than keeping our children safe. By providing high quality screening and prevention training to school staff and peers, we can identify threats before they materialize, and ensure that those who are at risk get the mental health treatment they need. I have seen first-hand how effective these programs can be when I visited a high school in Pinellas which has already implemented these best practices. Sadly, some communities in my district are among those with the highest suicide rates in our state, and the pandemic has only exacerbated the problem. With training like this, we can help reverse that troubling trend, which is why my colleagues and I re-introduced the STAND-UP Act last week. Click here to learn more.  
 
 

Helping our Heroes

Veteran unemployment rates have been disproportionately high throughout the pandemic. I am hosting a Veteran Employment Fair later this month in order to connect Veterans, Guard and Reserve members and spouses of Veterans and active duty personnel with available positions in our community. Please feel free to share this information as appropriate. 
 
 

Community Concentration 

My team recently had the opportunity to participate in a briefing on Human Trafficking which featured speakers from the FBI, U.S. Attorney’s Office- Middle District and Department of Homeland Security. These agencies are working in a coordinated manner to identify cases and support victims. Unfortunately, studies have shown that human trafficking rates historically spike when cities host large-scale events. As we prepare to host today’s Super Bowl, we can all do our part to remain alert and report any suspicious activity to law enforcement. 
 

My team had the privilege of participating in the recent graduation of the Pasco County Housing Authority’s Self Sufficiency Program. Every program graduate was able to leverage the skills learned to realize the dream of home ownership. Congratulations to each of these families and best wishes for your continued success.﻿
 

Additionally, my team enjoyed participating in the Grand Opening of HD Real Estate Company with the North Tampa Bay Chamber last week. Congratulations to owner Ray Hendricks and best wishes on his continued success. 
 
 

Constituent Corner

I recently received this message from a constituent in my district. 

On Friday January 22nd, we sent a letter requesting the Congressman’s assistance with resolving a delay in our son’s security clearance. Our son called us the following Tuesday to report that he’d been given his clearance! Not even two full business days later!  At first, we thought it must just be a coincidence, but no, it was one phone call from the Congressman’s office!  If that’s not amazing, I don’t know what is! Congressman Bilirakis and his staff care and get things done. We are thankful to have him to call upon in a situation like this where you feel like you have no control and there’s nothing you can do. Maybe we can’t, but he sure can! Thank-you Congressman Bilirakis and all the hard-working and caring staff in your office. Especially Rob, who reached out to follow-up with us.  We are truly grateful. 

This is just one example of the work we do each day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!

Sincerely,

Dear Friend,  
I am happy to return to your inbox with my new newsletter!
 
I am thrilled to announce that I have been selected to serve on the esteemed United States House Ways and Means Committee. As the first West Virginia Representative to sit on the Committee in 72 years, I will continue to advocate for the modernization and revitalization of our region through increased foreign investment and trade. I look forward to working with my fellow Committee members to advance policies on trade, taxes, and health care that affect West Virginians every day.
 
January was a challenging month for our country. Violence of any kind has no place in the United States of America. I thank you for your prayers and support on that awful day for democracy.
 
One silver lining of last month was that I had the chance to meet with the West Virginia National Guard while they were in Washington protecting the Capitol. From safeguarding Congress, to vaccinating West Virginians, thank you for all you do to keep us safe. Keep up the good work!
 
￼
 
I am so proud that West Virginia is leading the nation in COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Governor Justice and our National Guard have done a phenomenal job with this effort, which is why I led a letter with my West Virginia colleagues to the Biden Administration asking that it prioritize our state in the next vaccine allocation. We must provide our high-risk citizens, frontline workers, and all who are eligible with this vaccine. Read my full letter here.
 
Back at home, we officially made the New River Gorge a National Park and Preserve! The New River Gorge is home to everything West Virginia has to offer -- our beauty, small businesses, and adventurous tourism opportunities. I am so excited about this new designation that will preserve and protect the New River Gorge for generations to come.
 
I promise to never stop fighting for you, your family, and your businesses. With your help, we will continue to make West Virginia the best state in the nation to live, work, and raise a family.
 
You, and those around you, will be in my prayers. Please reach out to any of my offices if we can be of assistance.
 
Sincerely,

Congress Needs to Stop Wasting Time and Do Their Jobs

Friends,
 
I hoped to spend this past week working in DC with my colleagues on the most pressing issues Americans are facing today, including: a new COVID-19 relief package, getting our kids back to school, and boosting vaccine distribution.  
 
But unfortunately, I wasn't able to spend nearly enough time on these crucial challenges. 
 
Our time on YOUR dime was wasted talking about the loudest, most unhinged voices in the room. Frankly, this week in Washington was like watching an episode of Jerry Springer.  
 
To be clear, the embrace of QAnon, conspiracy theories, or any other extreme, racist, bigoted, or violent views will always get a forceful condemnation from me. Like many of you, I firmly believe such toxic rhetoric and behavior has absolutely zero place in America, let alone in Congress. I've condemned Members who peddle this lunacy, no matter their party, at every opportunity.  
 
I am tired of wasting the time you pay me to use to address the serious challenges facing our nation. It’s past-time to prioritize the needs of everyday hard-working Americans. It’s time to get to work. 
 
Sincerely, 
￼

CONGRESSWOMAN MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR'S WEEKLY UPDATE

This week, I participated in my very first Committee hearings on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the House Committee on Small Business. 

On the Foreign Affairs Committee, I opposed the slashing of the Western Hemisphere subcommittee. Did you know that Miami's largest trading partners are ALL in the Western Hemisphere? Brazil, Colombia, Canada, Mexico, and Chile. This is offensive to our community. In fact, The Miami Herald published an article about this deeply disturbing move to cut this subcommittee in half. 

I will always fight tirelessly for our American values of freedom, democracy, and respect for Human Rights. Pursue sanctions against the brutal regimes in Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua and strengthen our relationships with our allies and regional partners like Israel, Colombia, and Taiwan. 

On the Small Business Committee, I was selected to serve as the Ranking Member on the Subcommittee on Contracting & Infrastructure. In this role, I'll have the opportunity to guide our community through the burdensome federal government procurement process. I am absolutely committed to working in a bipartisan fashion to assist our struggling small business owners and deliver COVID-19 relief as soon as possible. From Flagler St to Calle Ocho and from Collins Avenue to Miracle Mile, our small businesses have been seriously impacted by the pandemic and I will never stop fighting for our local job creators. 
￼

I look forward to continue addressing your cases, reading your letters, and responding to your comments on Social Media. Please continue to let me know what your thoughts are and never hesitate to reach out to my office. My team is more than happy to assist you with any of your concerns and guide you through any challenges you may have with our federal agencies. 

It is truly the honor of a lifetime to fight for YOU in the halls of Congress.

I WAS SELECTED AS THE RANKING MEMBER ON THE SUBCOMITTEE ON CONTRACTING & INFRASTRUCTURE
￼

Honored to share with you all that I was selected by my colleagues to serve as the Ranking Member on the House Small Business Subcommittee on Contracting & Infrastructure! 

I will fight tirelessly so that our local job creators can access our federal procurement programs!

I SPOKE TO TELEMUNDO's NATIONAL NETWORK
￼

Always great to speak to my friend and colleague, Cristina Londoño, with whom I worked with at several national television stations during my days as a journalist. Always great to share my priorities with Telemundo's audience and our many Spanish-speaking constituents in our district. 

I VOTED FOR THE NATIONAL APPRENTICESHIP ACT 
￼

I helped to expand the National Apprenticeship Program and help get Americans Back to work. 

I voted for this legislation because it focuses on increasing access to education and skills training, promoting entrepreneurship, and strengthening infrastructure. 

This bill will invest over $3.5 billion to provide nearly one million new apprenticeship opportunities and update the original National Apprenticeship Act to meet twenty-first century standards. 

This will assist our efforts to get South Floridians back to work

Friends,
Black history is American history. This Black History Month, we honor the contributions, achievements, and influence of those who came before us and shaped America into the nation we are today.
Dr. Matilda Arabelle Evans was born in Aiken, South Carolina in 1872.  In 1897, she became the first African American woman licensed as a physician in South Carolina.She opened Columbia's first hospital for African-Americans and fought to provide free medical exams for public schoolchildren. She also had a thriving independent practice where she cared for patients of all classes and color. Six children were abandoned at her practice and she raised them all, along with five children orphaned by relatives who had died. Dr. Evans was elected president of the Palmetto State Medical Society and vice president of the National Medical Association, and in World War I was appointed to the Volunteer Medical Service Corps.

Covid-19 Vaccines
 
 
Beginning Monday, February 8, any South Carolina resident aged 65 or older, regardless of health status or preexisting conditions, can begin scheduling their appointment to receive COVID-19 vaccine.

Ways and Means Subcommittees
 
 
I look forward to continuing to serve on the Select Revenue Measures and Trade Subcommittees, and I am honored to have the opportunity to serve on the Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee. My focus in Congress has always been American Competitiveness. I’ll continue to use my experience as a CPA and tax lawyer to tackle issues that matter to the 7th District of South Carolina and the US, including job creation, increasing opportunity, and growing our economy.
The House Committee on Ways and Means is the oldest committee of the United States Congress, the only one specifically mentioned in the Constitution, and is the chief tax-writing committee in the House of Representatives.  The Committee exercises jurisdiction over revenue and related issues such as tariffs, reciprocal trade agreements and the bonded debt of the United States.  Revenue-related aspects of the Social Security system, Medicare and social services programs also fall within the Ways and Means’ purview.

Diabetes Caucus
 
 
I recently joined the Diabetes Caucus! Approximately 500,000 South Carolinians have diabetes, and it is the 7th leading cause of death in South Carolina. I look forward to working on legislative activities that would improve diabetes research, education and treatment.

Have a great week!

Sincerely,

Friends,

It’s become increasingly clear that the number one need right now in the battle against COVID-19 is vaccine distribution. It's critical that Congress act quickly to address this need - the lives and livelihoods of the American people are at stake.
￼

That's why my colleagues and I on the Problem Solvers Caucus called for an immediate vote on a standalone ""Defeating COVID-19"" vaccination distribution package.

The reality is that billions of dollars from the previous COVID relief packages remain unspent. So, instead of wasting our time with a partisan back and forth on yet another stimulus bill, we should be focusing on a targeted package that directly addresses our nation's number one need while relief from the stimulus package passed in December continues to be distributed.

I urge the Biden Administration and my fellow colleagues in Congress to work together and immediately pass this targeted, bipartisan package without any extra add-ons so that we can prioritize the health of the American people, defeat this virus, get our kids back in school, and safely reignite our economy.

Learn more about our plan here. 

Supporting Drug-Free Communities Coalitions during COVID-19


While we continue to administer COVID-19 vaccinations and rein in the pandemic, we cannot turn a blind eye to the ongoing crisis caused by addiction and substance use disorder. That's why, this week, I introduced H.R. 654, the Drug-Free Communities Pandemic Relief Act, alongside my friend and colleague on the other side of the aisle Rep. Derek Kilmer (WA-06). 

Our bill would provide flexibility to Drug-Free Communities (DFC) coalitions during the COVID-19 pandemic by temporarily allowing the Office of National Drug Control Policy the authority to waive the program’s local matching requirements if the grantee is unable to meet them due to the ongoing pandemic. To put it plainly, this bipartisan legislation would give the DFC program the flexibility it needs to continue its life-saving work during these difficult times.
￼

The DFC program, which was created by legislation authored by then-U.S. Rep. Rob Portman in 1997, is a proven, evidence-based, and community-oriented program that has helped us combat the opioid crisis at the local level and has made a tremendous difference in the lives of countless young Ohioans. No other drug prevention program has achieved the same reduction in youth drug use that the DFC program has consistently achieved.

﻿I urge the House to act quickly on this bill so that we can ensure youth addiction prevention programs have the resources to conduct effective outreach in our communities during the ongoing pandemic.

Stepping Up to Better Serve Our Nation's Veterans

While there has been significant progress in reducing veteran homelessness over the last decade, it’s estimated that on any given night, nearly 40,000 veterans across the country are sleeping on the streets, in shelters, or in tents and stairwells. That's simply unacceptable. We cannot allow the brave men and women who have so selflessly served our country to slip through the cracks. 

That's why I joined my colleagues Anthony Gonzalez (OH-16) and Kathleen Rice (NY-04) in introducing the bipartisan Improving Housing Incomes for Veterans Act. This bill, which has the support of the American Legion, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and The Fleet Reserve Association, will help local service providers collaborate more effectively with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and streamline the processes necessary to help house America’s veterans and increase their access to affordable housing. 

Since being introduced, our bipartisan, commonsense bill has been referred to the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. I'm hopeful that it will soon progress out of the committee and receive a vote on the House floor. 

A Fun Snow Day on the National Mall

While we didn't get hit quite as hard as Ohio, Washington got some decent snow this past week. And that made a certain Golden Retriever very happy. 
￼

Thinking about our fun snow day on the National Mall is distracting me from the fact that the Browns didn't make it to the Super Bowl. Here's to hoping you have an uplifting memory from this week that does the same for you!

God bless and stay well,

Dave

2/7/21 13:55,An Update from Congressman David Kustoff,"
￼
￼

Dear Friends,

This week in Washington, I introduced an important piece of legislation that will place maximum pressure on Iran and its leaders to help expose the corrupt nature of Iran’s dangerous regime. Learn more here. In addition, House and Senate Democrats are trying to speed President Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID-19 plan through both chambers, even though we just passed a COVID relief package just one month ago. We do not need to pass another costly bill until all previous funds are used. Catch up more on my week by clicking here or the photo below.

The historic decision to move the United States embassy in Israel to Jerusalem sent a powerful message to the world that the U.S. officially recognizes Jerusalem as the unequivocal capital of Israel. This week, I urged Secretary Blinken to stand by our great ally and friend, Israel, and keep the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem.
￼
￼

This Saturday, on his birthday, we remembered the legacy of President Ronald Reagan. We honor his leadership, courage, and may his conservative legacy continue to inspire us all.

Americans Are Sick of the Left's Double Standard
Americans are tired of the Left’s double standard. Justice isn't a one-way street.

I joined Wake Up America to discuss why I introduced an amendment to hold Rep. Omar accountable for her dangerous and anti-American comments, Impeachment 2.0, Biden's attack on energy, and more!

The Democrat's Hypocrisy Is Staggering
For literally centuries, the majority in the House – whether that be Republican or Democrat – has always allowed the minority to choose from their ranks who will sit on as many committee seats as they are allotted for that Congress. That tradition was shattered this week by Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her allies.

The show trial this week to remove Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committee assignments was a disgrace. Rep. Greene was punished on an almost totally party-line vote for speeches and statements she made before she was elected to Congress. Meanwhile, similar consequences for other Democrat members who have made violent, threatening, and dangerous speeches after they were already in office were not even discussed by Nancy Pelosi and her Democrats.

I was proud to lead the effort in the House to try and correct this unfair and unjust situation by addressing the conduct of members, like Rep. Ilhan Omar, who have been spewing anti-Semitic, anti-American rhetoric throughout their time in office. Although House Democrats refused to act, I will keep fighting back against the hypocrisy and double standard we saw this week.

Democrats Push to Bail Out Failed Blue States
 There's more than $1 trillion sitting unused from previous COVID-19/stimulus bills yet Democrats are pushing to pass another $1.9 trillion package?

I support targeted spending to help Americans still hurting from the pandemic but sending a blank check to bail out failed Democrat states like California and New York is unacceptable.

Holding Communist China Accountable Must Be a Priority

Biden Continues to Kill U.S. Jobs
He really should be called “Joe the Job Killer"".

Raising the minimum wage to $15 will seriously hurt our economy and small businesses and could kill up to 3.7 million jobs.

 Biden Attempted to Give COVID-19 Vaccines to Guantanamo Bay Prisoners
 While you wait for a COVID-19 vaccine, Biden made plans for Gitmo detainees to get it first!

Democrats Have No Regard for the Growing National Debt
Democrats are rushing to shove a $1.9 trillion bill through Congress, without any GOP input, even though less than 20% of the last relief bill has been spent. Why?

The Democrats don’t care and have no regard for our $27 trillion national debt.

Reacting to Biden's Dangerous Border Policies
In just over two weeks, Biden has successfully made our borders less secure and us less safe.

As we continue to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, you’d think it’d be an obvious and easy decision to make sure our borders remain safeguarded – apparently not.

“Incitement” Is the Left's New Facade
“Incitement” is the new facade Democrats are hiding behind so they can justify another fake impeachment.

The real motive for Impeachment 2.0 is the same as last time: Democrats hate Trump and will do ANYTHING to destroy him. Their lack of constitutional authority to do this is irrelevant.

Latest News
Joining the Veteran Affairs Committee
￼
The House
 Republican Steering Committee has announced I will serve on the House
 Veterans’ Affairs Committee during the 117th Congress. The Third
 Congressional District of North Carolina contains the sixth most veterans
 of any congressional district in the U.S. 
It’s an
 honor to represent the 89,000 veterans who live in the Third District on
 the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee. Our veterans have
 selflessly served our great nation and deserve the benefits that their
 service has earned them. So I am especially thrilled to have another avenue
 to regularly advocate for the veterans in eastern North Carolina as
 well as the nation at large who have given so much for our
 country.

Opposing Budget Reconciliation
On Wednesday, the House passed H. Con. Res. 11, the FY2021 Budget Reconciliation Resolution, which began the budget reconciliation process. Budget reconciliation is a legislative procedure which can circumvent the 60-vote threshold needed to pass legislation in the Senate. It can only be used for fiscal policy matters and is typically reserved for partisan issues. Democrats intend to use budget reconciliation to attempt to pass a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package. I opposed it when it came to the floor for a vote. 
Joe Biden’s White House meeting with Senate Republicans the other day was obviously just a publicity stunt to give the impression of unity while continuing to ram through his radical, progressive agenda. Not a single portion of his proposed bill was changed after that meeting. He and Congressional Democrats have no intention to work with Republicans.
Further, if Joe Biden actually wanted this legislation to be bipartisan, then he wouldn’t have included a far-left non-starter $15/hour minimum wage hike. We should be looking to create more jobs, not get rid of them. More than doubling the minimum wage would destroy 1.3 million jobs according to the CBO, which is the last thing our economy needs right now.
After failing to codify their radical ungermane partisan riders in COVID-19 legislation during the last Congress, Democrats are continuing to use the same playbook in this Congress. I will fight against it during this term just as I did in the last.

Urging President Biden not to re-enter the Iran Nuclear Deal
￼
This past week, I led 51 other House Republicans in sending a letter to President Joe Biden urging him not to re-enter the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), commonly known as the Iran Nuclear Deal. Originally adopted during the Obama Administration in 2015, President Trump withdrew the United States from the JCPOA in 2018. During his presidential campaign, Biden indicated he would rejoin the agreement.
Not only was the Iran Nuclear Deal a failure to begin with, the facts on the ground have dramatically changed since it was signed and subsequently pulled out of by the Trump Administration. The max-pressure campaign used by President Trump has worked. Iran’s economy is crippled, their people are protesting more boldly than they have in 50 years, their top general has been taken out, and the power balance has shifted in the Middle East as more and more countries have begun normalizing ties with Israel. These are all major developments for the better for ours and Israel’s national security.
If President Biden decides to make any new agreement with Iran, then it must be contingent on Iran ending their explicit state sponsorship of terrorism. The United States cannot under any circumstances indirectly fund the killing of American soldiers and innocent people as we did under the JCPOA.
I thank my many colleagues who joined me in this effort. Together, we will fight tooth and nail against appeasing the terrorist Iranian regime.

Preventing terrorists from getting vaccines before American citizens
Last Monday, I became an original co-sponsor on a resolution opposing the Department of Defense's plan to vaccinate inmates at Guantanamo Bay against COVID-19 before more at risk American residents are vaccinated. The resolution opposes vaccinating these prisoners before American citizens and asserts American citizens should be prioritized in the vaccination process.
The fact that the Biden Administration was even thinking about providing COVID-19 vaccinations to known terrorists before American citizens is simply beyond comprehension. I fully support protecting our American soldiers and getting them vaccinated. But why on earth would we divert our resources from the elderly and minority populations in this country in favor of terrorists and enemy combatants? Placing the health of our own citizens over terrorists should not be a partisan issue. The temporary ""pause"" the Pentagon has put on these plans should immediately be made permanent. I’m proud to join my colleagues in formally denouncing this outrage.

Celebrating Black History Month
￼
Black History Month is a time during which we reflect on the many trials and tribulations Black Americans have faced in America, as well as the many contributions Black Americans have made to our country. America has had an imperfect history in the treatment of African Americans. Against such difficult odds great Americans such as Frederick Douglass, Martin Luther King, Jr., Maya Angelou and many others broke racial barriers to accomplish such wonderful things. America has been challenged to live up to the promises of freedom and equality outlined in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution.
Although more progress still awaits us, it's important to acknowledge that we have come a long way. So in this month, especially during this time of extreme division in our country, we should all remember that we should judge people by the content of their character rather than the color of their skin. Our external characteristics have no connection to our heart and our will. Our internal powers are the ones that prevail.

Addressing the vaccine roll out and Rachel Maddow's comments on Varney & Co. 
￼
I joined Fox Business this morning to talk about the outrageous claims made by uberliberal talk show host Rachel Maddow. Without a doubt the rioters who broke into the Capitol on January 6 committed criminal acts and should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. But for her to state that the Republican Party is the party of anarchy is laughable and ridiculous. Where was she and the rest of her riot-promoting Democrats when their radical supporters were burning down cities and businesses all summer long?
Republicans had the courage to condemn BOTH instances of violence. Democrats only condemned violence when it was politically convenient for them, and as a result, hundreds of business owners had their stores looted, destroyed and burned to the ground. 

 
Defending the Hyde Amendment and taxpayer priorities
￼
On the 26th, I joined Republican Study Committee Chairman Congressman Jim Banks and nearly 200 of my colleagues in sending a letter to Congressional leadership demanding that the Hyde Amendment remain in place. Taxpayer funds should NEVER be used to fund abortion. I was given an A+ Rating by the Susan B. Anthony List for a reason. I will vigorously oppose any government funding bill that repeals this longstanding and bipartisan provision.
Calling attention to the Chinese stealing Americans' DNA
￼
 
After hearing disturbing reports about Chinese efforts to purchase and steal Americans' DNA, I made a speech on the House floor last week to raise awareness about this alarming new development. Please take a minute to watch the speech above to learn more about this pernicious Chinese practice.

A+ rating from the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List
￼
Proud to receive an A+ grade from the Susan B. Anthony list for my voting record on pro-life issues in the 116th Congress! As a physician who has held 20-week old babies in my hand, it still floors me to think that some do not feel they are worthy of life. Honestly beyond my comprehension. I will continue to fight for the unborn, who are most vulnerable among us, while serving the people of eastern North Carolina in the 117th Congress.

District Work
Holding Suddenlink accountable
I had a very frank but productive conversation with Suddenlink’s executives last Tuesday afternoon. After expressing my many concerns with the inadequate service they have been providing their customers, they acknowledged the many shortcomings they have been trying to work through during the pandemic. Suddenlink officials made verbal assurances they would improve through a myriad of actions. 
We specifically discussed issues occurring in Craven County, where service has been particularly lacking. I will be following up with local elected officials in Craven County in the coming days to talk about the issue with them and monitor the situation in the coming months to determine whether it has improved. While I received assurances of improved internet and customer service in the months ahead, I expressed that the conversation will not end with this phone call. A follow up meeting between Suddenlink, myself and my staff has been scheduled for early March to monitor their commitments. I do believe they are committed to providing reliable service to our region, but I will be persistent in making sure it happens.

Volunteering at the Vidant vaccination clinic
￼
When it opened on the 25th, I spent a great morning with Sylvia and Tracy at the Vidant sponsored mass vaccination clinic at the Convention Center Greenville. They did an excellent job in through put and efficiency. Excellent. Around 1100 were vaccinated that day alone. Fortunately Vidant was able to secure its allotment of product from the state while some areas in the state were not as lucky. They have done a tremendous job during this entire pandemic of taking care of the people of eastern NC. We are nowhere near out of this pandemic but today was a tremendous leap forward. We must remember that the vaccine was only approved a month ago and Health care workers and long term care patients went first. Now 65 and older are being offered. Vaccines are being made as quickly as possible but it will probably be at least the end of March to get the number of units made to get folks their first dose. So please be patient. People are trying as hard as they can. There is light at the end of the tunnel.

Constituent Spotlight
Happy Birthday, Gilbert Carl Mays!
￼
Thank you to my friend, Representative David Rogers, who represents Burke and Rutherford Counties in District 112 of the State House, for presenting Gilbert Carl Mays a flag I had flown over the Capitol in his honor and an Extension of Remarks entered into the Congressional Record. Mr. Mays, a Beaufort County native and veteran who flew torpedo missions from the U.S.S. Yorktown, recently turned 100. Mr. Mays is one of the many dedicated American veterans who have fought so valiantly for our freedom. We should stop and thank them every chance we get.

Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 2.7.21
Sunday, February 7, 2021 –                                 
Encouragement at the National Prayer Breakfast
On February 4, I attended this year’s National Prayer Breakfast.
As with many other events, the coronavirus pandemic changed how the breakfast this year took place. Instead of gathering at the usual location, a hotel in Washington, D.C., with attendance numbering as great as 5,000 people, I joined other masked Members of Congress, from both parties and both the House of Representatives and the Senate, in the spacious auditorium of the Capitol Visitor Center to watch the events of the breakfast virtually.
It was disappointing this year not to be able to have more guests join us. From Virginia’s Ninth Congressional District, Bobby Griffin of Bristol often attends. I was sorry not to be able to see him this year. I spoke to him after the event, and he asked for the website link to the event. I have included it at the end of this column if any readers are interested themselves.
Despite this year’s changes, I appreciated the remarks, conversations, and musical performances that made up this year’s National Prayer Breakfast.
Presidential attendance and addresses have been a highlight of the event for decades. The first event in 1953 was organized by Rev. Billy Graham among others, and he helped convince President Dwight D. Eisenhower to attend. This year’s event included clips from prayer breakfast speeches of each president since Ronald Reagan.
The words of George W. Bush’s 2001 address to the breakfast nicely capture the importance of the event:
Faith is also important to the civility of our country. It teaches us not merely to tolerate one another, but to respect one another -- to show a regard for different views and the courtesy to listen. This is essential to democracy.
Several of the living former presidents offered a new message for this year. Bill Clinton spoke of how he looked forward to the National Prayer Breakfast each year of his presidency and came away from each one with a renewed sense of purpose, humility, and hope to build unity. Jimmy Carter sent a letter saying that it is too tempting to focus on what divides us instead of unites us, and that now is the time to bind up the nation’s wounds.
The keynote speaker for this year’s event was Andrew Young, a man who has led a historic life. As a civil rights activist, he was often by the side of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., including on the evening of April 4, 1968, when Dr. King was assassinated in Memphis. In fact, as he spoke at the prayer breakfast, his virtual background was the King Memorial in Washington. He went on to become a U.S. Representative from Georgia, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, and the Mayor of Atlanta.
Ambassador Young described arriving in Washington after he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1972. One of the first people he met was Doug Coe, an evangelist, who gave him a Bible and invited him to the weekly prayer breakfast of House members. He still has that Bible and held it up several times during his talk.
At the breakfast, he said, together they talked honestly and found trust and love through the faith they shared. The breakfast taught him to appreciate differences but also created unity. He said that we are in that kind of moment now.
Ambassador Young cited the title of a book by South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, No Future Without Forgiveness. He urged us to move forward in the spirit of those words today. Forgiveness is the pathway to unity, and it should be shared widely.
The message of Ambassador Young was a powerful one, and I think it deserves the consideration of all who heard his words at the breakfast.
I have enjoyed the National Prayer Breakfast each year I have attended, but at a time of division and anxiety such as this, I found its message and its meaning especially powerful. If you are interested in viewing the program, you can do so by visiting https://2021nationalprayerbreakfast.org/.

Congressman McHenry Weekly Update 

We Need To Safely Reopen America
 
There are hardworking Americans who are still hurting from the impact of the coronavirus crisis. We need to make sure that any additional funding will have an impact on those most in need. Support must be temporary, targeted, and tied to the coronavirus pandemic.There is no amount of stimulus that can replace open businesses, available jobs, and kids in classrooms. It is time to safely reopen our economy and let America get back to work.

￼

The coronavirus pandemic has had an unprecedented impact on our students’ ability to learn and acquire the tools they need for success. Yet, despite the CDC’s announcement that it is safe for schools to reopen and parents calling for their children to return to the classroom, President Biden is still taking orders from the teachers’ unions. We need to reopen our nation’s schools safely so students can get back to learning.

￼


President Biden Is Fulfilling Far-Left Campaign Promises
 
Despite his calls for unity, President Biden has moved to undo many of the economic and diplomatic wins from the past four years. He has already signed 42 executive orders in the last two weeks alone. Instead of bringing the country together, President Biden is choosing to fulfill far-left campaign promises that will destroy jobs and hurt the American people.

￼



The Right to Test Act
 
Widespread and readily available testing is a crucial tool in battling any future pandemic. As the current health crisis has shown, the American people cannot afford delays. On Wednesday, Senator Ted Cruz and I introduced the Right to Test Act, which will empower states to reduce testing delays and more rapidly respond to the evolving health needs of their communities as they work to curb the spread of COVID-19 or other future health threats.

Rob’s Rundown: Week of February 1 – February 5, 2021 
This week, Senator Portman worked to try and bring both parties together around another bipartisan COVID relief package.  He started the week on Sunday by joining Dana Bash on CNN’s State of the Union to discuss the importance of the Biden Administration working on a bipartisan basis with Congress to pass targeted COVID-19 relief. He also discussed the need to hold all members of Congress accountable for violent rhetoric.
On Monday, Portman and nine of his Republican colleagues unveiled their $618 billion COVID-19 relief proposal, which matches the Biden plan’s funding for the essential health care response to COVID-19, but takes a more targeted approach to the economic crisis by getting needed relief to the individuals, families, and small businesses that need it the most. That evening, the 10 lawmakers met with President Biden and Vice President Harris in the Oval Office to discuss their targeted relief proposal and urge bipartisan negotiation on any future COVID-19 legislation.  
On Tuesday, Portman delivered remarks on the Senate floor calling on the Biden Administration and Congressional Democrats to work with Republicans on the next COVID-19 relief package. Portman noted that all five previous COVID-19 rescue packages were negotiated and passed through Congress on a bipartisan basis. He expressed concern that using a process known as reconciliation to move this new bill through the Senate by a simple majority and with no Republican support would run counter to President Biden’s stated goal of uniting the country.
Finally, the Senate voted unanimously Thursday night to approve Portman’s amendment to the budget resolution to support vaccine administration and fund a science-driven public advocacy campaign promoting the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines.
For a more detailed look at Senator Portman’s week, please see the following:

Portman Joins Group of 10 Republican Senators in Outlining Targeted COVID-19 Relief Proposal, Request Meeting with President Biden 
Portman joined a group of 10 Republican Senators in writing to President Biden to propose a targeted COVID-19 relief proposal that they believe is capable of garnering bipartisan support. The group also requested a meeting with the President to discuss the proposal in detail.  
The letter’s signatories also include Senators Susan Collins (R-ME), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Todd Young (R-IN), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Mike Rounds (R-SD), and Thom Tillis (R-NC).  
""In the spirit of bipartisanship and unity, we have developed a COVID-19 relief framework that builds on prior COVID assistance laws, all of which passed with bipartisan support,"" the Senators wrote to the President. “Our proposal reflects many of your stated priorities, and with your support, we believe that this plan could be approved quickly by Congress with bipartisan support.  We request the opportunity to meet with you to discuss our proposal in greater detail and how we can work together to meet the needs of the American people during this persistent pandemic.""  
The Senators plan to unveil the details of their proposal on Monday, February 1.  Full text of the letter can be found here.

Portman, Brown Honor Judge Dan Polster as He Elects to Take Senior Status
Senators Portman and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) congratulated Judge Dan Polster, U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, as he elects to take senior status. First nominated by President Clinton in 1997, Polster oversaw several cases involving the ongoing addiction crisis in Ohio, specifically cases involving local communities hit hard by opioid addiction and seeking to hold certain opioid manufacturers and distributors financially accountable for their roles in the addiction crisis facing the state. Polster also served as a trial attorney in the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice from 1976 to 1982, and an Assistant United States Attorney in the Northern District of Ohio from 1982 to 1998. 
""Judge Polster has served the Northern District of Ohio with distinction during his 16 years with the US Attorney’s office and his 22 years of service on the federal bench,” said Portman. ""I’m grateful for his willingness to serve our country, and I know he will continue to be a leader for Northern Ohio in the years ahead."" 
Portman, Brown Honor Judge James Gwin as He Elects to Take Senior Status 
Senators Portman and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) congratulated Judge James Gwin, U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio, as he elects to take senior status. Prior to joining the federal bench, Judge Gwin served as a Judge on the Stark County Common Pleas Court. 
""Judge Gwin has served the Northern District of Ohio with distinction,” said Portman. “I’m grateful for his willingness to serve our country, and I know he will continue to be a leader for Northern Ohio in the years ahead.""

Portman Joins Group of 10 Republican Senators to Announce Sixth Targeted COVID-19 Relief Proposal 
Portman joined the group of 10 Republican Senators in unveiling the details of their targeted COVID-19 relief proposal.  At the President’s invitation, the group will meet with President Biden this afternoon at the White House to discuss the proposal in further detail.  
""Mr. President, we recognize your calls for unity and want to work in good faith with your Administration to meet the health, economic, and societal challenges of the COVID-19 crisis,” said the Senators.  ""We share many of your priorities, and our plan includes: increasing funding for the production and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine; providing economic relief for Americans with the greatest need; extending enhanced federal unemployment benefits; providing nutrition assistance to help struggling families; providing additional assistance for our small businesses; getting our children safely back to school and ensuring they can stay open; and increasing resources for child care, which is critical to getting Americans back to work.  We look forward to discussing our proposal in detail with you this afternoon at the White House."" 
Portman Joins Group of 10 Statement on Meeting with President Biden 
Following their more than two-hour meeting with President Biden and Vice President Harris to discuss their targeted COVID-19 relief proposal, the group of 10 Republican senators released this statement: 
""It was an excellent meeting, and we are very appreciative that in his first official meeting in the Oval Office, President Biden chose to spend so much time with us discussing the response to the COVID-19 crisis. We presented our proposal to the President, and we had a very productive exchange of views,” said the senators.  “On five previous occasions, Congress has demonstrated that we can come together to deliver COVID-19 relief for the American people.  In the coming days, talks among our group, the Biden Administration, and other Senators will continue as we work in good faith on a sixth bipartisan package to help struggling families, get students back to school, assist our small businesses and their employees, provide relief for health care providers, and accelerate testing and vaccine programs.""

Portman, Fischer, Lankford Introduce Bill to Reduce Regulatory Burden to Give Job Creators Freedom to Invest & Hire New Workers 
Senators Portman, Deb Fischer (R-NE), and James Lankford (R-OK) introduced the Unfunded Mandates Accountability and Transparency Act (UMATA). The bill will reduce excessive unfunded government mandates on job creators, giving them greater freedom to invest in their companies and hire new workers. When the federal government imposes unnecessary and burdensome regulations, it undermines employers’ ability to hire more workers, and makes it harder for American workers to find jobs. This legislation will free employers from stifling government mandates and help them create more jobs and compete globally. Representatives Virginia Foxx (R-NC) and Henry Cuellar (D-TX) are leading companion legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
""I have been proud to work to reduce the burden of unfunded mandates from the federal government on our society since 1995, when I sponsored the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act in the House. As we continue to face the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, reducing the regulatory burden on our employers is more important than ever, which is why I’m pleased to introduce the Unfunded Mandates Accountability and Transparency Act to do just that,” said Portman. “This bill engages the public in finding creative, effective solutions that impose fewer burdens on state, local, and Tribal governments, as well as the private sector. More effective, efficient regulations will allow employers invest more in their companies, bolster our economic recovery, and help get Americans back to work. I urge my colleagues to join Senators Fischer, Lankford and me in supporting in this bill.""  
Portman, Bipartisan Colleagues Urge Biden Administration to Address Global Semiconductor Shortage, Mitigate Impacts to U.S. Auto Manufacturing 
Senator and Senate Auto Caucus co-chair Portman and Senators Sherrod Brown (D-OH), co-chair of the Senate Auto Caucus, John Cornyn (R-TX), Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Gary Peters (D-MI), Todd Young (R-IN), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Mike Braun (R-IN), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), Dick Durbin (D-IL),Tim Scott (R-SC), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), and Lindsey Graham (R-SC) sent a letter to Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese urging him to work with Congress in addressing the global semiconductor shortage facing auto manufacturing.    
""We write to express our concerns about the impact that the global shortage of automotive-grade semiconductor chips will have on auto manufacturing in the United States. This shortage threatens our post-pandemic economic recovery, the consequences of which stand to be especially acute in dominant auto manufacturing states like ours. We believe that the incoming administration can continue to play a helpful role in alleviating the worst impacts of the shortage on American workers, and we urge you to work with us to address the global semiconductor shortage,"" the senators wrote. ""All sectors of the economy need access to semiconductor chips, however we ask that the auto industry be recognized as the significant semiconductor consumer it is in any engagement. We also strongly urge you to support efforts to secure the necessary funding to swiftly implement the semiconductor-related provisions in the most recent National Defense Authorization Act, which would boost the production of semiconductor manufacturing and incent the domestic production of semiconductors in the future.  While this is not an immediate fix, this engagement is also vital to maintain the competitive advantage of American auto manufacturing.""

On Senate Floor, Portman Calls for Good Faith Bipartisan Negotiations on Next COVID-19 Relief Package 
On the Senate floor, Portman discussed how the Biden Administration needs to work with bipartisan members of Congress on the next COVID-19 relief package. As a member of the bipartisan group that wrote the framework for the last $900 billion COVID-19 relief package, Portman believes the Biden administration is taking the wrong approach with its new $1.9 trillion COVID-19 proposal, which was created with no input from Republicans. In contrast, all five previous COVID-19 rescue packages were negotiated and passed through Congress on a bipartisan basis. He expressed concern that using a process known as reconciliation to move this new bill through the Senate by a simple majority and with no Republican support would run counter to President Biden’s stated goal of uniting the country. 
Portman also highlighted the $618 billion proposal he unveiled Sunday along with nine other Senate Republicans, which matches the Biden plan’s funding for the essential health care response to COVID-19, but takes a more targeted approach to the economic crisis by getting needed relief to the individuals, families, and small businesses that need it the most. 
Finally, Portman expressed his appreciation for the two-hour meeting he and the other nine Republican senators had with President Biden and Vice President Harris at the White House yesterday to discuss their targeted COVID-19 relief proposal, and stated his hope that the Biden Administration will continue to pursue a bipartisan approach to COVID-19 relief.

Portman Praises $1.1 Million Federal Grant Awarded to the Miami Conservancy District 
Portman praised the $1.1 million federal grant awarded by the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Economic Development Administration (EDA) to the Miami Conservancy District, Dayton, Ohio, to protect the Old North Dayton area from flooding by upgrading the Greater Old North Dayton levee. This EDA grant, to be matched with $276,254 in local investment, is expected to retain 100 jobs and generate $5 million in private investment. 
""This is great news for the Dayton region. I’m excited that the Conservancy, along with local investment, will be able to use these funds to protect the Old North Dayton area from flooding by upgrading the deteriorated concrete that armors the Greater Old North Dayton levee,"" said Portman. “In doing so, lives, properties, jobs, and businesses will be safeguarded and protected."" 
Portman Praises GM’s $75 Million Investment in Toledo Transmission Plant 
Portman praised GM’s announcement today that it will invest $75 million in the company’s Toledo Powertrain Plant. According to GM, the investment will increase the plant’s capacity to build 10-speed automatic transmissions that are used in GM’s award-winning full-size truck products including the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra. 
""This is terrific news for Toledo and Northwest Ohio and is a testament to the tremendous work ethic of the people of Ohio,"" said Portman. “I thank GM for their continued investment in our state and specifically Toledo. This investment will continue to help bolster the region’s economy while maintaining manufacturing jobs in Ohio."" 
Portman, as Part of Group of 10, Responds to Administration’s COVID-19 Relief Proposal 
Following their more than two-hour meeting with President Biden and Vice President Harris at the White House on Monday, the group of 10 Republican Senators sent a letter to President Biden responding to information shared by the President’s staff on the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan.  U.S. Senators Rob Portman (R-OH), Susan Collins (R-ME), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), Mitt Romney (R-UT), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), Todd Young (R-IN), Jerry Moran (R-KS), Mike Rounds (R-SD), and Thom Tillis (R-NC), who unveiled their COVID-19 relief compromise on Monday, provided feedback on the Administration’s proposal and identified both areas of agreement and needs that should be met through a more targeted approach.  
""We appreciated your meeting with us on Monday to discuss how we can unite to pass a sixth bipartisan COVID-19 relief package to combat this persistent pandemic.  To date, Congress has provided more than $4 trillion to address the urgent health, societal, and economic consequences of the pandemic, including $900 billion that was signed into law just five weeks ago,” the senators wrote.  ""We have received some information and data from your office on your request for $1.9 trillion for your American Rescue Plan, and we look forward to receiving additional information on your small business and tax proposals.  In the spirit of continuing to have an open and productive dialogue, we want to provide feedback on the documents we received to date.  We remain committed to working in a bipartisan fashion and hope that you will take into account our views as the legislative process moves forward.""  
 ""Thank you for your consideration of our analysis and views,” the senators continued.  “We look forward to receiving additional details on your $1.9 trillion request and to a further discussion of how best to assist the American people during this difficult time.""

Senate Unanimously Passes Portman-Cardin Budget Resolution Amendment to Fund COVID-19 Vaccine Public Awareness Campaign 
The U.S. Senate approved an amendment offered by Senators Portman and Ben Cardin (D-MD) to the budget resolution to support vaccine administration and a public awareness campaign. The amendment passed unanimously after Portman delivered remarks in support of the amendment. The Senate continues to consider amendments to the Budget Resolution. 
Senators Portman and Cardin introduced bipartisan legislation in December of last year to fund a science-driven public advocacy campaign to ensure that when an effective COVID-19 vaccine has been authorized by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA), Americans are ready to get it. According to polling, just over half of Americans are willing to take a COVID-19 vaccine when it is authorized and made available to the public. This legislation would authorize necessary funding for a public awareness campaign on COVID-19 vaccine information through the Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Grants would go to entities to start developing campaigns that target all Americans, and that would begin no later than 30 days after a vaccine is authorized. 
A transcript of Senator Portman’s remarks can be found below and a video can be found here.

Senate Passes Portman Amendment to Ensure COVID-19 Spending Accountability & Transparency 
Last night, the Senate passed an amendment authored by Portman to the budget resolution to require the administration to make public and keep the country informed of how much money has been spent on relief from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""As we consider this $2 trillion stimulus request from the administration, it’s important for the American people to know how their tax dollars are being spent to combat this pandemic,"" said Portman. “This amendment will ensure Congress has the information it needs to direct tax dollars to areas with the biggest need. So far the CDC has only distributed $3 billion of the $8.75 billion appropriated for vaccine distribution, for example. Nearly $14 billion in previously appropriated funding for COVID-19 testing has still not been obligated. And according to the U.S. Department of Education, states have spent only $4.38 billion of the emergency $68 billion in K-12 funding provided last year. With greater transparency in this process, Congress can focus on ensuring the most urgent needs are met and this amendment will help us do just that."" 
Portman, Brown Announce More Than $35 Million for Mental Health Services, Community Behavioral Health Clinics in Ohio 
Senators Portman and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded $32.4 million in Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics (CCBHC-COVID) Expansion grants across Ohio. Ohio’s State Department of Mental Health and Addiction services also received $2.9 million to provide crisis intervention services, mental and substance use disorder treatment, and other related recovery supports for children and adults impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The funding expansion comes as part of a government funding measure Congress passed in December 2020.
""The social isolation and increased anxiety caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has only exacerbated many of the issues Ohioans face that can negatively impact mental health and substance use disorders,” said Portman. “I’m pleased that HHS has awarded more than $35 million in Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics Expansion grants across Ohio thanks to the bipartisan COVID-19 relief package Congress enacted in December, which was based on the framework I helped negotiate. This funding will help vulnerable individuals across Ohio gain access to the resources and care they need.""

Sen. Rob Portman hopes for coronavirus compromise with Biden administration 
On the morning after he and nine other Republican senators spent two hours discussing coronavirus relief with Democratic President Joe Biden, Ohio’s Sen. Rob Portman wasn’t sure whether they’d be able to whittle down Biden’s $1.9 trillion plan into something closer to the $618 billion that he and his fellow Republicans have proposed.
Speaking to reporters the morning after the Monday meeting that White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki described as “substantive and productive,” Portman said both sides want an almost identical amount of funding to address COVID-19, $160 billion, and both sides want $4 billion for behavioral health and addiction services.
But Portman argues that much of the extra stimulus money Biden wants isn’t necessary because organizations like the Congressional Budget Office predict that once the COVID 19 threat dissipates, the economy will recover to pre-pandemic levels by the middle of the year without further intervention. Noting that much of the $900 billion from the stimulus package signed into law on Dec. 27 hasn’t been spent yet, Portman says policymakers should examine whether the extra money is worth it at a time when the nation has the biggest budget deficit in history while its economy is improving and the vast majority of Americans are employed.
""My hope is that the administration will continue to not just meet with us but to work with us on a package that is a compromise between where Republicans are and where the administration is to get something done, as the President has said, but to do it in a targeted smart way, where we’re not wasting funds, where we’re focusing on the real problems,” said Portman.
Portman said 10 Republicans went to the White House to meet with Biden to show their party could deliver the 10 votes necessary to pass a bipartisan bill with 60 votes, instead of using a budget process called “reconciliation” that would let Democrats pass their own without any backing from Republicans. Biden told the group that he hopes his rescue plan can pass with bipartisan support, but views a reconciliation package as an option if that isn’t feasible.
Portman said Republicans believe that many of the provisions that Democrats have discussed including in the bill - like cybersecurity legislation and raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour - have nothing to do with the budget and aren’t appropriate to include in a reconciliation package.
""My strong view is that taking a partisan approach, which is what the administration was considering and may still be considering, would be a big mistake for the American people,” said Portman. “It’s going to be much tougher to get that relief enacted, but it’s also bad for the country right now. It would start the administration off on a partisan foot rather than following what the President said in his inaugural address, which is that he wants to work in a bipartisan manner to help heal the country.""
Portman said Republicans would like the next round of stimulus checks to go only to individuals who make $50,000 a year or less, and couples who make $100,000, because they need the money and are more likely to spend it than families who make up $300,000, the limit under the Biden plan. The GOP plan would also extend the federal government’s $300 per week unemployment insurance supplement until June 30, which Portman believes should suffice given projections “we’re going to be back to the economy we had before the pandemic by mid year.
""To go beyond that, to September, which is what the administration wants to do, doesn’t seem to meet the need right now,” Portman continued. 
￼ 
Portman’s retirement leaves void in addiction response 
When I heard the news Sen. Rob Portman would not seek reelection in 2022, I was personally relieved for him. I know he’s a good person, and I have seen firsthand how well he’s served our communities. He deserves a more peaceful life with his family and has earned it many times over. 
Portman’s decision not to run again, however, will leave a big hole in the nation response to drug addiction. The senator is a giant when it comes to addiction policy and response and leaves some very big shoes for his successor to fill. That void is concerning to me.
I have been in federal-level meetings where it has been said, “As Cincinnati, Hamilton County goes with drug supply and addiction response, so too goes the United States.” Anyone hoping to win Portman’s seat must make addiction issues a critical part of their platform and work. As the field of candidates for this coveted Senate seat emerges, voters should ask an important question: Who will carry the mantle of addiction as Sen. Portman has?
There has not been a stronger advocate on the issue than Portman. Because of his holistic and comprehensive understanding of addiction, he was able to see it from the first responder perspective – medics, police, nurses, doctors, treatment caregivers and even those with substance abuse disorder. His extensive knowledge shaped many of his policies. 
Cincinnati/Hamilton County was one of the first places in the U.S. where the deadly drug carfentanil hit the streets. Portman came to one of the area’s hardest hit fire stations in terms of overdoses. He sat with police and treatment professionals, not to give a speech, but to just listen. He met with other city and county leaders about this new deadly drug and helped to get equipment so analysts could detect the presence of carfentanil. 
Portman worked with the Drug Enforcement Administration and other federal agencies to identify how carfentanil was entering the country. The source turned out to be manufacturers and distributors in China who were smuggling the drug into the country through the U.S. Post Office. His partnership with local government agencies helped shape the STOP Act, a law giving the Post Office the ability to intervene in suspicious packages from these known drug manufacturing countries.
I walked alongside Sen. Portman as he toured a center for those with substance use disorder. When patients began speaking about how addiction had impacted them, Portman asked if it would be OK if he joined them. He went into a room with them alone, leaving the rest of us outside the door, as a show of respect for them and their stories. The personal accounts of those people would help to shape two piece of life-saving legislation, the Comprehensive Addiction & Recovery Act (CARA) and CARA 2.0, which provided millions of dollars for treatment, prevention and recovery programs.
I was profoundly humbled when he offered me, a small town police chief, a seat at the table in Washington D.C. to testify in the Senate Permanent Committee on Investigations that he chaired. I got to see firsthand how he worked across party lines to pass bipartisan addiction legislation and raise awareness about addiction to a national level. By giving me and others a voice and opening doors for us to advocate at the federal level, Sen. Portman empowered a movement. When I feel overwhelmed, I am inspired by the senator’s tireless work.
Portman can enter retirement knowing he has made a difference in the lives of the people he served. His legacy is cemented forever in the addiction policies he initiated, the lives he save, all those in recovery programs and the families who love them, and those the senator mentored, even if only by being in his presence.
So to those jockeying for his seat, you have a high bar to meet. Know that as addiction goes here in Greater Cincinnati, so too it goes for the rest of the country. Make those struggling with addiction and their loved ones a priority as Portman did. Understand that while rhetoric may score points on social media, compassionate actions and good policies last much longer than political careers.

Dear Neighbor,
 
February is Black History Month, a time to celebrate and honor the Black community, and highlight African Americans’ accomplishments of the past and innovations of today.
 
Throughout the month, I will be sharing stories and talking about  CA-44's African American leaders, organizers, and community members. How will you be celebrating Black History Month? Whether by reading books, sharing family stories, helping out your neighbor or buying from Black-owned businesses, please share your story or pictures here. (By submitting, you give consent for the content to potentially be used in my communications.)
  
￼
  
This has been a challenging time for many of us and these experiences have made it clear that everyone deserves to have access to the healthcare – including mental healthcare – that they need. In recognition of Black History Month, the Black Mental Health Task Force will be hosting a virtual fair and workshop on February 25th, 2021 at 10:30 am PST. You are  encouraged to call the LACDMH’s 24/7 Help Line to request mental health support, resources and referrals at (800) 854-7771 if you or someone you know needs support and services.
 
It's Super Bowl Sunday! It's on all of us to make sure today isn't a super spreader event. Stop the spread and watch the big game from home.
 
In this newsletter you will find COVID updates, community resources, and updates from DC. 
  
 
COVID-19 Vaccine Updates
 
Vaccine Update
 
We are aware that many constituents are having a hard time getting an appointment for the vaccine. If you have internet access, please check the site each morning because new appointments are added. Just yesterday same day appointments were added for the vaccine at Dodger Stadium.
 
Remember there is a limited supply and there are barriers that prevent many from getting an appointment such as lack of access to internet, transportation to a vaccine site or language barriers. Know that my office and I are doing all we can to make sure the vaccine is reaching the most vulnerable and hardest hit COVID-19 communities.
 
This week I wrote to President Biden and Governor Newsom asking them to make sure the distribution of vaccines is equitable and that they use creative ways to get vaccines in the right arms- the most vulnerable. For example, I am calling on the use of mobile units to go into communities to bring the vaccine directly to the people, make the vaccine available at more community health centers and pharmacies, plus provide an option for those who cannot fill out a form online or get an appointment online. Bottom line is we need more vaccination sites in and near our congressional district. I will not stop until we get this done -- it is a top priority.
 
 
Reminder: These L.A. county residents are currently eligible for the vaccine:
	•	Over 65 years old
	•	Healthcare workers
	•	Staff and residents at skilled nursing facilities
	•	Staff and residents at long-term facilities
	•	In home health services workers (IHHS) can register for the vaccine as a healthcare workers. Bring a paystub from IHHS and photo ID.
 
Visit VaccinateLAcounty.com to book an appointment – appointments are required. Residents with disabilities or without computer access can call 833-540-0473 between 8:00 am and 8:30 pm 7 days a week for assistance with appointments. 
 
If you live in Long Beach, educators, childcare workers, food or agricultural workers and government emergency responders now also qualify for the vaccine. Check the city website for an appointment and eligibility.
 
  
￼
￼
  
If you are having trouble navigating the appointment system, please contact my office at (310) 831-1799 and we will do our best to assist you.

Our COVID numbers in California are finally getting better. Southern California’s ICU capacity is now 11 percent, which is still concerning but showing signs of improvement. Hospitalizations and the rate of positive COVID tests are also going down. This good news means your efforts to stay home, wear a mask, and keep your distance are working. Keep it up! We still have to protect each other until everyone can get vaccinated which is going to take several months.

2/7/21 19:38,One Step Closer to COVID-19 Relief,"￼ 
Friends,   When insurrectionists stormed our nation’s Capitol on January 6, it was heroic members of the Capitol Police force who fought to hold them back and protect all of us inside. And on that day, Officer Brian Sicknick, a proud South River, NJ native, gave his life courageously defending our democracy. On Wednesday morning, I joined his family, friends and hundreds of fellow officers to pay my respects as he laid in honor in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. Brian was truly selfless, brave and dedicated his life to serving and protecting our nation.

￼
ONE: COVID-19 Relief
Early Friday morning, Democrats passed a budget resolution, an important step forward in delivering on President Biden’s American Rescue Plan. Our country is hurting and this big, bold relief plan is designed to meet the tremendous needs of the American people and rebuild our crippling economy. And we need to move quickly. We cannot afford to wait! The legislation will include a national vaccination program, direct payments to struggling families, funding for state and local governments to keep first responders, teachers, and public health workers on the job, and help for unemployed workers and ailing small businesses and restaurants in New Jersey. Please know I will not rest until this bill is on the President’s desk and help is on the way to you and your family. Read more about the budget resolution here. 
 
￼
TWO: Student Debt Relief
President Biden has the authority to cancel student loan debt and he should use that authority now! Millions of young people throughout New Jersey and the nation were drowning under the weight of student loan debt long before the coronavirus reached our shores. And it’s only gotten worse as the economic crisis is making it harder and harder to make ends meet. This week, Senator Booker and I cosponsored a Senate resolution calling on President Biden to use his executive authority to cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt. It’s the right thing to do for our families and the smart thing to do for our economy. Learn more here. 
 
￼
THREE: Chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
This week I officially became Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a role I do not take lightly after four years of failed leadership under the Trump Administration. We must rebuild demoralized institutions like the State Department, repair alliances around the world, and develop smarter strategies to compete with China, address Russian aggression, fight climate change, and counter ever-changing threats around the world. I pledge to you that as Chairman I will fight for American leadership abroad that reflects the values we hold dear at home, including democracy, freedom, human rights and the rule of law.
 
And one more thing!!  February is Black History Month, a time to celebrate and honor the contributions of Black Americans to our great nation. New Jersey and our communities are fortunate to have the leadership and inspiration of individuals such as Lieutenant Governor Sheila Oliver and Senator Cory Booker. 
Make sure to follow me on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook as I uplift the stories, voices and contributions of other Black New Jerseyans who have helped move our nation forward.   Sincerely,   ￼  Senator Bob Menendez

2/7/21 22:35,Weekly Wrap Up,"
￼ 
Dear Neighbor,
It was another eventful week, and I am glad to send you this update. 
I returned to Washington on Tuesday.  That evening, Capitol Police Officer Brian D. Sicknick returned to the United States Capitol to lie in honor.  Officer Sicknick was killed in the line of duty on January 6 as he defended the Capitol and those inside it.  As one of the people in the House of Representatives chamber that day, I know that his actions—and the actions of the Capitol Police officers present—saved our lives and protected our constitutional system.  I was grateful for the opportunity to pay my respects to Officer Sicknick as he lay in honor in the Capitol Rotunda.
￼

Yesterday marked 30 days since one of the darkest days in our country’s history.  The events of January 6 are very much with us in Washington: the Capitol is still being protected by the National Guard, new fencing surrounds it, and other new measures are in place to ensure safety.  Several investigations are in progress to perform a thorough review of all aspects of the insurrection—and it is vitally important that we understand and learn from what happened.  On Tuesday, the trial of former President Trump will begin in the Senate following his impeachment in the House.
At the same time Congress responds to these serious threats to our democracy, we are moving forward to address the threats families across the country face as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, including so many here in TX07.
￼
Responding to the coronavirus is the highest priority of the Congress.  This week, Congress took critical first steps to deliver on President Biden’s American Rescue Plan.  Congress plans to pass this legislation using the budget process and a budget process called reconciliation.  The House and the Senate both passed a budget resolution that will begin this process.  Next week, House Committees will be writing the legislation to deliver on this plan. 
The House Energy & Commerce Committee that I serve on will have an important role in crafting key parts of this legislation.  This week, we held two hearings on relevant issues.  Our Health Subcommittee hearing, “Road to Recovery: Ramping Up COVID-19 Vaccines, Testing, and Medical Supply Chain” focused on improving our national response to COVID-19, especially the increased and expedited delivery of vaccines, the disjointed patchwork of state testing plans, and supply chain constraints on essential medical supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE).  (You can watch my questions here).
Our Subcommittee on Consumer Protection and Commerce held our first hearing, “Safeguarding American Consumers: Fighting Scams and Fraud During the Pandemic.”  Since the beginning of the pandemic, Americans have reported losing more than $300 million in pandemic-related fraud, and we learned about the scams, fake products, and price-gouging, as well as ways to combat them.  
If you would like to learn more about the House Energy & Commerce Committee and keep up with our work, click here.
I introduced two bills this week.  I reintroduced the bipartisan Loan Interest Forgiveness for Taxpayers Under a Pandemic (LIFT UP) Act, which I also filed last Congress, to help small businesses obtain equitable access to debt forgiveness during the coronavirus pandemic while also rebuilding from storms like Harvey.  I was glad to introduce this bipartisan bill with Congressman Michael McCaul.
￼

I also introduced the Expand Medicaid Now Act, designed to increase the amount of federal funding for Medicaid expansion in an effort to encourage those states that have not expended their programs to do so.  Texas has the highest rate of uninsured people in the country.  It is vitally important for Texas to expand Medicaid now and ensure that families have access to affordable, quality health care as we continue to confront the coronavirus pandemic.
I also co-sponsored several bills this week, many of which I co-sponsored in the last Congress, including:
	•	The USPS Fairness Act, to end the United States Postal Service’s pre-funding mandate on future retiree health benefits, which will help the USPS address financial issues;
	•	The RESTAURANTS Act, to create a $120 billion restaurant revitalization fund;  
	•	The Big Cat Public Safety Act, to prohibit the private ownership of big cats like tigers, lions, leopards, and pumas and end the abusive cub petting industry;
	•	The Emmett Till Antilynching Act, to make lynching a federal crime that warrants an enhanced sentence under hate crimes statues;
	•	The Gun Violence Prevention Research Act, to authorize $50 million in funding each fiscal year for the next five years at the CDC to study gun violence; and
	•	The Scientific Integrity Act, to set clear, enforceable standards for federal agencies and federally funded research to keep public science independent from political or special interest meddling.
In addition to co-sponsoring bills, I also joined colleagues in sending several letters to the Biden administration and to House leadership, including:
	•	A letter to HHS Acting Secretary Becerra asking for demographic data on COVID-19 vaccinations;
	•	A letter to Governor Abbott asking the Governor to allow Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas to serve Medicaid insured patients during the pandemic;
	•	A letter led to President Biden urging the appointment of an Ambassador to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism; and
	•	A letter to Education Secretary-Designate Cardona urging the replacement of former Secretary Devos' final rule prescribing how K-12 schools and postsecondary institutions must respond to sexual harassment and assault under Title IX.
You can see all the bills I have cosponsored at Congress.gov (click here).  And you can view my full voting record on my website (click here).
￼

￼

I was proud to announce that our constituent services team—including Shirley, Claudia, and Spencer—has helped more than 3,500 families in our district get the help they need with federal agencies.  It is a privilege for me and for our district team to be able to provide real assistance to our neighbors, especially in these difficult times.
In my 2020 Annual Report, I reported that COVID-19-related casework represented more than 44 percent of all cases closed we closed in 2020, with residents seeking assistance with the Texas Workforce Commission, Small Business Administration, and the Internal Revenue Service. 
See stories from the constituents we have helped here—and if you need assistance with federal agencies, you can begin the process here or call my office at (713) 353-8680.  
￼
While Congress and the Biden Administration seek solutions and build strategies to shore up public health agencies, ramp up vaccines, and address the impacts COVID-19 has had on our economy and well-being as a country, it is critical that we all do our part to stay healthy and keep our loved ones safe.
As of Friday, there have been 326,248 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Houston/Harris County and 3,026 deaths and 279,184 patients have recovered.  The positivity rate is 17.3%, slightly lower than last week.  Some of the highest confirmed case rates in our region are in the Cy-Fair area.  COVID-19 variants have now begun to spread nationally, including here in Texas, and we are at a critical moment where vaccines could slow the rate of spread.  We also know that these variants are spreading quickly.  For these reasons, it is important to continue protecting yourself and others through the use of face coverings, social distancing, and hand washing and getting the vaccine when you are able to do so.
Harris County’s ReadyHarris website now has a portal where all residents are invited to sign up to get the vaccine.  Although still in the early stages of rollout, patients who sign up will be called when it is their turn to get the vaccine.  For the City of Houston’s vaccination efforts, you can register for notifications about new appointments by subscribing to the HoustonRecovers option at AlertHouston.  And for those who have received a first dose of the vaccine, do not forget to go back when it is time to get the required second dose in order for the vaccine to be fully effective.
￼

These are difficult times for our country.  I am honored and proud to be your representative to the Congress, and to do my part to ensure that we successfully address the many challenges before us.  As always, please do not hesitate to call on me and my team if there is anything we can do to help you or if there is anything you want me to know.  You can email here or call (713) 353-8680 or (202) 225-2571 at any time.
With best wishes,
￼

Estimados amigos:

Un nuevo año ha comenzado y con ello vienen nuevos retos, metas y proyectos que deseo encaminar para el bien de Puerto Rico. Quisiera agradecerle al pueblo de Puerto Rico por depositar su confianza en mí para, por segundo término consecutivo, servirles como su voz en la Capital federal.

Nuestro primer cuatrenio fue uno de emergencias: los huracanes, los terremotos y la pandemia del COVID-19 nos unieron más como pueblo y nos hicieron más resilientes.

Con la llegada del 2021 y el Congreso 117 estaré enfocada en trabajar por medidas de impacto en el desarrollo económico de la Isla, avanzar los temas de salud y abogar por la estadidad para todos los puertorriqueños.

Este primer mes hemos presentado varias piezas legislativas; ya nos hemos reunido con funcionarios estatales, federales y organizaciones; hemos anunciado varias asignaciones federales, he acompañado a servidores públicos en la juramentación de sus cargos, hemos comenzado a trabajar agendas con municipios, entre otros asuntos. En este boletín podrás encontrar algunas de nuestras gestiones.

Seguimos trabajando, para ustedes...

Are You Experiencing Postal Service Delays?
 
  
Lindsey,  I'm hearing from a lot of Northeastern Pennsylvanians who are telling me it's taking way too long for them to get their mail. This has gone on too long, and it's unacceptable because I know you're counting on the USPS to deliver prescription medication, COVID relief funds, tax documents, bills and other essentials on time. I serve on the House Appropriations subcommittee that funds the Postal Service, so if you're having trouble with your mail, I want to hear from you. Will you take a moment to take this short, three-question survey?
  
Take the Survey
  
Postal Service officials have told me that the delays were caused by a surge in election and holiday mail, but we're weeks past that now, and things don't seem to be getting any better. It may be time for us to make bigger management changes at USPS, but first, I want to hear from you. Will you please take this brief survey to tell me if mail delays are affecting you? Thanks. I'll be back in touch about this soon, Lindsey.

Be safe and well,

Weekly Wrap-Up with 
Congressman Byron Donalds
February 8, 2021
 
 
Last week, I witnessed firsthand why Congress has a terrible approval rating and why our body is labeled a ""do-nothing Congress."" During a pandemic, when millions of Americans are out of work and struggling to make ends meet, Democrat leadership spent most of the week engaging in partisan games non of which were aimed at benefiting the American people. While we were actually working, Speaker Pelosi brought a multi-trillion-dollar budget to the floor through the partisan process of reconciliation. Politicians in Washington can not continue to operate as if America's treasury dollar grows off trees. 
 
Navigating throughout Congress in the minority party will not be easy, but I did not come to Washington to sit on my hands. Every day I serve as your Congressman, I will not take for granted. While in session, I joined my fellow members on the Oversight and Reform and Small Business committees for our first committee meetings of the 177th Congress where we worked to find common-sense solutions to the problems facing the small business owners and the efficiency of our government. Also, I took part in my first speech on the House floor, where I called on members across the aisle to object to the budget reconciliation process that subverts half of America's voices. I also sent a letter to the United States Department of Homeland Security calling on Secretary Mayorkas and the Biden Administration to halt any plans to vaccinate illegal immigrants. Florida's 19th Congressional District is taking center stage in our nation's capital, and I am proud to represent all of you.
 

 
 
""Black History is America's History""
 
In honor of Black History Month, and in a call for unity, I penned an Op-Ed on the significance of Black History in America. The Op-Ed was featured in the Washington Examiner. You can read the Op-Ed in its entirety below:
 
""February marks the beginning of a historic time that recognizes black Americans' contributions to our nation's great story. While we dedicate this month as Black History Month, the black community's impact on America is appreciated and recognized endlessly.
 
As one of three black Republicans in Congress and the first black American to represent my district, my rise from inner-city Brooklyn to the halls of Congress is living proof of our great nation's promise. Although the founding of our constitutional republic did not live up to the words of our founding documents, we have progressed as a nation to honor these sacred words: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.""
 
America's storied history is woven together by the significant contributions of the black community. From the western shores of Africa to the shores of America, through the atrocity of slavery and the continued suppression during segregation and Jim Crow, our history, while at times very dark and tumultuous, represents the grit and resilience embodied by generations of black Americans.
 
We can celebrate Black History Month today because of the fortitude and fearless conviction of patriots such as Sojourner Truth, who risked her life to recruit black troops for the Union Army, and through the powerful words of W.E.B Du Bois. As black Americans continued to fight for their rights, it was the teachings and leadership of the ""First Lady of the Struggle,"" Mary McLeod Bethune, that educated and empowered countless black Americans.
 
While black athletes fought to play on a level playing field in professional sports, it was the perseverance of Jackie Robinson that made it a reality. When blacks faced unequal justice under the law for decades, it took the will of Associate Justice Clarence Thomas, a descendant of slaves, to rise and become only the second black man ever to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.
 
As a nation, we have come so far, but that does not mean our work is finished. As an elected official, I continue to strive to enhance and empower my community with policies that end generational poverty and bring forth actions that enable, spur, and encourage a pathway to the American Dream.
 
By prioritizing access to capital initiatives, criminal justice reform, school choice, standing up for life, encouraging fathers in the home, and economic freedom, the black community can and will reach its highest potential. During Black History Month, we pay homage to those who dedicated their lives to advancing the lives of black Americans and reaffirm our commitment to remaining the land of the free and the home of the brave.""
 
Byron Donalds represents Florida's 19th Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives.

 
 
Speech on the House Floor
 
 
On Wednesday, February 3rd, Congress convened to debate the COVID-19 budget resolution proposed by President Biden and Senate and House Democrat leaders. I was honored to give a speech on the floor of the United States House of Representatives for the first time. 
 
“This budget resolution is not about economics, and it’s not about COVID-19, it’s not about helping our schools reopen. This budget resolution is pure politics. It is an opportunity to push through an agenda through budget reconciliation,” Mr. Donalds criticized the fiscally irresponsible $2.1 trillion budget proposal, “If you want to help state and local governments take care of their revenue problems, they should open up.”

""Black GOP Lawmakers Call on National Museum of African American History to Honor 
Justice Clarence Thomas""
 
 
Being only one of three African-American Republicans currently serving in Congress, I was honored to join Senator Tim Scott and Congressman Burgess Owens in a letter to the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History to properly honor the life and legacy of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. 
 
""As a Black man who has a profound respect for the contributions Justice Thomas has propitiated for generations to come, this museum must encapsulate his life as it does for hundreds of other monumental Black figures,"" I wrote, stating that, the museum ""falls short"" of representing Justice Thomas' ""achievements and life compared to his counterpart, the Honorable Justice Thurgood Marshall.""
 
I would like to thank Kay C. James, Paris Dennard, Bruce Levell, Dr. Alveda King, and Marc Little in supporting this letter in this effort.

Legislative Updates
 
 
The Biden Administration has set a troubling standard as to who receives a COVID-19 vaccine. In the first few weeks of the Biden presidency, we have continuously seen the American people be put last. Because of this, last week I sent a letter to Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas calling on the Department any effort to prioritize vaccinating illegal migrant populations over the American people. Click here to read the letter: 
 
Congressman Donalds Pens Letter to Secretary of Homeland Security
 
 

 
As a new member of the House Committee on Government Oversight and Reform, am excited to join the Civil Rights and Civil Liberties & Economic and Consumer Policy subcommittees. A good government requires a commitment to expose waste, fraud, and abuse, and I will ensure Washington is working for you.
 

 
This global pandemic  has devastated countless families, along with our economy. The fiscally irresponsible budget measure of this magnitude proposed by the Biden Administration is detrimental to the nation's fiscal welfare & national security. 
 
On February 2nd, I sent a letter to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.

Governor DeSantis Announces $75 Million to Florida Communities for Future Storms
 
On February 3rd, Governor Ron DeSantis announced that $75 million has been award to 30 communities throughout Florida in partnership with the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity's Rebuild Florida Critical Facility Hardening Program. The program was created to increase the resiliency of essential facilities that serve a purpose of public safety for local communities.

	•	Lee County ($2,820,983) – harden several roofing systems, and secure the HVAC systems of Lee County’s Waste to Energy facility.

 
 
Serving the hardworking men and women of Florida's 19th Congressional District is my distinct honor and privilege. It's time Washington works for our community's values, and every day I will always strive to ensure your government is working for you. 
 
Sincerely,

2/8/21 9:43,Wicker Calls Out Biden’s Job-Killing Energy Decisions,"￼
Wicker Calls Out Biden’s Job-Killing Energy Decisions 
Cutting Energy Access Will Slow Economic Recovery 
It has been almost a full year since the coronavirus first disrupted our economy and changed daily life as we know it. In addition to the mounting death toll, millions of Americans have suffered job losses, and entire industries have been pushed to the brink. Federal relief has provided a critical short-term lift to many families and businesses, but Americans now need a full and sustainable recovery. I had hoped President Biden would make good on his pledge to work with Republicans and lower barriers for job creators. Unfortunately, his recent actions against the energy sector have shut the doors of opportunity for thousands of Americans at the worst possible time. 
Biden Targets Oil and Gas Workers 
President Biden’s early actions have taken a huge toll on American energy jobs. On his first day in office, the President revoked the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline, effectively ending a project that would have supported up to 11,000 jobs and boosted our national oil supply. Mr. Biden justified his decision by citing our current “climate crisis,” even though the pipeline would have minimal impact on the environment. Ironically, canceling the pipeline will likely lead to greater pollution because more Canadian oil will have to be transported by diesel-powered rail. 
The President continued his attack on American energy by ordering a pause on all new oil and natural gas leases from federal lands and waters. This means energy producers will not be able to obtain drilling rights in federally-controlled areas for the foreseeable future, creating uncertainty for our domestic energy supply. Our nation depends on these federal leases as a major source of energy and economic growth. In 2019, federal leases accounted for 22 percent of American oil and 12 percent of U.S. natural gas production, with much of this output coming from wells in the Gulf of Mexico. These offshore projects support 20,000 Mississippi jobs and have a positive ripple effect across our economy. They also produce millions of dollars for conservation and hurricane protection efforts along the coast. If these royalties decline, there will not be enough money for these critical projects. 
President Biden should reconsider his hostility toward oil and gas producers. I fear that his actions will weaken our recovery by driving up energy costs and needlessly shutting many Americans out of the workforce. These policies could also undermine America’s energy independence at a time when our adversaries are looking to exploit weaknesses. 
Republicans Defend American Energy 
Republicans have sprung into action to defend America’s energy sector. I have joined 25 other senators to request a meeting with President Biden to share our concerns about how his decisions will affect working Americans. The President needs to know that our energy independence and thousands of American livelihoods are at risk. I am also cosponsoring legislation authored by Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., which would ensure American energy producers can continue to access critical energy reservoirs in the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, I am backing legislation that would prohibit the President from blocking federal oil and gas leases without congressional approval. I will continue doing everything in my power to protect our nation’s energy resources and the thousands of Mississippi jobs they support.

Honoring Idaho’s Heroes
The Idaho National Guard consists of nearly 3,000 soldiers who train in more than 20 Idaho communities.  The Guard always maintains combat readiness to fight and win our nation’s wars.  They develop and strengthen homeland security and emergency response.  The Idaho Guardsmen build and foster partnerships throughout Idaho, the nation and around the world.  
The mission of the Idaho Army National Guard is to “maintain combat readiness and domestic emergency response capability, while building enduring partnerships throughout the state, nation, and around the world.”  This mission could not have been demonstrated in a better light than in the past few months. 
Idaho National Guardsmen in Washington D.C.
Following the violent attack on Congress on January 6, 2021, the Idaho National Guard was called upon later in the month to the United States Capitol to aid in the peaceful transition of power.  This action was unlike any other deployment the National Guard had seen.  Over 300 Idaho National Guardsmen were in the nation’s capital, along with more than 20,000 additional troops from around the country.  Our state and nation asked a lot from them during these historic times, and as always, the National Guard was ready.  The mission these men and women performed placed additional stress on families and civilian employers.  Thank you for your service.  Your unwavering commitment and service to Idaho and the nation are sincerely appreciated.
Fallen Idaho National Guardsmen
On February 2, 2021, while participating in a routine training flight, a UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter crashed near Boise.  All three individuals were killed.  Chief Warrant Officer Anderson, Chief Warrant Officer Laubhan and Chief Warrant Officer Peltzer answered the call of duty to serve our state and our nation with honor, distinction and courage.  Their service and sacrifices will not be forgotten, and their selflessness will continue to serve as an example for all of us.  I pray for the strength of comfort in the days ahead, and my sincerest condolences are with the families and friends of these heroic men.
Chief Warrant Officer (CWO) 4 Jesse Anderson was a resident of Nampa and a senior instructor pilot.  He had served in the Idaho Army National Guard since 2008.  CWO Anderson is survived by his wife and four children.
Chief Warrant Officer 3 George “Geoff” Laubhan was a resident of Boise and an instructor pilot, having served in the Idaho Army National Guard since 2010.  CWO Laubhan is survived by his wife and two children.
Chief Warrant Officer 3 Matthew Peltzer was a resident of Nampa and an instructor pilot, having served in the Idaho Army National Guard since 2005.  CWO Peltzer is survived by his wife and two children.
 
Idaho and the nation are grateful to all of those who serve.  You are the backbone of our county, and I am deeply grateful for all you have done and continue to do.  Thank you, and God bless.

2/8/21 12:52,Fighting for Michigan Through New Role as Homeland Security Committee Chairman & in U.S. Senate,"￼ 

  
Friend –  
I wanted to update you on some of the latest in the Senate as we work to address this ongoing pandemic. 
I’m excited to start my role as Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. There are a number of priorities that must be addressed, including: 
	•	Getting this pandemic under control and expanding FEMA’s role to speed up vaccination distribution efforts;  
	•	Addressing the rise in domestic terrorism and violence – particularly after the January 6th assault on the U.S. Capitol;  
	•	Boosting border security and increasing Michigan’s role as a hub for international commerce;  
	•	Strengthening our cybersecurity – especially after the recent massive cyber-attack on our federal government and private sector; and  
	•	Continuing to ensure taxpayer dollars are used more effectively and restoring the U.S. Postal Service’s longstanding tradition of reliable delivery.
In my capacity as Chairman, I’m also working to pass comprehensive, bold and robust COVID-19 relief. That’s why I recently met with President Biden and Vice President Harris at the White House to talk about the American Rescue Plan. This plan takes a number of actions that are necessary to combat this virus, from: 
	•	Extending unemployment benefits and $1,400 stimulus checks to individuals;  
	•	Increasing support for small businesses and resources to speed up safe and equitable vaccine distribution; to  
	•	Helping our schools safely reopen, under the guidance of public health officials and experts.
￼ 
I recently met at the White House with President Biden and Vice President Harris with a number of my Senate colleagues to discuss the urgent need for bold COVID relief. 
This new Congress is off to a busy start, and I will keep working to deliver results for the people of Michigan. Whether it’s getting our state through this pandemic, protecting the Great Lakes and clean water for future generations or expanding skills training and apprenticeship opportunities, I’ll always fight for Michigan. 
Thanks for reading, 
￼

Dear Lindsey Cormack,

With the second Senate impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump beginning next week, I wanted to provide an opportunity to preview this historic event and answer your questions with Walter Dellinger, former Solicitor General under President Clinton and an impeachment scholar.  I will be hosting a Facebook Live event for the impeachment trial preview on Monday, February 8, 2021 at 4:30 p.m. You can join on Monday by tuning in at facebook.com/RepDavidEPrice. 
Do you have a question about the impeachment of former President Donald Trump? Enter it here. 
The House of Representatives, in a bipartisan vote, passed one article of impeachment against former President Donald Trump on January 13, 2021. The House managers released a trial brief last week, charging former President Trump with incitement of insurrection for his role in the events prior to and on January 6, 2021. The former President’s legal team will have the opportunity to respond on Monday, February 8th, and the trial will begin Tuesday, February 9th.  
I hope you can join Walter Dellinger and me on Monday, February 8th at 4:30 p.m. on Facebook Live for a preview of former President Trump’s impeachment trial. 
Sincerely,

Luke and Alex School Safety Bill

As we approach the third anniversary of the Parkland shooting, one thing remains at the forefront of my priorities: doing all that I can to promote, enhance, and increase school safety. As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, I have secured billions in federal dollars to fund school safety initiatives, including school hardening measures, youth mental health services, and training for staff and law enforcement officers. Just last week, I had the privilege to re-introduce the Luke and Alex School Safety bill, which creates an all-inclusive site for schools, families, and community officials to obtain valuable information on school safety resources and best practices. I reiterate my gratitude to the Parkland families, including Alex's father, Max Schachter, Luke's parents, Gena and Tom Hoyer, and Gina’s father, Tony Montalto, who is the President of Stand with Parkland. They have truly turned their grief into advocacy for the safety of our children, and I cannot thank them enough for their efforts in making our schools more secure. 
￼

Reappointed to Three Appropriations Subcommittees
￼

I'm beyond thrilled to have been reappointed to serve on the Defense, and State and Foreign Operations Subcommittees on Appropriations, in addition to serving as Ranking Member of the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Subcommittee. Now, more than ever, we must ensure that the United States is equipped with the best-trained, most capable military that will continue promoting and protecting our national security interests both at home and abroad. We must also redouble our efforts to demand human rights around the world, continue to fight against the vicious cancer that is the dictatorships in Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, and support our key friend and ally, Israel. I look forward to serving my constituents on these important subcommittees.

I'm proud to have joined my colleague, Rep. Michael Waltz in introducing the BOLIVAR Act to Ban Contracting with the Maduro Regime. We must continue to support the Venezuelan people by denying resources to their oppressors, oppressors who have engaged in narco-trafficking, corrupted Venezuela’s once democratic institutions, and perpetrated egregious human rights abuses including torture, imprisonment of political opponents, and murder. I strongly support this bipartisan effort to ensure that U.S. dollars are not used to sustain the anti-American, murderous regime in Venezuela. I commend Rep. Waltz for building on his legislation from the previous Congress to protect U.S. national security interests by prohibiting U.S. contracts that enrich the Maduro dictatorship.

Dear Lindsey,

Last week, I had a productive meeting at the White House with President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, and House Democratic leaders on the urgent need for a bold, robust COVID-19 relief package. 
￼

On Friday, I helped pass a budget resolution that paves the way for getting more direct relief to families and communities that need it. We must do everything we can and use every tool at our disposal to enact President Biden's COVID-19 relief package, which includes additional direct payments, funding for vaccine distribution, and an extension of federal unemployment benefits. 

Millions are suffering -- Congress must step up and act boldly to meet the needs of the American people until this crisis ends.

Do you support President Biden's COVID-19 relief plan?

Our COVID trial, and mine: A congressman on the vaccine and his positive diagnosis

By Rep. Adriano Espaillat
Original Article Published in New York Daily
February 6, 2021


In New York City and in communities throughout the United States, COVID-19 remains a very real — and a very deadly — threat. The losses being faced by countless Americans are insurmountable, especially as we mourn the loss of more than 400,000 American lives, and livelihoods continue to be put on the line.

My district has been hit especially hard, and my heart breaks for countless of my constituents who have been directly impacted, especially those who have been forced to enter critical care at our local hospitals — many not being able to breathe, and many never leaving to see their families again.

￼

This is an unprecedented time for our communities and the availability of COVID-19 vaccines are at the crux of how we tackle this crisis.
For so many, the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines present a light at the end of the tunnel, a possibility to return to normal life, and the ability to survive this harrowing crisis. And on behalf of those Americans, I remain grateful for the steadfast efforts put forth from leaders in our scientific communities who have worked to ensure all Americans have a fighting chance against this deadly virus and the ability to return to normalcy in due course.
In December, I received the first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and then received the necessary second dose in early January. Yet on Jan. 13, 2021, I tested positive for COVID-19.

This is a hopeful story. Because the vaccine was effective, creating an antibody response to lessen the severity of symptoms associated with coronavirus, my life was saved. I was given the opportunity to live and breathe another day, an opportunity not afforded to everyone at the hands of this heartbreaking pandemic.

As the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states in its guidance, the COVID-19 vaccine is just one piece of a larger puzzle, requiring us all to continue to adhere to strict guidelines to ensure the health and safety of ourselves, our families, and those around us. Despite my best intentions and persistence in wearing a face mask, social distancing from others and vigorous personal hygiene as recommended by the CDC and our nation’s leading doctors, scientists and public health experts, I still tested positive — and you can too.

I had the privilege and opportunity to speak with Dr. Anthony Fauci, our nation’s leading infectious disease expert, after testing positive for COVID-19, and he made clear that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine I received was the sole reason I did not require immediate and intensive emergency care. Absent this vaccine, my health would have rapidly deteriorated, and quite possibly, I could have faced a fatal fate.

This vaccine undoubtedly saved my life. It could save yours too. I urge you to get your shot when you are eligibile.

Fauci made clear that even with vaccines slowly becoming more available, we must not become complacent, and we must continue to do all we can to protect the health and safety of those around us — by wearing a face mask in public settings, adhering to strict social distancing guidelines and washing our hands routinely. Only by following these steps, in tandem with vaccination, do we have a fighting chance against COVID-19.

This experience was eye-opening, and it is why I have vowed to do all I possibly can to bring more available vaccines to our neighborhoods, to get in touch with those most vulnerable in my district to help coordinate appointments, and most of all, fight to close racial equity gaps for Black, Latino, and other minority residents.

We know that our minority communities have been the hardest hit by coronavirus — from the number of lives lost, businesses forced to close, to the ongoing struggle to rebuild — and in New York, Latinos have the highest rates of infection and death among nearly all groups.

Now that vaccines have become available to eligible constituents, and after this chilling experience, my office has continued working with community partners to ensure testing and vaccination availability, and will not stop until we ensure that these resources are available and accessible to everyone — especially our most vulnerable.I encourage each and every one of you reading this today who are eligible to receive the vaccine to do so as soon as you can. I am living proof that it saves lives — and it can save yours too.

Nuestro ensayo del COVID, y el mío: Sobre la vacuna de un congresista y su diagnóstico positivo
Por Rep. Adriano Espaillat Artículo original publicado en New York Daily
6 de febrero de 2021


En la ciudad de Nueva York y en las comunidades de todo Estados Unidos, el COVID-19 sigue siendo una amenaza muy real y mortal. Las pérdidas que enfrentan innumerables estadounidenses son insuperables, especialmente la lamentable pérdida de más de 400,000 vidas estadounidenses, y los medios de subsistencia continúan en riesgo.

Mi distrito se ha visto especialmente afectado, y se me parte el corazón por un sinnúmero de mis constituyentes que se han visto afectados directamente, especialmente aquellos que se han visto obligados a ingresar a cuidados intensivos en nuestros hospitales locales; muchos son ingresados sin poder respirar y muchos se van de este mundo sin poder volver a ver a sus familias.

￼

Este es un momento sin precedentes para nuestras comunidades y la disponibilidad de las vacunas contra el COVID-19 es un elemento esencial de la forma en que enfrentaremos esta crisis.

Para muchos, las vacunas Pfizer/BioNTech y Moderna representan una luz al final del túnel, la posibilidad de volver a la vida normal y la capacidad de sobrevivir a esta desgarradora crisis. Y en nombre de esos estadounidenses, sigo agradecido por los firmes esfuerzos realizados por los líderes de nuestras comunidades científicas que han trabajado para garantizar que todos los estadounidenses tengan la oportunidad de luchar contra este virus mortal y la capacidad de volver a la normalidad a su debido tiempo.

En diciembre, recibí la primera dosis de la vacuna Pfizer/BioNTech contra el COVID-19 y luego recibí la segunda dosis necesaria a principios de enero. Sin embargo, el 13 de enero de 2021, di positivo en la prueba de COVID-19.

Esta es una historia esperanzadora. Gracias a que la vacuna fue efectiva y creó una respuesta de anticuerpos para disminuir la gravedad de los síntomas asociados con el coronavirus, me salvó la vida. Se me dio la oportunidad de vivir y respirar otro día, una oportunidad que no se brinda a todos los que han caído en manos de esta desgarradora pandemia.

Como afirman en su guía los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC) de EE.UU., la vacuna contra el COVID-19 es solo una pieza de un rompecabezas más grande, que requiere que todos sigamos cumpliendo con pautas estrictas para garantizar la salud y la seguridad de nosotros mismos, nuestras familias y los que nos rodean. A pesar de mis mejores intenciones y persistencia en el uso de mascarilla, el distanciamiento social y una higiene personal vigorosa según lo recomendado por los CDC y los principales médicos, científicos y expertos en salud pública de nuestra nación, todavía obtuve un resultado positivo, y a usted también le puede pasar.

Tuve el privilegio y la oportunidad de hablar con el Dr. Anthony Fauci, el principal experto en enfermedades infecciosas de nuestra nación, después de dar positivo por COVID-19, y él dejó en claro que la vacuna Pfizer/BioNTech que recibí era la única razón por la que no necesitaba cuidados intensivos e inmediatos de emergencia. Sin esta vacuna, mi salud se habría deteriorado rápidamente y, muy posiblemente, podría haber enfrentado un destino fatal.

Esta vacuna sin duda me salvó la vida. También podría salvar la tuya. Le pido que se vacune cuando sea elegible.
Fauci dejó en claro que incluso con las vacunas cada vez más disponibles, no debemos volvernos complacientes y debemos continuar haciendo todo lo posible para proteger la salud y la seguridad de quienes nos rodean, usando una mascarilla en entornos públicos, observando estrictas pautas de distanciamiento social, y lavándonos las manos constantemente. Solo siguiendo estos pasos, junto con la vacunación, tenemos una oportunidad de luchar contra el COVID-19.

Esta experiencia fue reveladora, y es por eso por lo que he prometido hacer todo lo posible para traer más vacunas disponibles a nuestros vecindarios, para ponerme en contacto con los más vulnerables en mi distrito para ayudar a coordinar citas y, sobre todo, luchar para cerrar las brechas de equidad racial para los residentes afroamericanos, latinos y otras minorías.

Sabemos que nuestras comunidades minoritarias han sido las más afectadas por el coronavirus, tanto por el número de vidas perdidas, como por los negocios obligados a cerrar, y las dificultades en curso para reconstruir; y en Nueva York, los latinos tienen las tasas más altas de infección y muerte entre casi todos los otros grupos.

Ahora que las vacunas están disponibles para los constituyentes elegibles, y después de esta experiencia escalofriante, mi oficina ha continuado trabajando con socios comunitarios para garantizar la disponibilidad de las pruebas y las vacunas, y no se detendrá hasta que nos aseguremos de que estos recursos estén disponibles y accesibles para todos, especialmente para nuestros constituyentes más vulnerables. Los animo a todos y cada uno de los que leen esto hoy y son elegibles para recibir la vacuna a que la tomen lo antes posible. Soy la prueba viviente de que salva vidas, y también puede salvar la suya.

SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loans Available in Michigan Following Secretary of Agriculture Disaster Declaration for Excessive Rain

Washington - The U.S. Small Business Administration announced today that Economic Injury Disaster Loans are available to small businesses, small agricultural cooperatives, small businesses engaged in aquaculture, and private nonprofit organizations in Michigan due to excessive rain on Sept. 30, 2020.

Low-interest disaster loans are available in the counties of Alger, Cheboygan, Chippewa, Emmet, Luce, Mackinac and Schoolcraft in Michigan. 

“When the Secretary of Agriculture issues a disaster declaration to help farmers recover from damages and losses to crops, the Small Business Administration issues a declaration to eligible entities, affected by the same disaster,” said Kem Fleming, director of SBA’s Field Operations Center East. 

Under this declaration, the SBA’s Economic Injury Disaster Loan program is available to eligible farmrelated and nonfarm-related entities that suffered financial losses as a direct result of this disaster. Except for aquaculture enterprises, SBA cannot provide disaster loans to agricultural producers, farmers and ranchers.

The loan amount can be up to $2 million with interest rates of 3 percent for small businesses and 2.75 percent for private nonprofit organizations of all sizes, with terms up to 30 years. The SBA determines eligibility based on the size of the applicant, type of activity and its financial resources. Loan amounts and terms are set by the SBA and are based on each applicant’s financial condition. These working capital loans may be used to pay fixed debts, payroll, accounts payable, and other bills that could have been paid had the disaster not occurred. The loans are not intended to replace lost sales or profits.

Applicants may apply online using the Electronic Loan Application (ELA) via SBA’s secure website at DisasterLoan.sba.gov and should apply under SBA declaration # 16866, not for the COVID-19 incident.

Disaster loan information and application forms may also be obtained by calling the SBA’s Customer Service Center at 800-659-2955 (800-877-8339 for the deaf and hard-of-hearing) or by sending an email to DisasterCustomerService@sba.gov. Loan application forms can be downloaded from sba.gov/disaster. Completed applications should be mailed to: U.S. Small Business Administration, Processing and Disbursement Center, 14925 Kingsport Road, Fort Worth, TX 76155.

Submit completed loan applications to SBA no later than Oct. 4, 2021.

2/8/21 16:49,Swearing In a New President,"February 8, 2021
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email
￼
Dear Friends, 

I hope this newsletter finds you healthy and well. Much has happened over the past few weeks, including the inauguration of a new President. It’s been a busy time for me too—I have been hard at work since the 117th Congress was sworn in. Keep reading to learn more about what I have accomplished and what I hope to get done in the weeks ahead.
 
￼
 Working in Washington on behalf of my constituents.

Swearing In a New President
After the chaos and pain of the past four years, it was difficult to feel anything but relief and hope for the future as I watched Joe Biden take the oath of office to become President. His Presidency promises to be everything his predecessor’s wasn’t—science driven, guided by fundamental values of fairness and integrity, and committed to addressing the urgent issues of our day, like income inequality and climate change. Thus far, I’ve been deeply encouraged by President Biden’s leadership. In the few weeks since he assumed office, President Biden has already worked to correct Trump’s injustices by reversing the Muslim Ban and forming a task force to reunite families separated at the border, taken executive action to fight climate change and strengthen the Affordable Care Act, and expanded the federal government’s ability to respond to COVID-19.
There is much work ahead of us. The public health and economic impacts of COVID-19 continue to ravage our nation, reforming policing remains a top priority, and the threat posed by the climate crisis grows more urgent with every passing day. I and my Democratic colleagues in the House are eager to lead on these issues—and the many more impacting Americans—and I look forward to working closely with President Biden in the weeks and months ahead.
Impeaching Trump for Inciting an Insurrection
The insurrection against the Capitol on January 6th was terrifying, horrifying to watch, and above all, clearly incited by former President Trump’s rhetoric. That is not a political statement, nor should it come as any surprise to anyone who has been watching Trump’s conduct over the past four years—when I warned about the danger of Trump’s lies and rhetoric at his first impeachment over a year ago, it was exactly this kind of outcome that I feared. 
Trump’s lies about the reliability of our election whipped his supporters into a frenzy that ultimately cost six lives. When we serve, we hold the public’s trust in our hands. To violate that trust as wantonly and dishonestly as he has over the past several months is not only unforgivable, it poses a clear and present danger to our Republic. With his conduct posing a clear menace to our democratic order—and with him having made clear that he had no intention of changing his behavior—I called for his immediate impeachment. I’m glad that House Democrats acted decisively to impeach Trump and I’m grateful that his behavior received bipartisan condemnation. This was not a step taken lightly, but it was necessary, and it was the right step to take. Now, conviction rests in the hands of the Senate. I urge them to convict Trump and ensure that he can never again hold office and cause further harm to our nation.
Delivering the American People the COVID19 Relief They Need
This December, I voted in support of the Congressional Coronavirus relief package, which was shortly thereafter signed into law. The package came up short in certain key areas—I had called for and was disappointed by the lack of additional funding for state and local governments, independent restaurants, and expanded direct payments to the American people—but for millions of Americans, whose unemployment benefits were about to run out or whose small businesses were on the brink of going out of businesses, anything was better than nothing. That said, I am proud of many of the provisions included within the package. Whether it was $25 billion in rental assistance, the reopening of the Paycheck Protection Program and the inclusion of Co-ops, or eleven additional weeks of unemployment insurance, this aid package will make—and already has made—a vast difference in the lives of many. For more detailed information, including on how to apply for small business relief programs such as the Shuttered Venue Operator Grants, and questions if you have not received your stimulus check, please click here. 
Guided by President Biden’s leadership, Democrats in Congress are already hard at work negotiating the next relief package, which I hope will be more ambitious and wide-reaching than what we passed in December. As the American people struggle to weather a crisis of unprecedented proportion, the federal government must continue to serve as a force for good. I will do all I can to ensure Congress delivers support to those most in need.
Making Progress on New York City’s Transportation Priorities
A New York City with safe, efficient transportation infrastructure is a vibrant New York City. That’s why meeting New York City’s transportation needs has always been among my very top priorities—it’s why I have and will continue to fight so hard for federal funds to help the MTA recover from COVID19—and it’s why I’ve already taken action this Congress to address transportation issues facing our city.
Shortly after the 117th Congress began in January, I introduced the Safe and Quiet Skies Act to regulate the commercial air tours that buzz loudly over the New York skyline. Not only do these low-flying helicopters and small planes cause noise and environmental pollution, they also crash with shocking regularity and put both New Yorkers’ and tourists’ lives at risk.
President Biden’s swearing-in makes me hopeful for New York’s long-standing transportation needs. President Biden—who many fondly refer to as ‘Amtrak Joe’ due to his famous daily Amtrak commute—knows better than most how important a functional, streamlined rail system is for a city and its economy.  With that in mind, I look forward to working closely with the President on expanding the Gateway tunnels that run under the Hudson river and desperately need to be rebuilt. A revitalized Gateway program would deliver jobs, high-speed rail, reduced carbon emissions, and much more to New Yorkers who have already had to wait too long. I look forward to working with President Biden on getting it done.

Sincerely,

Rep. Weber Statement on Rep. Ron Wright's Passing
Washington, D.C. – Monday, February 8, 2021 U.S. Representative Randy Weber (TX-14) issued the following statement on the passing of Representative Ron Wright (TX-6):   ""Last night, we lost a fellow Texan, a true patriot and a friend.  Representative Ron Wright, a fellow member of the Freedom Caucus, dedicated his life to working for the people of Texas. He was a servant of the Most High GOD. Through his many years of public service, Ron personified what it means to be a conservative.  He always fought for his constituents and to secure our founding principles with integrity.  Although Ron will truly be missed, his contributions to the people of Texas and our nation – not to mention his trademark bowtie -- will always be remembered. 
""I was truly blessed to call Ron not only a colleague but a friend. Brenda and I are deeply saddened by the news of his passing. We will see him again. As JESUS promised in John 16:22: 'Therefore, you too have grief now; but I will see you again, and your heart will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.'
""In the meantime, our prayers are with his wife, Susan, and their three children during this challenging time.""

Item 2



Senator Collins Thanks Maine National Guard Soldiers for Keeping U.S. Capitol Safe
￼ 
U.S. Senator Susan Collins visited hundreds of Maine National Guard soldiers in Washington, D.C., to thank them for providing additional security at the U.S. Capitol over the past several weeks and keeping the Inauguration safe.  
￼
Following the riot on January 6, members of the Maine National Guard joined thousands of National Guard troops from across the country in assisting federal law enforcement with protecting the grounds of the U.S. Capitol.   ""I am so proud of the members of the Maine National Guard who answered the call to protect the Capitol, temporarily leaving their loved ones and jobs to defend our democracy,” said Senator Collins.  “These brave men and women from the Maine National Guard are carrying out their mission in D.C. with the utmost professionalism.  It was an honor to thank them in person before they return home.""  
￼
On a Sunday evening two weeks ago, Senator Collins met with Maine National Guard personnel from the 251st Engineer Company based in Norway, the 136th Engineer Company based in Lewiston and Skowhegan, and the 185th Engineer Company based in Houlton at the hotel where they were staying while off duty.  She spoke about what it was like inside the Capitol when the barricades were breached last month, and she expressed how grateful Members of Congress and staff are that the National Guard units deployed to secure the Capitol while the risk to the complex remains high.    Most of the initial group of the Maine National Guard soldiers have returned to Maine, but several members of these units extended their assignments and are continuing to serve in D.C.  Last week, Senator Collins also visited nearly two dozen members of the 488th Military Police Company based in Waterville who are preserving the peace around the U.S. Capitol.

Dear Neighbor, 
 
In 2020, Colorado battled one of the most devastating and brutal wildfire seasons we've ever seen. In the span of just a few months, our state experienced three of the five largest wildfires in state history, including the Cameron Peak and East Troublesome fires, which impacted communities in our district. These wildfires forced countless evacuations, threatened air and water quality and destroyed homes and businesses. 
  
  
  
 
Have you been impacted by this year's wildfires?
 
  
 
Yes
 
  
 
No
 
  
  
Submit survey to sign up for updates on my work in Congress.* 
  
WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU. 
 
On February 18th, my office is hosting a wildfire summit to hear from Coloradans about their experiences this wildfire season. Join me, Governor Jared Polis, Senator Michael Bennet and Senator John Hickenlooper from 12:00 p.m. to 1:00 p.m. for a public conversation about wildfire mitigation and future wildfire prevention. Visit Neguse2021.com for more information and to register.

Over the last few months, we've partnered with local firefighters, state and local officials to help our communities weather these fires and recover. 
 
HERE'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON: 
	•	We helped ensure first responders and firefighters are prioritized for COVID-19 testing, 
	•	We helped secure a disaster declaration for Colorado's wildfires to bring in needed federal resources for our state; 
	•	We worked to bring in FEMA funding for the Cameron Peak, East Troublesome and Calwood Fires and introduced the Wildfire Recovery Act to boost the federal cost share so our local communities carry less of the burden, 
	•	We introduced legislation to make major investments in wildfire mitigation and resiliency programs, 
	•	and we launched the Bipartisan Wildfire Caucus in Congress to highlight these issues. 
We will continue to utilize every mechanism at our disposal to provide needed resources to protect our communities from catastrophic fires. 
 
Thank you for sharing your feedback! 
 
All the best,

Dear Friend,   Thanks for reading my Week in Review newsletter. You can sign up for my weekly updates and other issue-specific newsletters here. Please remember to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube for regular updates on how I am serving the people of South Carolina!    Pandemic Recovery: A Conservative Approach   Last week the Democrats voted to put politics ahead of facts and science. In a vote series that lasted more than 14 hours, my colleagues on the Left blocked a number of amendments to a budget resolution that would have protected South Carolinians and people across this country suffering from the physical and economic fall-out from the coronavirus.  I introduced amendments to protect our elderly people, get kids back in classrooms, prevent harmful tax increases, and stop an artificial minimum wage increase during a pandemic that has already caused millions of businesses to close their doors. Democrats unanimously blocked my amendment that would require states to accurately report data about the number of COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes. I know we must have accurate information to protect the most vulnerable among us. While the Democrats voted against this amendment, I will never stop fighting to protect our seniors.  I was glad that my amendments on stopping tax increases and a minimum wage hike during a pandemic—which would close businesses and eliminate jobs—passed. We launched a video series last week that explains just how harmful a government-mandated minimum wage hike would be. Click here to watch our First and Second videos in the series.  Launching My 46-County Tour   I am proud to carry on a tradition I started when joining the Senate of visiting all 46 counties in South Carolina. While my 46-county tour is virtual this time, it is important to me to hear from everyday South Carolinians about what makes their county unique. For the first stop on my tour, I virtually visited Orangeburg to speak with first-generation farmer Antron Williams. In my conversation with Antron we talked about the resilient history of the citizens of Orangeburg, the contributions of African American farmers, and the impact farmers have on their local communities.  I am so glad technology has made it possible for me to continue these conversations with folks across the Palmetto State as we work to re-open our economy, get our kids back in school, and ensure a stronger economic landscape today and greater educational opportunity for generations to come. If you have ideas on where I should go next on my virtual tour, email my team at countytour@scott.senate.gov.  National Prayer Breakfast   Last week, I had the opportunity to once again co-chair the annual National Prayer Breakfast. While this year’s event looked a little different, it served as a special reminder that we are still united in our shared belief that we are a stronger nation because of our faith in God. My prayer for our state and our country is that, even in the midst of chaos and uncertainty, we can trust in the promise that better days are ahead.

2/8/21 18:05,📰 Nikema's Notes for February 2021,"

￼
￼
Dear Lindsey,

In my first month of the 117th Congress, we hit the ground running to certify the electoral college votes to conclude the democratic process. Despite an attack by domestic terrorists attempting to silence the voices of millions of voters, we accomplished our goal. However, it is unconscionable that a sitting President would incite such violence on the temple of American democracy.

For this reason, I voted for the second impeachment of President Trump. Additionally, on Jan. 18, I introduced a resolution (H.Con.Res.6) to prohibit Donald Trump from entering the U.S. Capitol. Click here to read the press release on my legislation. 

Some people question the purpose of pursuing such actions against the President even after his term ended. No one is above the law, and he must be tried and convicted by the Senate to ensure that no future president ever thinks they can do the same thing and get away with it. 

I came to Congress to make a difference, defend our democracy and protect the rights of the American people, especially the rights of Fifth Congressional District residents. Celebrating Black History Month after commemorating the 35th Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. holiday last month, the spirit of these commemorations only reaffirm my decision to become a public servant. And, to succeed our beloved Congressman John Lewis, I have an obligation to build on his legacy of equal rights and social justice, while working to make the ""Beloved Community"" a reality. We've come too far to turn back now.

Thank you for signing up to receive my e-newsletter. Visit my website at nikemawilliams.house.gov to stay up-to-date on my activities and resources available to you. If you ever need more information, feel free to contact my District or D.C. Office and my staff will be happy to assist you.

Being sworn in to represent Georgia's Fifth Congressional District will forever be a highlight of my life.

While I am succeeding the late Congressman John Lewis, I know that I will never be able to replace him. I can only carry the torch he passed to me.

As your Congresswoman, I am dedicated to ensuring the Fifth Congressional District has a voice in Congress.

On January 20, I witnessed the 59th Inaugural Ceremonies at the U.S. Capitol.

It was an honor to witness the transfer of power to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. They are both leaders dedicated to serving the American people and I look forward to working with them so we can reunite America.

The transfer of power proved that we will not let terrorists win and we are united behind our democracy.

The men and women from the two Georgia National Guard Task Forces assembled in Washington D.C. deserve a huge thank you. 

Over 1,100 soldiers from Georgia were in Washington D.C. January 15 - 24, 2021. Because of their professionalism, the 59th Presidential Inauguration Ceremonies took place safely. I am so proud of that Georgian spirit and your commitment to duty and service to the country.

Committee Assignments for the 117th Congress

On Dec. 18, 2020, before I was even sworn in, I was appointed to the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure by Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Speaker Pelosi later appointed me to the House Financial Services Committee. I was appointed to my third committee, the Committee on the Modernization of Congress, on Jan. 27.

An appointment to the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress is an opportunity to make Congress work for the people. 

On the Financial Services Committee, I will be a force for economic justice. My experiences as a Black woman are why I will lift up the voices of marginalized communities as a member of the Diversity and Inclusion and Oversight and Investigations subcommittees as I strive to make the promise of America a reality for all.   

The Fifth Congressional District is home to the world’s busiest airport, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International. My service on the Transportation and Infrastructure committee will amplify the District's role in key projects and decisions. Serving on both the Aviation and Highways and Transit the subcommittees of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, we will move forward with the infrastructure needed for an economy that works for every American, no matter their ZIP code.

Congressman DeSaulnier Votes to Remove Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from Committees
This week, Congressman DeSaulnier voted with his colleagues in the House to remove Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from the Education and Labor Committee and the Budget Committee following her incendiary remarks regarding school shootings and executing certain Democratic politicians, which Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell called ""loony lies and conspiracy theories"" that amounted to a ""cancer"" in the Republican Conference. The measure passed the House by a vote of 230-to-199, with 11 Republicans voting in support. In addition to the vote, Congressman DeSaulnier sponsors legislation to censure Rep. Taylor Greene and to have her expelled from Congress.

February 8, 2021
Former President Trump Must be Convicted in the Senate 
A MESSAGE FROM CONGRESSMAN STENY H. HOYER     
The January 6th attack on the United States Capitol was an attack on our democracy, and the very core of American ideals and values. Former President Donald Trump’s effort to overturn the clear election result led to the insurrection we saw on January 6. This week, the Senate will begin the second impeachment trial of former President Trump to hold him accountable for inciting that insurrection. The mob that stormed the Capitol was clearly inspired by, and called to action by, former President Trump. During his speech to the crowd on January 6, the President used the words ‘fight’ or ‘fighting’ 20 times as he instructed his supporters to ‘stop the steal.’ He organized the mob, inflamed the mob, and deployed them to the Capitol.  They assaulted police officers and killed one; terrorized and endangered the lives of Members, staffers, and reporters; and sought to inflict damage to an institution that we hold dear. Former President Trump must be held accountable for the insurrection he encouraged. That is why I believe my Republican colleagues must show courage and convict former President Trump during the upcoming impeachment trial. 
Leaders must be held accountable for their actions. That’s why I brought to the House Floor a resolution last week to remove Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene from her House Committees. When I spoke on the House Floor in support of the resolution, I spoke about Rep. Greene’s violent political rhetoric and said, ‘No member ought to be permitted to engage in the kind of behavior that Rep. Greene has and face zero consequences.’ I also said that ‘to do nothing would be an abdication of our moral responsibility to our colleagues, to the House, to our values, to the truth, and to our country.’ 
 
Click here to watch Congressman Hoyer's Floor remarks on Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.  
We must hold our leaders accountable for their actions. Whether it is inciting a mob that resulted in the death of civilians and law enforcement officers, whether it is speech that is racist, anti-Semitic, and endorses the execution of Members of Congress, Congress has the responsibility to demonstrate our commitment, both as leaders and as citizens, to keeping America a republic and holding leaders accountable.  
As always, I encourage all Fifth District residents to continue to share their concerns and insights with me by contacting my office or connecting with me on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram.If you are experiencing a personal difficulty such as issues accessing veterans benefits or another problem regarding a federal agency and you wish for my office to place an inquiry on your behalf, please complete the casework request form by clicking here.

￼ 
Dear Friends,
I came to Washington in 2015 to reign in deficit spending and call out wasteful government spending. I brought back the late Sen. William Proxmire’s “Golden Fleece Award” to highlight frivolous and wasteful uses of taxpayer money.
That’s why I in good conscience could not support the budget bill that crossed the Floor this week, H. Con. Res. 11 that green lights President Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID relief package. This package includes proposals that have nothing to do with assisting Arkansas families, workers, and small businesses and it’s a repeat of nearly $1 trillion of spending from 2020 that hasn’t even been spent yet.  
In 2020, Congress enacted more than $3.4 trillion in COVID-19 relief. The White House and House Democratic leadership have failed to address the fact that more than $1 trillion in resources remain to be spent from the COVID relief laws enacted in 2020. This includes 
	•	$280 billion in urgent help for small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program
	•	$239 billion for health care spending
	•	$172 billion for unemployment insurance
	•	$59 billion for schools and teachers
	•	$58 billion for states and local governments. 
Congress has a responsibility to craft a fiscally responsible budget that includes broad, balanced, and bipartisan agreements to fund our government.
Instead, Democrats have chosen to make a power grab to further their own political agenda. That’s not putting Americans first. 

STOPPING CHINA'S PREDATORY LENDING
This week in the Wall Street Journal and on Fox & Friends First I blew the whistle on another terrible Democrat idea.
Democrats in Congress are pushing to direct the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to send billions of dollars to wealthy countries and rogue regimes like Russia, Iran, and Venezuela. The biggest winner? China. 
China is the world’s largest creditor, and the Chinese Communist Party wants third-world countries caught in its predatory debt trap to use American taxpayer dollars at the IMF to pay China back.
On Thursday, I joined Todd Piro on Fox & Friends First to discuss my op-ed Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal about how requiring the IMF to issue special drawing rights (SDRs) to all member countries would harm the global economy. Watch HERE.  
￼

FIGHTING BAD DEMOCRAT POLICIES 
On Friday, I voted against the National Apprenticeship Act, and let me tell you why. 
Congress should be favoring employer-led innovation to get Americans back to work and not creating obstacles to job growth and reinforcing a broken, 80-year-old system.
The bill requires a small business to partner with a union in order to get job workforce development funding.  My amendment to make that a union OR non-union organization was rejected by Democrats because of their deep ties to union interests. 
It is unfortunate that Democrats would prioritize putting more money in the pocket of organized labor over expanding opportunities to get Americans back to the work in the midst of this public health and economic crisis. 
Read my op-ed in the Washington Times for more of my thoughts on this.  
￼

SUPPORTING ARKANSAS SMALL BUSINESSES
In this new Congress, I have been asked to continue serving as the Ranking Member on the House Committee on Financial Services Subcommittee on National Security, International Development and Monetary Policy. On Thursday, I helped lead a virtual hearing with Subcommittee Chairman Jim Himes (D-CT) on the resources available to small businesses as our economy reopens. 
I was proud to highlight the important work that Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) like Southern Bancorp in central Arkansas do to support small businesses across our nation. I supported increased funding for CDFIs in both the CARES Act and the subsequent COVID-19 relief packages passed last year, and I am committed to supporting small business owners in Arkansas during the economic recovery process. 
Watch my opening remarks and questions from the hearing HERE or by clicking on the image below.

REMEMBERING OFFICER BRIAN SICKNICK 
On Wednesday, United States Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick laid in honor in the Capitol Rotunda. I was humbled and honored to join my friend Congressman Ed Perlmutter (CO-7) to pay our respects to Officer Sicknick who gave his life to protect our temple of democracy during the January 6th attack on the United States Capitol. Together, Ed and I have introduced H. Res. 39 to recognize the sacrifice of law enforcement on January 6th, including the loss of Officer Sicknick. 
I invite all Arkansans to join me in praying for peace and healing for Officer Sicknick’s family and for the continued safety of the men and women of the United States Capitol Police.

PRAYING FOR OUR NATION
On Thursday morning, I joined the 69th National Prayer Breakfast, where I reflected on how our respective religions bring our nation closer together. 
I appreciated the opportunity to gather with my colleagues and hear from faith leaders who spoke at the breakfast. I was especially inspired by the words of Ambassador Andrew Young who spoke about the honesty, love, confidence, and trust that comes from faith. I was inspired and encouraged by the music from We The Kingdom.

PREPARING FOR TAX SEASON
Tax season starts on Friday, February 12th, 2021, when the IRS will begin accepting and processing 2020 tax year returns. The IRS is taking steps to process filings quickly and issue refunds to Arkansans. 
I encourage all Arkansans to file their taxes electronically with direct deposit as the IRS recommends. You can begin filing tax returns immediately with tax software companies, including IRS Free File partners. These groups are starting to accept tax returns now, and the returns will be transmitted to the IRS starting February 12th.  
If you did not receive the first or second Economic Impact Payment and believe you qualify, you can claim one using the Recovery Rebate Credit on your 2020 tax return. Tax preparation software, including IRS Free File, will help taxpayers figure the amount.
Please contact me at (501) 324-5941 or Hill.House.Gov if you have any questions. We are ready and willing to help Arkansans. 


CELEBRATING WORLD READ ALOUD DAY 
Wednesday was Scholastic’s World Read Aloud Day, which celebrates the cultural and educational importance of sharing stories. 
It was great to join students at Greenbrier Eastside Elementary School in Greenbrier, Arkansas for a virtual reading of Goodnight Little Rock by Little Rock native and University of Central Arkansas alumna, Emily Wyatt. 
I encourage all Arkansans to continue the celebration by sharing stories with family and friends.

2/8/21 20:50,9 Things You Missed Last Week,"A message from US Senator Todd Young
￼ 


Opposing Divisive Partisan Overreach on COVID-19 Relief
Last year, the Senate approved five COVID-19 relief packages in overwhelmingly bipartisan fashion. As we look at an additional round of relief, I have been outspoken on the need for it to be bipartisan as well. I have shown my willingness to do that last week as one of 10 Republican Senators who met with President Biden after proposing a more targeted COVID-19 relief package.  President Biden has emphasized his desire for unity, but actions from his Democratic counterparts in Congress aren’t matching up to his rhetoric. Their plan to ram a one-sided COVID-19 package through Congress without bipartisan negotiation is the exact opposite of unity. We should be working together to get vaccines in arms, provide small business relief, and get our kids back to school. But instead, national Democrats are prioritizing a partisan package that focuses more on liberal priorities that have nothing to do with the pandemic, such as bailing out fiscally irresponsible states and raising the minimum wage. I’m disappointed this is the approach Democrats in Congress have chosen to take.   Click here to watch my interview on Fox News discussing the matter.  
￼ 
My Amendment to Prohibit Stimulus Checks for Illegal Immigrants  
Last Thursday, I introduced an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Resolution that would prohibit any future Economic Impact Payments (EIPs) or similar direct stimulus payments from being distributed to illegal immigrants, which is aligned with the same eligibility criteria for the first two rounds of EIPs.  Stimulus checks were intended to provide a lifeline to Americans struggling to make ends meet during the coronavirus pandemic. They were not intended for people who are in our country illegally. Our amendment would ensure that people who break our immigration laws aren’t receiving taxpayer-funded handouts.  It would establish a dangerous precedent if the federal government were to give a direct cash payment to those who have jumped the line and subverted our nation’s immigration system to enter the United States. I was pleased the Senate has passed our amendment on a bipartisan basis, but Senator Chuck Schumer ultimately stripped the provision from the bill in the middle of the night. I plan to continue to fight for these important taxpayer protections as the next COVID relief bill is debated.  It is important to note that this amendment would have no impact on EIP eligibility for mixed-status families, an issue that was remedied in a bipartisan fashion as part of the December COVID relief package.  Click here or on the image below to watch my floor speech.  
￼ 
The REINS Act to Curb Costly Regulations  
We have made significant progress reining in costly, job-killing regulations since I first introduced the REINS Act in the House eight years ago, but as we enter a new administration, it is more important than ever that we pass this legislation. Congress must play a role in approving major federal rules and regulations to ensure Americans’ best interests are being considered by elected officials who can be held accountable, not just unelected bureaucrats in Washington.  The REINS Act would protect taxpayers by requiring that Congress affirmatively approve every new major rule proposed by the Executive Branch before it can be enforced.  
Call to Move the 2022 Olympic Games Out of Communist China 
Last week, I reintroduced a resolution calling on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to move the 2022 Winter Olympics out of Communist China and rebid it to another country unless Beijing immediately addresses its egregious and numerous violations of human rights. 

The Chinese Communist Party’s horrific record of human rights abuses should not be rewarded by allowing them to host the 2022 Olympic Winter Games. The Olympic Games are about coming together and showcasing the best athletes around the world. The Chinese Communist Party’s actions in Xinjiang, Hong Kong, and elsewhere makes such unity impossible. The International Olympic Committee should abandon plans for the 2022 Games in China and seek out a new host country that respects the most basic human rights. 
Supporting our Child Care Workforce 
My Early Educators Apprenticeship Act supports the role of apprenticeships in improving child care affordability and provides professional development opportunities to potential child care workers, which is more important than ever as we continue to navigate the coronavirus pandemic. This bill is especially critical in rural areas, including many communities in Indiana, where finding affordable child care is particularly challenging in normal times, and even more dire during the current public health crisis. 
Tax Credit to Encourage Revitalization of Distressed Homes
Last week, I reintroduced a bipartisan bill to revitalize housing in distressed neighborhoods nationwide. The Neighborhood Homes Investment Act (NHIA) will help address the housing affordability crisis, create jobs, and encourage economic development during these tough times. By providing a tax credit to remove and redevelop abandoned buildings, we can incentivize more affordable housing to be constructed in areas that are in need of rehabilitation. This legislation will benefit many struggling communities in Indiana seeking to revitalize amid this pandemic.
Urging Biden Administration to Support Indiana Auto Manufacturing by Addressing Global Semiconductor Shortage 
In a bipartisan letter to Director of the National Economic Council Brian Deese, I urged him to work with Congress in addressing the global semiconductor shortage facing auto manufacturing. According to the Indiana Economic Development Council, over 100,000 Hoosiers work in the automotive manufacturing industry, which has over 500 automotive companies located in Indiana alone. The automotive industry contributes well over $15 billion to Indiana’s economy. This shortage threatens our post-pandemic economic recovery, and the consequences stand to be especially acute in dominant auto manufacturing states like ours.  Click here to learn more.  
Protecting Journalists and Promoting Press Freedom Around The World 
Freedom of the press is essential to democracy, good governance, and holding those in power accountable. This principle was enshrined in our founding documents for that reason. Because our values do not stop at our border, I am proud of the bipartisan Global Press Freedom Act that will empower our diplomats to support a free press around the globe.
Paying Respects to Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick 
On Thursday, I paid my respects to U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick as he laid in honor in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. His bravery and sacrifice for our nation on January 6 will be remembered by all.

Announcing Committee Assignments for the 117th Congress 
This week, I received my committee assignments for the 117th Congress. I am pleased to announce that I will continue serving as the lead Republican on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee and that I added a new committee assignment as a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.   It was my request to serve on the Senate Health committee while we are in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Serving on both Senate Health and Appropriations committees will be extremely beneficial to Kansans as we work to manufacture more vaccines, tests and PPE to help end this pandemic. The committee has jurisdiction over the Centers for Disease Control, Food and Drug Administration and National Institutes of Health, and serving on HELP and Appropriations will be beneficial to Kansas as we work to manufacture more vaccines, tests and PPE to help end this pandemic.  Additionally, I am honored to continue serving as the top Republican on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee and will work to make certain our veterans have the resources they need to achieve success in their life after service.   I will serve on the following committees for the 117th Congress: 
	•	U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations
	•	U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs
	•	U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation
	•	U.S. Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions
	•	U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs
	•	U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs (Ranking Member)
I am committed to using my role on these influential committees to advocate for our farmers, ranchers, Native Americans, veterans, manufacturers, innovators, students, moms and dads to deliver results to the great state of Kansas

Urging a Bipartisan Solution for Federal COVID-19 Relief 
On Monday, I joined nine of my Republican Senate colleagues to meet with President Biden at the White House to discuss our targeted $600 billion federal relief proposal. This COVID-19 relief package is built on a foundation of bipartisan ideas and would rein in Biden’s $1.9 trillion plan. During our discussion, I encouraged the President to support a targeted, less expensive plan, and to get it done quickly in a bipartisan fashion to benefit Americans.  President Biden has pledged bipartisan cooperation, and I hope he will rise to that promise by working with both sides of the aisle in Congress to pass a bipartisan relief package to meet the ongoing challenges of this crisis.  Later in the week, I joined Pete Mundo on KCMO Talk Radio to discuss my meeting at the White House and the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion proposal that is filled with partisan wish list items and does not appropriately respond to the needs of the American public.  Last year, Congress spent $4 trillion on bipartisan COVID-19 relief packages to support Americans as our country faced the challenges of this pandemic. The latest COVID-19 relief package provided $900 billion in additional resources and was signed into law on December 27, 2020. Much of that assistance is only now being disbursed. This next bill, which President Biden agreed must be a sincere, bipartisan effort to work with Republicans, must be legislation that best serves America both today and into the future. 
  
FY2021 Budget Resolution 
Early Friday morning, following 15 hours of debate and roll call votes on more than 40 amendments, the Senate passed a FY2021 budget resolution. While the budget resolution does not carry the force of law and would not be signed by the President, it establishes a fast track process known as reconciliation which Congressional Democrats are expected to use to pass a $1.9 trillion stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Through reconciliation, Democrats have the ability to ultimately pass that legislation along party lines with a simple majority vote, bypassing the 60-vote threshold necessary for most Senate legislation to become law.  Many amendments considered during the marathon voting session were intended as legislative placeholders, designed to send messages about Senators’ policy priorities. I was pleased an amendment I cosponsored to strengthen the Provider Relief Fund to help prevent hospitals from closing their doors – particularly in rural and underserved regions – was included in the budget resolution. Several other provisions I supported, including amendments to fund our nation’s police, maintain the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem and preserve the Trump administration’s Navigable Waters Protection rule were also passed on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis.  Unfortunately, while every federal COVID-19 relief package thus far has been passed by Congress in a bipartisan fashion, this partisan budget resolution – passing 51-50 with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tiebreaking vote – indicates Democrats in Congress no longer intend to work together on pandemic relief to meet the needs of the American people. It was just last week that President Biden hosted me and colleagues of mine from a bipartisan working group in the Senate at the White House to discuss a better path forward on a more targeted and responsible COVID-19 relief package. I remain committed to holding the President accountable for his promise of working with both sides of the aisle to help Congress meet the ongoing challenges of this crisis. 
  
Providing Food Security for Rural Americans 
This week, I joined three of my Senate colleagues in introducing the Healthy Food Access for All Americans (HFAAA) Act. This legislation aims to expand access to affordable and nutritious food in areas designated as “food deserts” by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), areas defined to be without grocery stores within one or more miles in urban regions and ten or more miles in rural regions.  Over the past year, we have seen unprecedented need at food banks as Kansans line up seeking access to nutritional food. Even while living in the breadbasket of our nation, food insecurity affects far too many Kansans, a need that has only increased during COVID-19. This bipartisan legislation, which would incentivize food providers to establish and renovate grocery stores, food banks and farmers markets in communities that traditionally lack affordable, healthy and convenient food options, is now more important than ever during this pandemic. 
  
￼ 
  
Supporting Modernized Job Training and High-Speed Broadband Access 
This week, I joined my colleagues on the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee in introducing the Telecommunications Skilled Workforce Act. This legislation would work to address the shortage of trained workers necessary to fill next-generation jobs in the telecommunications industry in communities throughout the country. As our country continues to work towards providing high-speed broadband connectivity to all parts of the country, including the deployment of 5G mobile broadband, there is a growing demand for a skilled workforce that would support this effort. This legislation takes another step to help bridge the digital divide in rural areas like those in Kansas, but would also work to increase the number of well-paying jobs in the economy, supporting our rural workforce in the wake of this pandemic. As the lead Republican on the Senate Commerce Subcommittee with jurisdiction over workforce development, I will continue to support modernized training programs that help produce the highly-skilled workforce needed in a globalized economy. 
  
￼ 
  
Seeking Information Regarding President Biden’s VA Supplemental Funding Request 
This week, I joined Congressman Mike Bost, Ranking Member of the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee, in requesting an explanation from VA’s Acting Secretary Dat Tran regarding President Biden’s request for an additional $17 billion in emergency COVID-19 funding for the department.  I have expressed my commitment to make certain VA has all the resources it needs to deliver care and benefits to our veterans during the pandemic, and I will support additional funding and supplies so VA employees have the necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) and the proper frontline staff to give our veterans the care they deserve. I expressed my concern, however, that this new request for $17 billion, which is in addition to $19.6 billion in emergency funding and $243 billion in regular funding, is not based on a demonstrated need from the department.  VA officials repeatedly stated they had enough funding for the rest of this year when asked, and the department has reported spending less than $9 billion of the $19.6 billion that was provided last spring. Congressman Bost and I will be reviewing VA’s response and justification for this funding request to ensure any additional emergency spending is going to meet the needs of veterans during the pandemic. Our veterans and taxpayers both deserve oversight and accountability on how this emergency funding would be spent. 
  
Advancing PTSD Treatment through U.S-Israeli Collaborative Research 
I reintroduced the bipartisan United States-Israel PTSD Collaboration Research Act this week to allow the Department of Defense (DoD) to work with academic and non-profit institutions in the United States and Israel to advance research and treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  As the leading Republican on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, one of my top priorities has been improving access to mental health care for our veterans. My bill will continue these efforts by allowing the DoD to fund collaborative research efforts between American and Israeli organizations through a robust grant program. We must continue to invest in the research and development of treatments for PTSD and other mental health conditions that many of our servicemembers face when they return home from service. While the challenges associated with PTSD are great, they are not insurmountable. I have had the opportunity to witness the advancements that our nation’s medical professionals have made to care for victims of trauma, such as combat veterans, law enforcement officers and victims of violence. PTSD is a serious issue, and the lives of those touched by trauma and violence should receive proper care to help them cope and recover from this disorder. 
  
￼ 
  
Protecting Life and Defending the Unborn 
This week, I joined 47 of my Republican colleagues in a letter to Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer declaring opposition to any legislation that weakens the Hyde Amendment or other pro-life protections. Since it was enacted in 1976, this amendment bars the use of federal funds to pay for abortion except in certain circumstances. For decades, this provision has enjoyed strong bipartisan support, including then-Senator Joe Biden, reflecting the majority of Americans who do not believe tax dollars should be used in this way. Senator Schumer should maintain this sensible, longstanding language.  I will continue to use my role in Congress to further the cause of life and defend the unborn.

Visiting with BNSF President Katie Farmer 
I met virtually with Katie Farmer, the new President and CEO of the Burlington Northern Santa Fe (BNSF) Railway, this week. Succeeding Mr. Carl Ice, Ms. Farmer has been with BNSF for almost thirty years, and I enjoyed the chance to discuss her priorities for the industry and how I can be of assistance in the months ahead. BNSF is the largest railroad network in North America, moves 30% of the nation’s rail freight and is an incredible asset to the state of Kansas. I enjoyed working with Mr. Ice over the years, and I look forward to working with Ms. Farmer in her effort supporting policies that continue to promote railway safety, innovation and efficiencies within the industry as she takes on this new role. 
  
Meeting Major General Sims at Fort Riley 
This weekend, I met with the Commanding General of Fort Riley, Major General Sims on base. MG Sims assumed command of Fort Riley last year and I was pleased to get to know him better during our visit. I have been a long-time advocate for Big Red One soldiers, and I am looking forward to working with MG Sims to make certain they have the resources they need to keep our nation safe.

Dear Lindsey Cormack,
Today, the Senate begins the second impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump for his role inciting the insurrection on January 6th, 2021 at the United States Capitol. 
Yesterday afternoon, I hosted a conversation with Walter Dellinger, the former Solicitor General under President Clinton and an impeachment expert, to preview the Senate trial and answer your questions. In case you missed it, I encourage you to watch the recording on my Facebook page or my website.
The House impeached President Trump on January 13th, 2021. Now, the Senate must determine whether to convict him and, separately, prohibit him from ever holding federal public office again. Live coverage of the trial will be streamed online and on television every day on C-Span.
I want to hear from you: Do you think the Senate should convict former President Donald Trump for inciting an insurrection at the Capitol on January 6th, 2021? Do you think the Senate should permanently bar Donald Trump from holding federal public office? Share your thoughts with me by completing my survey. 
Sincerely, 
￼
David Price

District Swearing In Ceremony
 
It is the honor of a lifetime to serve as your representative in Congress. On January 28th, I had the pleasure of reaffirming my oath to the Constitution and to the constituents of Texas’ 11th District before God, family, and the kind, honest, hard-working people that make our West Texas region so special.

￼
￼

Congressman Pfluger, joined by wife Camille, is sworn in by U.S. District Judge David Counts during a ceremony at the U.S. Courthouse in Midland on January 28th, 2021

I do not take this oath lightly. As a seventh-generation Texan born and raised in this District in a family whose livelihoods depended on agriculture and oil and gas, I understand that the policies coming out of Washington are more than just economics and industries—they are personal.

As I have said many times, the 11th District of Texas is special. It is a critical intersection of national security for our country. Home to the largest oil and gas producing region in the Nation, over 15 million acres of farm and ranch land, multiple premiere universities—both public and private—and a world-class Air Force Base that trains service members from every branch of our military in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, as well as specialized firefighting techniques. Our district also plays a key role in border security and many other critical operations. 

But more than contributing Energy, Agriculture, and National Security, our District is made up of some of the best people in the world who truly care for their neighbor, community, and country. I have my work cut out for me going up against policies in Washington that seek to undercut conservative values and overblow the scope of federal government control, but I pledge to continue standing up for Texas values and for the people and livelihoods here at home.

Read on to see the work I have been doing for you in Congress:

Appointed to Two Major National Security Committees
 
I am honored and excited to represent the 11th District of Texas on two fantastic committees tasked with defending the security of our nation at home and abroad—the House Committee on Homeland Security and House Foreign Affairs Committee. I have also been appointed as the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Intelligence and Counterterrorism on the Homeland Security Committee. 

The most important role of the federal government is to protect our citizens from national security threats. Both of these committees will allow our district to have a seat at the table regarding immigration and border security, counterterrorism, cyber security, energy, and international trade, and advancing America’s position against global threats like China, Russia, Iran and other rogue actors. 

I look forward to working with my colleagues on these committees to ensure the United States remains the safest, most prosperous nation in the world. Click here to read more. 

Leading the Texas Ag Task Force

Last week, I was announced as a co-leader of the Texas Ag Task Force, which will promote and champion federal policies in Congress that strengthen Texas agriculture and rural communities.

The 11th District has over 15 million acres of farm and ranch land worked by diligent producers who provide not only this district, but the entire Nation, with the food and fiber we need to survive. I am excited to lead this task force with several of my colleagues and ensure that Texans present a strong, united voice as we advocate for the hundreds of thousands of hard-working farmers and ranchers in the Lone Star State.

￼

Supporting Meaningful Legislation

Over these last few weeks, I supported numerous bills that further the best interests of the 11th District and our entire nation.

Conservation Funding Protection Act
Sponsored by Dan Crenshaw (TX-2)
This legislation ensures that oil producers will retain access to critical energy reservoirs on the Outer Continental Shelf by addressing President Biden’s harmful executive order that jeopardizes our critical energy production.

Restricting Federal Funding to Organizations Associated with the Abortion Industry
Sponsored by Rep. Virginia Foxx (NC-5)
This bill works to prohibit taxpayer dollars from funding abortions or entities that provide abortions.

Authorizing the Keystone XL Pipeline
Sponsored by Rep. Kelly Armstrong (ND-00)
This bill authorizes the construction and operation of the Keystone XL Pipeline and declares that a Presidential permit is not required. 

Home in the 11th District

Last week, I had the honor of meeting some of the healthcare professionals, law enforcement agents, farmers, business owners, and community leaders who are making a huge impact in our district.  

Read some of my reflections on the good work being done in District 11 in my article in the Midland Reporter-Telegram. 
￼

Angelo State University is a special asset to the Concho Valley. It was an honor to meet with ASU President Ronnie Hawkins Jr. in San Angelo. During the meeting, President Hawkins outlined the university’s plans to establish a Center of Excellence in Cybersecurity and Artificial Intelligence through a partnership with Goodfellow Air Force Base, the local community, and existing industry relationships.

It is impressive to see the continued enrollment growth of the student body and hear about the great work underway to educate the next generation of leaders in a variety of industries, including intelligence. I look forward to partnering with President Hawkins and the Ram Family to support their mission and work towards the good of the San Angelo Community.

Meeting with officers stationed at the Border Patrol Station in San Angelo. These officers bolster our National security by operating unmanned aircraft over 850 miles of the border between Texas and Mexico.
￼

Paying a visit to the students, faculty, and health professionals at the Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center Permian Basin, who are reaching across university lines to advance telemedicine access in rural communities in West Texas.

￼

Visiting the COVID-19 vaccination site at the Midland County Horseshoe and meeting some of the healthcare volunteers from Midland College.
￼

Meeting with business owners and community leaders at a meeting with the Midland Chamber of Commerce.
￼

Touring farms and ranches in the 11th District with the Texas Farm Bureau. 

We Don’t Need Bailouts, We Need to Get Back to Work

I spoke on the House Floor for the first time in opposition to Budget Reconciliation, a partisan resolution that sets the stage to jam through President Biden’s COVID stimulus bill that will cost nearly $2 trillion, and includes a liberal wish list of provisions unrelated to the pandemic.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
February 5, 2021
VIDEO: Risch Staff Honors U.S. Capitol Police for Their Service   
BOISE, Idaho – Following the events that transpired at the United States Capitol on January 6 th, U.S. Senator Jim Risch’s (R-Idaho) staff organized a thank-you drive for U.S. Capitol Police. Over the course of one week, Risch staffers collected hundreds of thank you notes and treats from concerned Americans and Capitol Hill offices alike. Staffers in the Risch office then assembled the gift bags and thank you notes and delivered them to U.S. Capitol Police.
“Over the past few weeks, my staff assembled care packages and collected hundreds of messages for the United States Capitol Police force thanking them for their service to our democracy and our country,” said Risch. “This would not have been possible without the efforts of my scheduling team, Alexa Green and Mercedes Erikson, and the many other staff members who contributed to this operation. I am proud of each and every one of my staff.”

2/9/21 10:19,Weekly Update:  COVID Relief Legislation Should Be Bipartisan,"

Weekly Update | February 6, 2021
￼

COVID Relief Legislation Should Be Bipartisan

President Biden campaigned on bipartisanship and pledged to lead the country in a unifying way. This latest round of discussions on additional COVID-19 relief will be the president’s first major opportunity to show the American people if he was telling the truth about how he would lead and govern. I know we will have policy disagreements on how to get the country through this pandemic, but as a conservative committed to governing, I believe both parties have an obligation to our constituents to work together and find common ground.

That is why I, and a group of Republican colleagues in the House, sent a letter to President Biden this week urging him to reject efforts to pass a Democrat-only COVID-19 relief plan, and pursue a bipartisan agreement. 

Part of our letter stated, “Bipartisanship is not only essential to delivering an effective response to the pandemic, but to demonstrating our shared commitment to unifying the American people and forging the pathway forward together. With this in mind, we urge your Administration to work with leaders and Members of both parties to advance a bipartisan COVID-19 relief package comprised of consensus-driven policies.” 

Since March, Congress has enacted five bipartisan COVID-19 relief packages developed with bipartisan, bicameral cooperation. Despite strong support now on both sides of the aisle for an additional pandemic relief package that includes funds to strengthen national vaccination and testing programs, immediate assistance to individuals and families, and expanded support for struggling businesses, Democratic Leaders in Congress have signaled they intend to forgo meaningful bipartisan negotiations, resorting instead to the partisan budget reconciliation process. This tool allows spending legislation, such as COVID-19 relief, to be enacted without bipartisan support. 

You can read the full letter here.

Meeting with National Guard Leaders
￼

Pictured above: Rodney greets members of the National Guard from Illinois

This week, I met with leaders of the National Guard providing support to the U.S. Capitol Police, including Major General William Walker, Commanding General for the District Columbia of National Guard, Brigadier General John Driscoll, Task Force Capitol Grounds Commander, and other members of the National Guard.

As last month's events remain fresh on the minds of members, staff, and the American people, we are so grateful to have members of the National Guard assisting the United States Capitol Police continue to secure the Capitol complex. We know the National Guard was ready to immediately assist as rioters approached the Capitol on January 6th, but there was a clear breakdown in the approval process. This failure is just one of the reasons I've called for immediate public hearings to address security operations and for Congress to establish a 9/11-style commission to prevent this from ever happening again. We must understand where the breakdown happened, take steps so this never happens again, and hold anyone responsible for this delay accountable.

Expanding Registered Apprenticeship Programs

This week, I voted in support of the National Apprenticeship Act, which seeks to create nearly 1 million additional apprenticeship opportunities over the next five years.

Registered Apprenticeships are a successful, proven federal workforce training program that creates new, good-paying jobs. That is why I proudly voted in support of this bill. This bipartisan legislation will create nearly 1 million new apprenticeships over the coming years and will offer out-of-work Americans new job opportunities in this struggling economy. We should be doing everything we can to get our economy going again, and that starts by building on what works and enacting job-creating policies.

Grant Awarded to Heritage Behavior Health Center in Decatur

This week, our office announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded a $4,000,000 Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinic (CCBHC) Expansion Grant to Heritage Behavior Health Center in Decatur. The grant will enable them to become a federally designated CCBHC allowing them to expand their services to integrate primary care alongside critical behavioral health services.

I congratulate Heritage Behavior Health Center on receiving this multi-million dollar federal grant that will allow them to expand their already wide-array of services to the community. It will ensure that those who need access to mental health and substance use disorder treatment will be able to receive it alongside primary health care services. This is a great example of the kind of investments the federal government is making to improve access to care and I’m proud to support it. I've visited Heritage multiple times during my time in Congress and know that they'll put the funding to good use for Decatur and the surrounding communities.

Remembering the Life of Rosemarie Long
￼

I was saddened to learn of the passing of my good friend Rosemarie Long, leader of the Sangamon County Republicans, this week. Rose was a mentor to me and so many others in Sangamon County. She cared deeply about her community and will be sorely missed. I cannot believe she is gone. May God continue to bless her family at this sorrowful time.

I spoke on the House floor to remember the life of Rose. You can watch my full remarks here.

2/9/21 12:01,Clyde in Congress: I'm fighting against Democratic Party Overreach,"

117th Congress, 1st Session | February 9th, 2021
￼


We are coming off another busy week in Congress during which Democrats pushed through a
budget resolution that paves the way for a nearly $2 trillion bail out for blue states, took
unprecedented action to remove a Republican member of the Georgia delegation from her
committees, and called for domestic terrorism legislation that I have no doubt will be used as a
political weapon against conservatives. 

Additionally, you may have seen that I was fined for refusing to comply with Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s unconstitutional directive which placed magnetometers at the entrance of the House floor, a move which effectively impedes my ability to cast my vote on your behalf. Not only do I believe this directive is unconstitutional, but it is also an additional step in the Democratic Party’s ongoing efforts to demonize Republicans by painting us as an insider threat with ultimate goal of
silencing us.

As I told Fox News’ Laura Ingraham on Friday and John Roberts on Monday, I am going to appeal
these so-called violations and will be taking the appropriate legal action. Be sure to keep an eye
out for updates on this matter in future newsletters and on my website.

Finally, I recently signed on to a resolution honoring the late Hank Aaron, one of Georgia’s most legendary sports figures. “Hammerin’ Hank” embodied both the strength and perseverance that we as Georgians value so dearly, and I am grateful to have joined my colleagues from the Georgia delegation in honoring his legacy.

As I continue to travel throughout the district over the next two weeks, I look forward to hearing your issues and trying to find ways in which I can support you in Congress.

Democrats Pass a Blank Check Resolution on COVID-19 Relief

Last week, House and Senate Democrats passed a blank check budget resolution that allows them
to craft and send to the White House a COVID-19 relief package without any support from
Republicans. Specifically, Democratic Leaders instructed certain committees in both chambers to
find nearly $2 trillion to accommodate President Biden’s “American Rescue Plan” – a plan that
does nothing more than bail out blue states and add to our nations ever-increasing deficit
spending levels.

Congress already provided $4 trillion to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic by the time I
took office, of which nearly $1.3 trillion has yet to be disbursed or committed to relief efforts.
Democrats are so eager to fulfill their radical wish list that they are willing to do so on the backs
of future generations of Americans. I voted against the Democrats’ radical blank check giveaway
and will continue to do so in the months to come as they put forward legislative initiatives to
comply with their “budget resolution.” We must work to re-open our schools, provide smart and
targeted support to small businesses that are struggling, and see to it that our first responders and
health care workers have the resources they need to protect themselves while simultaneously
helping our friends and neighbors. I plan to support efforts that do just that.

Rep. Clyde Participates in His First Committee Hearings of the 117th Congress and Conducts Oversight of President Biden’s immigration Executive Orders 

Last week, I was able to participate in the first committee hearing of my tenure. The House Homeland Security Committee held a hearing that examined issues pertaining to domestic terrorism and the role violent extremists played in the January 6th riots on the U.S. Capitol. I was proud to participate and found the hearing to be informative, but very one sided toward creating more laws in the name of domestic terrorism. This was very concerning to me. These new proposals include a type of political litmus test in order for citizens to serve in positions of authority like the Armed Forces, law enforcement, public servants at every level, and even elected officials - a litmus test that no doubt would ultimately be used as a political weapon. I look forward to working with my colleagues to strengthen our nation’s security while always preserving our constitutional rights.

In addition, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform held its first hearing. This hearing
reviewed the Department of Justice Inspector General’s report on the Trump Administration’s
immigrant child separation policy, also referred to as the “Zero Tolerance Policy.” This partisan
hearing was nothing more than an attempt to try and manipulate the public into supporting
President Biden’s far left immigration agenda. Moreover, the Democratic-run hearing failed to
acknowledge that the Trump administration made significant progress in addressing the
humanitarian and security concerns that plagued our southern border.

We cannot allow the radical left to continue to distort the truth to push policies that will grant
amnesty to thousands of people who knowingly broke the law by crossing the border illegally. In
no way do these policies benefit American citizens.

For that very reason, I joined my Oversight Committee Republican colleagues in sending a letter
to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, to express our
shared concerns about the ramifications of President Biden’s unilateral actions taken to date on
immigration.

We must understand how these actions will impact the operations at our border, protect our
citizens and use tax dollars wisely, so my colleagues and I requested a briefing with Secretary
Mayorkas to better understand the Biden Administration’s agenda on this matter. In addition, we
have requested the following documentation:

1. All documents and communications related to President Biden’s decision to halt
construction of the border wall for 60 days.

2. All documents and communications related to the $1.3 billion in funds specifically
appropriated for construction of the border wall including but not limited to any repurposing of
these funds.

3. All documents and communications related to the Department of Homeland Security’s
plan to ensure effective border security and safety of Americans living in border regions,
particularly in those areas where construction of physical barriers was halted, including what
additional resources will be necessary due to the halt in construction.

4. All documents sufficient to show a full accounting of funds appropriated to the
Department of Homeland Security for the “construction of barrier system along the southwest
border” for FY2018, FY2019, FY2020, and FY2021, including funds obligated, where and how
they were obligated, and what appropriated money remains to be obligated.

5. All documents and communications from January 20, 2021 to present related to any of
the following along the southwestern border: a) increased illegal entries, b) drug trafficking, c)
firearms trafficking, and d) violent incidents involving American citizens.

The safety of every U.S. citizen is paramount, and I remain committed to supporting the
construction of border walls and the enforcement of sound immigration policies.

This Week in Washington D.C.
 
￼
 
WASHINGTON D.C. - Last Tuesday was Groundhog Day, and much like the movie, it seems we are truly living the same day over and over again in Washington D.C., as there were more Democratic power grabs and attempts to silence and expel conservative members of Congress.
 
In case you missed it, Punxsutawney Phil saw his shadow and, as legend holds, that means six more weeks of winter.
 
 
 
CENSORED!
 
￼
 Stripping Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Committee Assignments:
In an unprecedented power grab, House Democrats attempted to silence Georgia Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene by unanimously voting to strip her of her important committee assignments for comments she made before becoming a member of Congress. 
 
Instead of allowing the House Ethics Committee to conduct a proper investigation, Democrats chose to bypass rules and procedures by expelling Congresswoman Taylor Greene from her committees. This rare move is a new low point for House Democrats. All Americans are guaranteed the right to exercise freedom of speech without fear of punishment or reprisal. Sadly, the cancel culture is very much alive in the halls of Congress. 
 
 
 
Ruling By Decree
 
￼
 
Unprecedented Flurry of Executive Orders:
In October 2020, then presidential candidate Joe Biden, during an NBC town hall, had this to say about the use of executive orders to bypass Congress and the will of the American people: “there are certain things you can’t do by executive order unless you’re a dictator. We are a Democracy, we need consensus,” he concluded.
 
I don’t often agree with Joe Biden, but candidate Joe Biden was absolutely right.  I didn’t support previous presidential use of executive orders and I don’t support them now. Unfortunately, candidate Joe Biden then is at odds with President Joe Biden now.  Since being sworn in on January 20th, Mr. Biden has signed a flurry of directives, using executive actions 48 times during his first few weeks in office.  According to the Washington Post, Mr. Biden has signed three times the number of executive orders his predecessors had at this same point in their presidencies. These executive actions have allowed Mr. Biden to enact parts of his liberal, jobs-killing socialist agenda by ignoring congressional opposition and circumventing the legislative process entirely.  Such unilateral action is a complete overreach and a power grab never envisioned by our Founding Fathers.
 
Throughout his campaign and since being sworn in, Mr. Biden has repeatedly stated he would like to work across party lines to resolve differences. Mr. Biden’s aggressive use and abuse of executive orders demonstrate something completely different.  His early reliance on using executive orders to achieve results that he knows would never get through Congress is not a prescription on how to be a consensus builder.  
 
 
 
Where I'll be Fighting for YOU
 
￼
 
117th Congress Committee Assignments:
I am honored to once again be selected to serve on the House Oversight and Reform Committee and the House Natural Resources Committee. In particular, I have long cherished my position on the Natural Resources Committee, as it provides me with a direct means to oversee U.S. policy for many issues relevant to Arizona and the West, including energy and mineral resources, national parks and lands, and our Native American Tribes. 
 
Additionally, I am pleased to announce that I will serve as the top Republican (Ranking Member) on the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, which will allow me to continue to be a leader in exposing waste, fraud, and abuse. On the House Oversight and Reform Committee, I was selected to serve on the Subcommittees on the Environment and National Security, where I will again be well-positioned to fight against open borders and misguided environmental policies that harm Arizona. I am very excited to get back to work for our district!
 
 
 
Committee on Oversight and Reform
 
￼
 
Reviewing America's Immigration Policies:
On February 4, the House Oversight and Reform Committee held a hearing about the Trump Administration’s child separation policy.
To be perfectly clear, this child separation pFolicy did not start with President Trump. Rather, it dates back to the Clinton Administration and was further exacerbated under the Obama Administration. To combat illegal immigration, President Trump took important action to enforce immigration at our borders. Once again, Democrats proved they are more obsessed with President Trump than they are with taking action. I participated in the hearing and encourage everyone to watch my remarks HERE.
The Biden Administration has announced it will weaken the strong immigration policies put in place under the Trump Administration.  As a result, I have challenged House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairwoman Maloney to hold another hearing with the proper Biden Administration officials so we can fully understand the ramifications of these new actions to weaken our immigration policies. 
 
 
Rob From the Poor and Give to the Rich?
 
￼
 
Gosar Probes Robinhood Disruption of Retail Trading:
During my time in Congress, I have worked tirelessly to exposed how a class of elites plays by one set of rules, while everyone else in America plays by another. With each passing day, power is increasingly being condensed among a powerful few and rigged against hard working Americans. This was recently put on full display when a group of “retail investors” countered the fat cats on Wall Street. Working together, these ""retail investors"" sparked a massive stock market rally, quickly raising the price of a specific stock.
 
For years, Wall Street has benefitted a few rich trading insiders.  These same insiders are now crying foul because the average investor might have made a buck or two.  To protect these Wall Street fat cats, retail investors were suddenly blocked from trading. This is very alarming and appears to be an anti-trust violation. I immediately wrote a letter to the Department of Justice asking them to investigate these anti-competitive practices.
 
You can read my letter HERE.
 
 
 
Ham Radio!
 
￼
 
Support of “National Amateur Radio Operators Day” April 18, 2021:
I am proud to announce that Arizona Congresswoman Lesko and I introduced a resolution designating April 18th as National Amateur Radio Operators Day to pay tribute to the many Amateur Radio Operators in Arizona. Amateur Radio, also known as ‘Ham’ radio, communicates using a specific frequency without the need for commercials. Ham radio has been around for generations.  In fact, many of our first responders continue to use this important system to communicate when other forms of communications become disabled. In times of disaster, communicating effectively is the most important tool we have. This resolution celebrates the great significance to our country that Amateur Radio Operators play. Thank you to our Amateur Radio Operators for preserving this wonderful tradition which continues to make our Arizona communities safe.

Senator Baldwin, a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP), and U.S. Representative Gwen Moore have introduced legislation to improve access to maternity care and grow and diversify the perinatal health workforce. The Perinatal Workforce Act establishes grant programs to increase the number of maternity care providers and non-clinical perinatal health workers who offer culturally congruent support to women throughout their pregnancies, labor and delivery, and the postpartum period. The legislation is included in the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2021 to address the United States’ urgent maternal health crisis. 
“Maternal and infant mortality rates are tragically high in Wisconsin, and they are even higher in the Black community. We need to do more to make sure women and families have access to quality, affordable health care,” said Senator Baldwin. “We know that healthier pregnancies lead to healthier babies. That’s why I’m working with my colleagues to provide more resources to expecting moms and address the challenges in our maternal health system so mothers and pregnant women can get the care they need.”  “Black women already were forced to bear the brunt of our maternal mortality crisis and now the existing inequities revealed during this pandemic only burden Black mothers even more. The Momnibus couldn’t be introduced at a more pivotal time. As part of our work to invest in the health of Black mothers, we must diversify the perinatal health care workforce to better reflect the communities they serve. Black mothers need professionals who can serve as a source of support through the birthing experience, who are culturally competent to serve our most vulnerable mothers. I am proudly joining my sisters in the Black Maternal Health Caucus along with Wisconsin’s incredible champion, Senator Tammy Baldwin, to raise the urgency of this issue. We will continue fighting in the trenches for maternal justice!” said Congresswoman Moore. 
In the last 25 years, while pregnancy-related mortality ratios fell 44 percent around the world, the American maternal mortality rate increased: moms are now more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes in the United States than in any other high-income country in the world. The situation is even worse for Black women, who are three to four times more likely to die from giving birth than their white counterparts. While the causes of the crisis are complex, one driving force is a lack of access to maternity care, and to culturally congruent maternity care and support specifically. More than one-third of U.S. counties are “maternity care deserts,” with no hospitals offering obstetric care and zero obstetric providers. Maternity care access is limited in both rural and urban communities: more than one million American women live in maternity care deserts located in large metropolitan areas or urban settings.  Specifically, the Perinatal Workforce Act will: 
	•	Require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to (1) provide guidance to states on the promotion of racially, ethnically, and professionally diverse maternity care teams and (2) to study how culturally congruent maternity care promotes better outcomes for moms, especially in communities of color.
	•	Provide funding to establish and scale programs that will grow and diversify the maternal health workforce, increasing the number of nurses, physician assistants, and other perinatal health workers who moms can trust throughout their pregnancies, labor and delivery, and the postpartum period.
	•	Study the barriers that prevent women – particularly from underserved communities – from entering maternity care professions and receiving equitable compensation.
In Wisconsin, the Perinatal Workforce Act is supported by the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health, UW-Health System, United Way of Dane County, Wisconsin Alliance for Women's Health, Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin, Planned Parenthood Wisconsin, Birthing Project USA of Southeast Wisconsin, Kids Forward, SSM Health, The Foundation for Black Women’s Wellness, and Black Leaders Organizing for Communities (BLOC). Over 160 national organizations have also endorsed this legislation.  Read more about Senator Baldwin’s Perinatal Workforce Act and the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2021 here.

ICYMI: Bergman Supports Protections for Pre-Existing Conditions

Washington - Last week, Rep. Jack Bergman joined the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Ranking Member, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, in introducing H.R. 892, the Pre-Existing Conditions Protection Act of 2021 – a bill to guarantee protections for patients with pre-existing conditions.
This legislation would ensure three key protections for those with pre-existing conditions: guaranteed access to health insurance coverage, a ban on limiting or denying employee benefits, and a prohibition on raising premiums based on pre-existing conditions. By specifically outlining these protections, H.R. 892 would help create a strong foundation for future health reform legislation.
Following the bill’s introduction, Rep. Bergman said: “Promoting access to affordable, quality healthcare has been one of my biggest priorities in Congress. Whether it’s expanding coverage for telehealth services, banning surprise medical billing, or providing emergency funding to health providers during the COVID-19 pandemic, I have worked to be a voice for Michigan patients and providers. While this is only one part of our efforts to create an effective health care system for all Americans, I am proud to join in support of this continued commitment to ensure protections for pre-existing conditions are upheld for future generations.”
H.R. 892 is also designed so these important safeguards would be protected even if future legislation or court decisions alter provisions under the Affordable Care Act. To view the bill in its entirety, click HERE.

Beatty Boosts Bill Cutting Taxes for Families with Children Congresswoman Beatty cosponsors the American Family Act
U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) is joining forces with a group of leading Members of Congress and Senators to reintroduce the American Family Act of 2021, a measure to overhaul and strengthen the Child Tax Credit (CTC) to provide families with children the much-needed financial resources to weather COVID-19’s financial storm. Based on research from the Columbia University Center on Poverty and Social Policy, the American Family Act would cut child poverty by 38 percent.
“Too many parents in Ohio’s Third Congressional District and beyond are struggling to make ends meet because of the COVID-19 Pandemic,” Beatty said. “Even worse, the virus has drastically deepened economic inequalities, leaving tens of millions of families—many of whom are Black families—unable to put food on the table, pay their bills, and keep a roof over their heads.” She added, “The American Family Act will not only help hardworking families buy groceries, afford rent, and purchase the essentials they need, but the bill will also raise millions out of poverty in the long-term.” 
If enacted, the American Family Act would:
	•	Increase CTC to $3,000 per child and $3,600 for a child under six;
	•	make the payments monthly ($250 and $300 for children under six);
	•	authorize the credit to be fully refundable, helping the one-third of families left out of the credit now to access the full benefit; 
	•	and allow 17-year-olds to be eligible.

Backing America's Energy Producers
￼
￼
￼
￼
The world's demand for energy is growing. That's a good thing. However, the question remains: Who is going to meet that demand? The answer should be America's energy producers. We have a strong energy sector that is built on American businesses. We must continue to support them as they protect our national security interests while countries like Russia and Iran compete against us on the world stage.

Strengthening our energy standing is also about the American worker. Now is not the time to cut good-paying jobs and raise energy prices.

Last week, I spoke alongside Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, Congressman Kevin Brady, and others at the Port of Houston about why the Biden Administration's recent energy policies are harmful to the State of Texas and the nation. You can watch my remarks HERE.

Just the News Interview: The Water Cooler with David Brody

￼
I joined The Water Cooler to explain my bill, the Women's Public Health and Safety Act, which would help prevent taxpayer dollars from funding abortion providers. I recently reintroduced this legislation with Sen. James Lankford (R-OK) in order to give states the authority to exclude abortion providers, like Planned Parenthood, from receiving Medicaid funds. You can read more about the bill in my op-ed HERE.  

We also discussed the Biden Administration's harmful energy policies and plans for an additional COVID stimulus bill. You can watch the full interview HERE.

I was grateful for the recent opportunity to speak at the Corpus Christi Right to Life Apologetics conference. 
I delivered a legislative update to this group that represents part of the pro-life movement in Corpus Christi, sharing with them the ways our office is influencing pro-life legislation in Congress. I got my start in grassroots, so I know how effective grassroots groups can be for influencing federal and even global policy. I appreciate citizens actively involving themselves in protecting life.

The right to life is essential, God-given, and inalienable. Congress should do everything it can to protect the preborn.

$3 Million Grant to Port of Victoria

I'm excited to announce that the Economic Development Administration (EDA) awarded a $3 million grant to the Port of Victoria. This grant will allow the Port to construct a 1.9-mile rail loop and a 2,000-foot ladder track to serve existing and future port customers. In turn, this will help the region’s economic resiliency and growth as the Port of Victoria expands. 

Texas railways and infrastructure are vital to our state’s and nation’s economic success, and I’m glad to call this grant a victory for our part of South Texas. By expanding its rail operating capacity and creating new jobs, the Port of Victoria will continue to be a major contributor to economic recovery and growth for the Crossroads area and the State of Texas.

The Port of Victoria’s rail project will be vital to our region as we continue to recover from the past few years’ hurricanes and COVID-19. I was glad to write a letter of support for the funding to the EDA last year. Additionally, my office has staff dedicated to assisting communities, schools, businesses, and families as they seek federal funding, and if we can help, we want to hear about it.

COVID Vaccine Update

Beginning in January, Texas established large vaccination sites or hubs around the state. The goal of these hubs is to provide more people the vaccine and a simpler way to sign up for an appointment. Providers will focus on vaccinating areas and populations hardest hit by COVID‑19. Phase 1A and 1B individuals are eligible to receive a vaccine at these hubs, regardless of where they reside. 
	•	Phase 1A: Front-line healthcare workers and residents at long-term care facilities.  
	•	Phase 1B: People over 65 or with a chronic medical condition that puts them at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. 

In our district, there are currently three hubs:
	•	Bastrop County: A+ Life Style Medical Group. Call (866) 268-2289. 
	•	Neuces County: Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District. Call (361) 826-7200, option 2. Driscoll Health System is partnering with them. 
	•	Victoria County: Victoria County Public Health Department. Call (361) 578-6281. 

The state also has created the Texas COVID-19 Vaccine Availability Map that you can use to see which providers have the vaccine and contact them to get scheduled. 
￼

In Other News:

	•	President Abraham Lincoln once said, “Be sure you put your feet in the right place, then stand firm.”  He served our country at its most divided point in history, where identity and relationships were determined by which side someone was on - a time very similar to what we are seeing now. President Lincoln encouraged people not to seek if God was on their “side,” but to seek God’s side, because “God is always right.”  We should take the wisdom of one of the United States’ greatest presidents by seeking truth and standing firm in that truth, especially as we honor his birthday on February 12th. 

	•	Do you know a teen who has a passion for leadership preparedness? FEMA is accepting applications for its 2021 Youth Preparedness Council. Since 2012, FEMA has brought together young leaders who are interested in supporting disaster preparedness and making a difference in their communities by completing disaster preparedness projects nationally and locally. The application period is open to teens in grades 8-11 till 11:59 p.m. PT on March 7th. Selected candidates will be notified in May 2021. Interested students may apply online HERE. For more information about the Youth Preparedness Council or other youth-focused preparedness initiatives, contact us at FEMA-Prepare@fema.dhs.gov.

 Thought of the day: “When we give cheerfully and accept gratefully, everyone is blessed.” – Maya Angelou
Coronavirus Update

On Monday, Michigan reported 1,769 new cases of COVID-19 and 11 new deaths, bringing the state’s total cases to 569,417 and deaths to 14,905. Michigan’s positivity rate has dropped to 5.7%, a hopeful direction after the recent surge in cases that started in November. As COVID numbers across much of the country trend in a more hopeful direction, experts are warning states and individuals not to let their guard down just yet. Now is the time for us to double down on wearing masks, keeping our physical, and washing our hands so we can keep lowering these numbers and slowing spread, especially with the new variants of the virus that have been discovered throughout Michigan.
On Monday, Michigan reported 2,022,250 COVID vaccines have been distributed and, of that, 1,292,572 vaccines have been administered. Currently, Michigan is prioritizing available vaccines for those 65 and older, front-line workers, some state and federal workers, jail and prison staff, Pre-K through 12th-grade teachers, and childcare providers. Michigan is working hard to get vaccines into as many arms as possible, as quickly as possible. The vaccine rollout hasn’t been perfect, but the Biden Administration is hard at work to speed up the delivery and administration of vaccines.
On the COVID relief front, Congress is moving with urgency to pass President Biden’s American Rescue Plan. This week, the House and Senate are working to put pen to paper, putting President Biden’s plan into a comprehensive relief package to support families and individuals, aid small businesses, and build back our economy.
Lots of progress has already been made on the relief package, with senior democrats agreeing to include $1,400 direct payments to individuals earning up to $75,000 per year, and couples earning up to $150,000 per year. Among other components of the relief package being discussed is a new child tax credit that would offer $3,600 per child under 6 over the course of a year, as well as $3,000 per child 6 to 17. The relief package in its current form would also extend federal unemployment benefits that are set to expire mid-March, through the end of August, and increase the benefit from $300 a week to $400. In a hard fight, democratic leadership has also secured an increase of the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, a win that will lift millions of Americans out of poverty, if signed into law.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is aiming to have the COVID relief package on the floor for a vote by next week. We are working hard to get this relief package done as quickly as possible, because we have got to speed aid to struggling Americans and small businesses. It’ll be tough to get done, but it’s our job and we have got to do it.
COVID-19 Town Hall

On Wednesday, February 10th at 7:00 P.M. EST, join me for a town hall discussion on vaccine skepticism among communities of color and what we can do to increase American’s confidence in the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines.
JOIN THE LIVESTREAM
I will be joined by Michigan Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist II, Michigan Senator Jeff Irwin, Michigan Reps. Felicia Brabec (Pittsfield) and Ronnie Peterson (Ypsilanti), and Charles Wilson with the Washtenaw County Health Department for this very important virtual discussion.
 Legislative Update
This week in Congress, we are working hard in committee to address the needs of the American people and crush COVID. We will be focused entirely on putting President Biden’s American Rescue Plan into a comprehensive relief package that can be signed into law quickly. My House Energy and Commerce Committee will meet this week to work on parts of the package within our jurisdiction. You can follow our work this week by visiting the House Energy and Commerce website.
Today, the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump will begin. We are in some truly challenging and dividing times in our country, but we cannot forget the significance of what occurred on January 6th, and we must ensure those responsible for the violent events are held to account. I encourage you to follow the trial this week to hear the arguments for yourself.

We Are Here To Serve You

￼

Read Congressman Jake LaTurner's latest op-ed on the important constituent services offered by his office:

As the proud representative of the 2nd Congressional District of Kansas, I am fully committed to serving the needs of all my constituents. Whether you voted for me or not, I am here to serve you – I pledge that I will always be a constituent-first Congressman. In addition to working on passing legislation, my priority and representational duty is to provide constituent services.

Constituent services are near and dear to my heart. I began my career in public service proudly working as a District Representative for former Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins where I was able to work directly with constituents and address their concerns. That rewarding experience instilled a deep appreciation for how significant of an impact congressional offices can make when they actively support the communities they represent. I will draw on those lessons throughout my time in office to guarantee my constituents are receiving the best possible representation.

To address constituent issues directly, we are rolling out a comprehensive mobile office hours schedule to help meet the needs of our constituents across the entire District. These mobile hours will increase accessibility and help deliver on the important work our team is doing. Moving forward, we will visit every county in the District at least once per month.

Countless Kansans deal with federal agencies on any given day. If you’re struggling to get an answer from a federal agency in a timely fashion, or if you feel you have been treated unfairly, our office may be able to help resolve a problem or get you the information you need. Common reasons for reaching out are to seek information about the federal government, obtain a missing record, assist with immigration matters, or ask questions related to passport processing, social security applications, veteran issues, or other federal benefits. Constituent benefits for my congressional office include grant assistance, educational internship opportunities, K-12 student art competition participation, and aid with Washington D.C. visits, flag requests and U.S. Service Academy nominations. We will always do our absolute best to ensure you receive a fair and efficient response to your problem. 

We have two district offices located in Topeka and Pittsburg, KS. Our Topeka District Office is located at 3550 SW 5th Street and can be reached by phone at (785) 205-5253.

ICYMI: Senate Pro-Life Caucus Chairman Rails Against Biden Abortion Executive Orders
FOX News
By: Tyler Olson, 1/28/2021
 
Sen. Steve Daines, the founder and chairman of the Senate Pro-life Caucus, slammed President Biden over his executive actions to roll back two Trump policies that restricted government support for abortion.
Specifically, Biden will issue a presidential memorandum that will rescind the Mexico City Policy, which prevents the federal government from funding international organizations that provide abortion.
In a similar move, Biden's memorandum will direct the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to reconsider Trump-era regulations that require separation between family planning programs funded under Title X and abortion. This includes the actual performance of abortions, referrals for abortions and financial connections to abortion-related activities. 
""President Biden’s decision to reverse critical pro-life policies at home and abroad shows a complete lack of respect for the sanctity of human life,"" Daines, R-Mont., said in a comment given to Fox News. ""These actions will enrich Planned Parenthood and the abortion industry at the taxpayers’ expense, while endangering the most vulnerable. The United States should not be promoting a radical abortion agenda throughout the world, we should be leading the fight to protect the unborn and all life.""
The White House Thursday morning said, ""for President Biden, this is personal."" The actions, it said in a fact sheet, will ""protect access to reproductive health care.""
Daines, meanwhile, said he is introducing a bill that would ban the abortion of babies because they are diagnosed to have Down syndrome before they are born. 
""Tomorrow is the 48th annual March for Life. Although this year’s March will be primarily virtual, the importance of standing together to protect the unborn, the most vulnerable, and all life is as important now as it has ever been,"" Daines said. 
""I believe every human being is created with God-given dignity and potential. No Court, no legislature, no law, can take that away,"" he continued. ""Nevertheless, today, babies with Down syndrome are the most endangered on Earth... That’s why I am joining my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, in introducing the 'Protecting Individuals with Down Syndrome Act'"" which will prohibit abortions that are sought because of a diagnosis that an unborn child has or may have Down syndrome.""
Daines recounted his experience with a friend's son, who he said was named Andrew, saying the boy is ""a true joy and his family celebrates his life every day."" But, he said, 67% of babies diagnosed with Down syndrome are aborted... In Europe, the numbers are even worse.""
The penalty for a doctor knowingly performing an abortion due to a Down syndrome diagnosis in Daines' bill would be up to five years in prison. 
""It is our duty to protect every innocent life, no matter how small, no matter how many chromosomes they may have,"" Daines said Wednesday.

Sen. Rick Scott Votes Against Dems’ $2 Trillion Spending Package That Hurts American Families 
Last week, Senator Rick Scott voted against Senate Democrats’ partisan $2 trillion spending bill that increases America’s crushing national debt and does more to advance wasteful liberal priorities than actually help American families and small businesses. He will continue fighting for targeted relief for Americans and against these reckless proposals.  See more in Senator Scott’s statement HERE and in his interview with Shannon Bream on Fox News HERE or below.

Sen. Rick Scott to OMB: Taxpayers Need Transparency on $4.5 Trillion Allocated for COVID Relief 
Earlier this month, Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to the Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requesting an update on the more than $4.5 trillion in tax dollars that has been already allocated to provide financial support to individuals and businesses affected by the COVID-19 crisis. As Congress considers additional COVID-19 relief, Senator Scott is asking that all available information is released regarding tax dollar allocations and spending to make the best decisions for how to move the nation forward.  Read the Senator’s letter HERE. 
 
Sen. Rick Scott on Biden COVID-19 Spending Package: Families Need Targeted Relief, Not Blue-State Bailouts and Wasteful Liberal Priorities 
Last month, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following President-elect Biden’s announcement of his proposed $1.9 trillion COVID-19 spending package.
Senator Rick Scott said, “We have to get serious about how we’re spending taxpayer dollars. Biden wants to spend more than $350 billion to bailout wasteful states. I’ve been clear – asking taxpayers to bailout failed politicians in liberal states like New York and Illinois and save them from their own bad decisions isn’t fair to fiscally responsible states like Florida. It makes no sense. Congress has already allocated more than $4.5 trillion to address this crisis. We still don’t know how much money is unspent from previous coronavirus relief packages; including the nearly $1 trillion package that was passed just three weeks ago. We cannot simply throw massive spending at this with no accountability to the current and future American taxpayer. I will continue fighting for targeted relief that provides needed assistance to Americans hit hardest by this pandemic; but I will not stand by and let failed liberal policies be used to mortgage our kids and grandkids futures.""

Sen. Rick Scott: Democrats’ Partisan Plan to Spend Trillions Hurts American Families 
Last week, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement condemning Democrats for outright rejecting bipartisanship and using the budget reconciliation process to pass a $2 trillion spending bill that increases America’s crushing national debt and does more to advance wasteful liberal priorities than actually help American families and small businesses.  Senator Rick Scott said, “Congress is as dysfunctional as ever. Democrats only lasted 10 days before they completely rejected bipartisanship and began their one-sided push for a $2 trillion spending bill. Democrats have moved forward with a wasteful spending bill that would increase our already massive national debt, trigger devastating cuts to Medicare, and hurt the poorest families in our nation the most. Only in Washington does that make sense. So much for the Left’s call for unity.  ""While the process the Democrats have chosen makes absolutely no sense and ultimately hurts American families, I will never stop fighting for Floridians. I am filing a number of amendments to the budget to rein in Washington’s out-of-control spending, protect Americans, secure the border, and get our children back to school.""

Sen. Scott on Fox News: Biden COVID bill ‘makes no sense,’ just a ‘payback to the liberal left’ 
Last month, Senator Rick Scott joined Fox News to discuss Democrats’ plans to use the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 spending package to bailout wasteful states, like New York, Illinois and California, that want to use taxpayer money to backfill their poorly-managed budgets and pension plans. 
Senator Rick Scott said, “Senate Republicans are all in for getting targeted relief to Americans that are still hurting from this pandemic. But President Biden and the Democrats want to spend more than $350 billion to bailout their friends in New York, Illinois, and California. And they are lying about the need for this money. Congress has already given states roughly $400 billion to combat this crisis. States across the country are seeing increases in revenue — in some cases, well above projections. Now, we are learning that 47 states show an average decline of just 0.12 percent compared to 2019, and twenty-one of the 47 states show positive year over year growth of tax receipts. Over half of states reported positive growth, including California, New York, and Illinois.""

Sen. Rick Scott in the Wall Street Journal: Biden’s COVID Spending Plan is Filled with Wasteful, Liberal Priorities 
Last month, Senator Rick Scott wrote a letter to the editor of the Wall Street Journal in response to a recent editorial, “Biden’s First Spending Blowout” on President Biden’s massive $1.9 trillion COVID spending package, which includes wasteful and unnecessary spending provisions, like billions to bailout liberal states.   In the letter, Senator Rick Scott wrote, “…I agree that more must be done to support those whose livelihoods have been ripped apart due to the pandemic, but President Biden’s proposal goes far beyond that. His plan is filled with progressive pipe dreams and wasteful spending. We ought to be working on solutions that provide targeted relief and deal directly with the horrific economic and health impact of Covid-19. Unfortunately, his plan is more focused on using the pandemic to push harmful liberal priorities.…""  Read the full letter to the editor in the Wall Street Journal HERE.

The Hastings Monthly Report
February 2020

Dear Friend,
We enter the new 117th Congress welcoming a new administration. President Biden and Vice President Harris will unite the country and build it back better for all Americans. They will work to aggressively combat the COVID-19 pandemic and help our economy recover, advancing justice for all and ensure that no one is left behind.
This February we commemorate Black History Month, honoring the history of Black Americans. From emancipation to the Civil Rights Movement, the journey of the Black community exemplifies perseverance and triumph. However, the fight for equality and justice is far from over. Sadly, disparities in employment, wealth, and education still exist among communities of color across our nation, which has only been exasperated with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.  I applaud President Biden and his administration on taking action for advancing racial equality for those who have been underserved and left behind. As we celebrate this Black History Month and throughout the year, we must continue this fight together for racial equality and justice.
Legislation in Focus: Ensuring House Membership Mirrors the Citizens it Represents
On February 8th, I introduced the Congress Commission Act of 2021, which would establish a bipartisan Congressional Commission to Strengthen Representative Democracy. My legislation will mandate such a commission to solemnly examine representation in the people’s House and offer recommendations to report any shortcomings. We have not addressed House membership in over a century, despite a growing population and an overwhelming amount of evidence illustrating the need for reform of the House of Representatives. This past year, Americans from coast to coast demanded change and turned out at the polls in record numbers. It is high time we examine representation to ensure the people’s House truly reflects those we serve.
Legislation in Focus: Expanding Health Care for Breast Cancer Survivors
In January, I reintroduced with my esteemed colleague, Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-FL), H.R.469, the Comprehensive Breast Reconstruction Act of 2021. While advances in medicine and patient care have perfected breast reconstruction, many post-mastectomy patients’ access to these procedures are determined on a case by case basis or are guided by a patchwork of differing policies, restrictions, and guidelines. This can be an unfair burden for patients and their families. Patients shouldn’t have to fight for the care they deserve. This legislation builds on advancements to fix the loopholes in the current patchwork of care available to survivors after a medically-necessary mastectomy, expanding covered procedures and allowing survivors access to the care they need to heal. I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress on this legislation and hope that it will be acted upon swiftly on the House floor.
As the 117th Congress turns its attention to these and other issues, I will continue to advocate for a more open process that benefits all Americans. For more information on the various issues that I am working on, please visit my official website at www.alceehastings.house.gov. With warm personal regards, I remain, 
Sincerely,
￼

2/9/21 17:41,Healing Our Nation,"￼  
Dear Friend,   Today is a historic day, as the Senate trial begins on the article of impeachment that a bipartisan majority of the U.S. House of Representatives passed last month in response to former President Trump’s role in inciting an insurrection against our country. I know that many Oregonians will be tuning in to watch, and I want to share my thoughts about this trial with you -- thoughts based on what millions of people all around the world saw unfold, and what I experienced firsthand, on January 6.    The violent attack on Congress and the Vice President at the United States Capitol resulted in the deaths of five Americans including the murder of a police officer, injured scores more, and put hundreds of lives at risk. The goal was to burn the ballots of millions of Americans and overturn our presidential election to seize power for Donald Trump in defiance of the expressed will of the voters. It was a violent attack on our freedoms, our democracy, our laws, and our Constitution.   While Donald Trump is no longer occupying the Oval Office, we must demand accountability for his “stolen election” conspiracy, lies, propaganda, and incitement of the violent insurrection targeting Congress, the Vice President, and the Capitol. Every senator must consider the facts of the disturbing events that each of us experienced firsthand, consider what is best for the future of this country, and ensure that his behavior is never normalized.   The healing of our nation and the future of our democracy depend on it.   All my best,  Jeff

Honoring Our Heroes
 
Dear Friend,
 
I have the honor of interacting with U.S. Capitol Police officers every day I’m in Washington. They are hardworking, professional, and dedicated to their duty protecting the Capitol, its employees, and all who visit.
 
On Wednesday, I paid my respects to Officer Brian Sicknick—who lost his life from injuries sustained in the line of duty on January 6th—as his remains were lying in honor in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda.
 
My prayers continue to be with his loved ones and the family members of all of our brave law enforcement officers as we mourn this tragic loss.
 
 
￼
 
 
Legislative Business
 
 
The calls for unity and bipartisanship originally promoted by the Biden Administration have been abandoned already. Utilizing an arcane budget procedure, Washington Democrats have decided to ignore House and Senate Republicans — and the millions of Americans they represent — to ram through a partisan COVID relief bill that will cost nearly $2 trillion.
 
That’s why I voted against Democrats' proposed shell budget last week. Instead of focusing on targeted, effective, and bipartisan relief measures – or ensuring the $1 trillion in unspent funds left over from previous relief packages are effectively utilized – they are maneuvering to muscle through a liberal wish list under the guise of a pandemic proposal.
 
This isn’t the first time. Democrats have consistently sought to use COVID-19 as ""an opportunity"" to pass their extreme policies into law. They have fully admitted the tactic in recent years, and the philosophy has continued into the 117th Congress. 
 
They know Republicans won’t be supportive of a wide range of left-wing policies— including enacting a $15 minimum wage that will hurt small businesses and destroy well over one million jobs, bailouts for states like New York and California, whose budget troubles pre-date the coronavirus pandemic, and paying people more to stay on unemployment than to go back to work. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have decided to use budget reconciliation to fast-track their radical agenda – not provide assistance to real Americans who need real help.
 
Democrats are eager to dodge the 60-vote threshold in the Senate and avoid any bipartisan consensus. They know many of their measures are controversial and unrelated to the problem at hand, and therefore, unlikely to garner 60 votes to be passed by regular order. Reconciliation is meant to deal with budgetary policies – it’s not supposed to be weaponized to pass controversial initiatives unrelated to revenues and spending.
 
Last week’s vote was the first step in the Pelosi-Schumer led strategy to implement President Biden’s far-left agenda through reconciliation. House Democrats would rather masquerade their liberal policy priorities as coronavirus relief than work alongside Republicans.
 
We should be focused on creating jobs, distributing vaccines, growing the economy, and reopening schools. Yet in reality, what this package will do is kill jobs and further balloon the national debt, while overlooking the over $1 trillion in unspent relief money available from previous congressional action.
 
Notable examples of remaining funds include:
	•	SBA’s Paycheck Protection Program: $280 billion;
	•	Health Spending: $239 billion;
	•	Economic Injury Disaster Loans: $172 billion;
	•	Unemployment Insurance Expansion: $172 billion;
	•	Education Funding: $59 billion;
	•	State and Local Aid: $58 billion;
	•	Stimulus Checks: $52 billion;
	•	Child Care and Development Block Grant: $10 billion; and
	•	Agriculture: $29 billion.
 
Even a top economic advisor to former President Obama said that the Biden proposal is too big. It’s not targeted, transparent, or collaborative. President Biden and the majority have made it seem like the only way forward is a partisan bill through reconciliation. That is completely false. I urge renewed efforts to reach across the aisle and negotiate in good faith. We should be serving the American people – not our own political objectives.
 
 
 
Committee Action
 
 
On the committee front, I am pleased to announce that I was selected last Wednesday to serve on the Subcommittees on Select Revenue Measures, Trade, and Oversight for the House Ways and Means Committee, the chief tax-writing committee in the U.S House of Representatives.
 
My focus has always been on creating jobs, building communities, and eliminating government barriers. As our nation enters a new era, I look forward to providing an even greater voice for advancing bold solutions to some of the most pressing issues of today.
 
Through my experience in the medical field, as a mayor, and a businessman for over 30 years, I am eager to continue to partner with Ranking Member Kevin Brady to be an effective advocate for the Third District and the state of Georgia.
 
With the goal of increasing opportunity for individuals and families, growing our economy, and harnessing American competitiveness and innovation, I’m ready to roll up my sleeves and get to work.

January Jobs Report
 
 
On Friday, the U.S. Department of Labor released its January jobs report. The sluggish report fell flat, adding less than half the jobs economists were expecting. With Biden signing an executive order to stop the Keystone XL pipeline in his first days in office, he immediately killed thousands of jobs.
 
At a time we should be focused on safely reopening the economy, this action devastated an entire industry. Read more about the January jobs report here.
 
 
 
Building Career Opportunities
 
 
Workers across our nation need access to work-based training to compete on the world stage. That is why I was proud to reintroduce the PARTNERS Act alongside Congresswoman Suzanne Bonamici (OR-01), Congresswoman Haley Stevens (MI-11), and Congressman Brett Guthrie (KY-02) to support apprenticeships and work-based learning programs that provide workers with pathways to better paying jobs and opportunities.
 
 
 
What's on Drew's Docket?
 
 
This week, I will be speaking with Emory President Gregory Fenves, participating in a House Ways and Means Committee hearings, and speaking with constituents about matters that are most important to them.
 
As always, I’m here to serve you. Please contact my office with any questions, comments, or concerns. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to keep track of upcoming legislation and events!

BROADBAND 
Take a Speed Test Here. 
The sad fact is that many places in West Virginia simply do not have access to reliable broadband and the lack of access affects West Virginians every day. Back in 2015, the FCC released a coverage map that stated 99.9% of Americans had wireless coverage. I knew then what I know now: That is just plain wrong. 
HOW MAY WE HELP YOU?

My goal is for me and my staff to provide the best possible customer service for every West Virginian who contacts me needing assistance. While I have no direct jurisdiction in legal or administrative matters of any federal, state, or local agency, I welcome the opportunity to assist you in any way possible and to assure that full consideration is given to your case. See one of our success stories below:

From the Hill to the Mountains
MANCHIN REINTRODUCES BIPARTISAN BILL TO HELP CHILDREN, YOUTH AND FAMILIES EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) introduced the bipartisan Emergency Family Stabilization Act. This legislation would create a new emergency funding stream overseen by the Administration for Children and Families within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to provide flexible funding for community-based organizations working to meet the unique and challenging needs of children, youth, and families experiencing homelessness. Specifically, the bill aims to provide emergency funding to underserved populations and areas, including in rural and tribal communities, who continue to see long-term repercussions of the COVID-19 pandemic.  ""Every child deserves a roof over their head and a safe place to sleep but unfortunately, this is not the case today. The COVID-19 pandemic has only made this problem worse due to high unemployment, unstable living conditions, and job insecurity. Recent research has also found the lack of resources in rural areas of America – like West Virginia – create additional burdens for children and youth experiencing homelessness. The Emergency Family Stabilization Act would help address this issue by dedicating emergency funding to help our children, youth, and families experiencing homelessness during the COVID-19 pandemic. I am working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to include this bipartisan, commonsense legislation in the next COVID-19 relief package,"" said Senator Manchin. 
MANCHIN VOTES TO CONFIRM VA SECRETARY DENIS MCDONOUGH  Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, voted to confirm Denis McDonough as U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA).  ""Today I voted to confirm Denis McDonough as Secretary of Veterans Affairs because the VA needs accountability to ensure they are providing our brave Veterans with the care they deserve. Our West Virginia Veterans have endured unacceptable treatment at two of our VA Medical Centers (VAMC), corroding our Veterans’ trust in the VA system and the care provided to them. I will work with Secretary McDonough as I continue to push for better transparency and accountability at the VA and I expect him to immediately address the longstanding and very serious issues at the VA."" 
MANCHIN SUPPORT FOR OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY HAS NOT CHANGED  Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) released the following statement on his votes during the Senate’s February 4th vote-a-rama.  ""My position on the oil and gas industry has not changed. I have always been and will always be an outspoken advocate for an all-of-the-above energy policy that includes fracking and responsible energy infrastructure development, like the Keystone XL pipeline. Last week, I voted in favor of multiple nonbinding amendments that expressed opposition to a ban on fracking and support for the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. While I was disappointed that these provisions were removed from the final package, I voted to proceed forward on this urgent COVID-19 relief package because West Virginia families are hurting. They need more vaccines. They need more direct aid in the form of targeted checks. They need to know their unemployment benefits won’t run out in a few weeks. I will not let partisan games and political posturing hold this essential assistance hostage. 
Energy Committee News 
MANCHIN URGES PRESIDENT BIDEN TO RECONSIDER KEYSTONE XL DECISION, SUPPORT RESPONSIBLE ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT  Manchin: Pipelines are our safest mode of transport for oil and natural gas   Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin, Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, urged President Biden to reconsider his executive order revoking the cross-border permit for the Keystone XL Pipeline and expressed continued support of the responsible expansion of energy infrastructure, including pipelines.  ""I am writing today to express my support of responsible energy infrastructure development, including of oil and natural gas pipelines. Pipelines continue to be the safest mode to transport our oil and natural gas resources and they support thousands of high-paying, American union jobs. To that end, I encourage you to reconsider your decision to revoke the cross-border permit for the Keystone XL pipeline and take into account the potential impacts of any further action to safety, jobs, and energy security,” Chairman Manchin wrote in part.  Yesterday, Chairman Manchin reiterated his commitment to an all-of-the-above energy policy that includes fracking and responsible energy infrastructure development, like the Keystone XL and Mountain Valley pipelines. Senator Manchin introduced the original Keystone XL pipeline bill in 2012. In 2014 and 2015, Senator Manchin voted in support of the Keystone XL pipeline because he believed it would be a tremendous job creator and secure American energy independence. In 2017, Senator Manchin praised President Trump’s executive order to resume construction on the pipeline.  Read the full letter here.

Congressman Simpson
The Northwest 
In Transition 

￼
Simpson Releases Energy and Salmon Concept
“We can seize this unique opportunity to shape our future; if we all commit to push ourselves outside of our comfort zones and work together to solve these issues ONCE and for all.” – Congressman Mike Simpson
Washington, D.C. – Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson has released a framework for reimagining the Northwest energy landscape and recovering critically endangered salmon populations. For the last three years, he and his staff have held over 300 meetings with stakeholders, tribes, elected representatives and other interests trying to understand and break down the complex issues related to the ongoing litigation, studies, appeals, biological opinions, spill and other issues creating regional uncertainty related to salmon recovery, dams, energy and transportation.
“The Northwest has been caught in an unsustainable cycle of conflicts over salmon and energy,” said Simpson. “For over thirty years, lawsuits, appeals, salmon management directives and endless spending have prevailed, while salmon, energy, agriculture and transportation interests continue to suffer.  What I am releasing today is a proposal to break that cycle and deliver certainty and security to the Northwest without picking winners and losers.”
Simpson has posted a “concept” to his website that outlines a possible path forward for the Northwest to end salmon litigation.  The goal is to protect all stakeholders, maximize the benefits of the Bonneville System and the Northwest’s abundant renewable solar, wind and hydroelectric resources, as well as giving our salmon a much better chance at recovery.
“I understand that after 30 years of litigation and conflict that it is difficult for people to envision a different way forward,” said Simpson. “Changes of this magnitude might be unnerving at first, but we have a unique opportunity to create a solution that finally puts a stop to the never-ending salmon wars. This concept could take Idaho’s salmon off the path toward extinction and put them on a more certain path of sustainability and viability. We CAN protect our stakeholders and modernize our energy system for the next fifty-plus years, and we CAN do this on our terms.” 
Simpson concluded, “I am not releasing legislation today, but I am beginning a conversation and asking the Northwest Delegation, states, tribes, governors, and all stakeholders: ‘What do we want the Northwest to look like in 30, 40, 50 years?’  We can seize this chance to shape our future; if we resist the urge to make snap judgments and instead work together to solve these issues ONCE and for all.  We owe it to future generations to try.” 
The concept can be found in detail on Congressman Simpson’s website. 

Congressman Simpson would like feedback on this concept. Thoughts and comments can be sent to Simpson.concept@mail.house.gov

2/9/21 21:01,Working Together to Vaccinate Eastern Washington,"
 

As you know, the unfortunate reality is that rural areas are at a disadvantage when it comes to health care access and infrastructure. One-size-fits-all approaches to vaccine distribution will only make it more difficult for people in Eastern Washington to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. That’s why I’m strongly urging Governor Inslee to revisit his strategy and work with local public health officials to get as many people vaccinated as possible.
 


I am also aware of reports suggesting that vaccines are being reallocated from rural counties to more urban counties. This is deeply concerning, and my team and I are working to provide the necessary oversight on this process to ensure no one in Eastern Washington is left behind. I’m confident that collaboration and clear, proactive communication will help us achieve our shared goal of getting shots in arms as quickly and safely as possible, so we can get our lives back to normal.
 
 

Last week, I asked you if you supported breaching the Lower Snake River Dams. The results are in, and only 20% of you think that this is a good idea - and I agree! I strongly believe that the Snake River Dams are critical to our way of life in Eastern Washington because of the role they play in providing clean, renewable, reliable, and affordable energy. 

Additionally, the dams on the Columbia and Snake Rivers supply half of the Pacific Northwest’s energy, making them absolutely critical for a reliable, sustainable power grid. Without them, life as we know it in our region would cease to exist.

Unfortunately, there are new proposals going around that are putting these dams in jeopardy, suggesting that we breach them in the name of protecting salmon populations. This approach is flawed, and it simply fails to account for the sweeping impacts that would be felt across Eastern Washington and the entire Pacific Northwest.

The Lower Snake River dams are directly responsible for developing hydropower that benefits every resident, family, and business in our region. That’s why I led a resolution to reaffirm my commitment to protect existing hydropower resources like the Snake River Dams. This is about more than saving our dams. This is about protecting our entire way of life, ensuring that energy costs remain some of the lowest in the country, that Washington-grown wheat and apples make it to markets around the world, and that our region continues to lead the way on carbon-free energy. 

You can read my resolution here. 
 

During the ongoing pandemic, many in Eastern Washington continue to work from home. Do you support building additional broadband infrastructure to improve internet speeds? 
Select one
Yes, rural internet speeds need to improve.
Select
 
No, my internet is fine the way it is.
Select
 
Unsure or undecided.
Select
 
 
 

	•	Hearing on Restoring Federal Climate Change Leadership – As Lead Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee, I attended a hearing on America’s efforts to lead on the issue of climate change. Eastern Washington is a great example of what is possible when we embrace change and seek new, innovative energy solutions. More than 70% of Washington’s energy is generated by clean, renewable hydropower that has resulted in our region having some of the lowest energy costs in the world. To win the future, we must follow this example and lead a new era of innovation 
	•	Phone Call with Acting FEMA Administrator – I spoke with Acting FEMA Administrator Robert Fenton to discuss the recent decision to reject individual assistance to those devastated by wildfires in Whitman County. I am disappointed by this decision, but my team and I are working with every agency and government official to find the best path forward to secure the aid needed to begin rebuilding.  
	•	Energy and Commerce Markup of COVID Relief Package – This week, the Energy and Commerce Committee will mark up the partisan reconciliation package put forth by House Democrats. Using reconciliation for COVID relief abandons the promise of bipartisan work, and I am urging my colleagues to work across the aisle to get real results for the people of Eastern Washington and the rest of the nation. 
 
 

Every single individual in Eastern Washington deserves access to affordable health care coverage, including those with disabilities and other pre-existing conditions. This is one of my top priorities, which is why I introduced legislation to ensure those with pre-existing conditions have guaranteed access to quality care they need. 

The Pre-Existing Conditions Protection Act aims to achieve three important goals for patients:
	•	Guaranteed access to coverage
	•	Prohibiting pre-existing conditions benefit exclusions
	•	Banning a premium rating based on health status

This legislation also protects critical safeguards for patients with pre-existing conditions that would withstand any potential changes in law or decisions from the courts. Additionally, the bill would create a foundation to be built on to continue reforming healthcare for all Americans.

We must work together to expand health care options for Americans, not punish them for things out of their control. I’m confident that this bill will serve as a foundation we can build on to bring down costs, and help individuals keep control over their health care decisions.
 
 

As I shared with you last week, President Joe Biden officially approved the Emergency Disaster Declaration for Malden and Pine City. This breakdown will explain what this means, and what you can expect in the days and weeks ahead.

What is the status of the Emergency Disaster Declaration? President Joe Bide approved the Emergency Disaster Declaration for Washington State on February 4th. In this declaration, public assistance was approved for all 9 counties in the state, including Whitman County. Unfortunately, individual assistance was denied by the Biden administration on February 5th. 

What does this mean for Eastern Washington? The good news is that Whitman County is eligible to receive additional funding to begin rebuilding public property that was destroyed during the fires, including city hall. Unfortunately, despite my requests for approval, Individual Assistance, which would have helped uninsured homeowners, has not been made available for individuals in Malden or Pine City. However, low interest loans from the Small Business Administration to cover business and primary residence losses are now available, as well as mortgage programs through the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Please reach out to our office if we can be of any assistance as you navigate these programs.  

What happens next? I am incredibly disappointed by the decision to reject individual assistance for Whitman County. The individuals, families, and businesses need this assistance. My entire team and I are working closely with FEMA, Senators Murray and Cantwell, and Governor Inslee to find the best path forward that delivers results for the communities devastated by these fires. This is something we will continue working on, and I will keep you updated on our progress. 
 

Q: What will you do to keep gas prices low? - Christine from Spokane Valley 

Thank you for your question. In my role as the Lead Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee, I am fighting to keep gas prices low by pushing back against President Biden’s policies and executive actions that would do the opposite. 

As you know, individuals, families, and businesses continue to struggle due to the economic hardship brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. The last thing our community needs are policies that drive up energy prices and make it more difficult to put food on the table.

Unfortunately, many of the president’s actions and proposals are putting affordable energy at risk. For example, on his first day in office President Biden ended construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline and ordered a review of the regulatory relief President Trump achieved. President Biden has also ordered an indefinite moratorium of oil and gas development on federal land. I have taken a number of actions to push back on these orders that would result in families in Eastern Washington paying more for gas and other utilities.

I am determined to lead our country down a more constructive path. That’s why I am supporting the Keystone XL Pipeline Construction and Jobs Act to make sure America can continue to be energy independent, I am calling on President Biden to reverse his unilateral order ending energy development on federal lands, and I will fight against a return of the burdensome top-down, one-size-fits-all approach to environmental regulations that drives up energy prices. 

My goal as Lead Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee is to support clean, renewable, and reliable energy sources - like the hydropower we are so familiar with along the Columbia and Snake River System - to make sure energy costs like gasoline in Eastern Washington remain some of the lowest in the world.

What question would you like to see answered next week?

2/10/21 10:27,Poll: How do we fill the shortage of American trade jobs?,"
￼
￼
￼

Dear Hoosiers,
 
As our 21st century economy grows, so does the need to fill trade positions in America. According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation, “74% of hiring managers agree that there is a skills gap in the current labor market, with 48% saying that candidates lack the skills needed to fill open jobs.” American businesses and manufacturers are struggling to find qualified candidates to fill in-demand jobs and it remains critical that we properly prepare our workforce for an ever-evolving economy.  

To that end, there are numerous options leaders at the local, state, and federal levels believe can help increase preparedness and interest in trade careers. Last Congress, I introduced the DRIVE Safe Act, which works to encourage more young people to enter the truck driving industry, and just last week, the House of Representatives took action to reinforce apprenticeship programs across the country. 

I voted against the recent House action because it doesn’t allow enough flexibility for businesses to create apprenticeships that fit their specific industry needs and implements barriers to enter the programs. I believe we need to be enabling more opportunities for hands-on experience, not less. 
 
QUESTION OF THE WEEK: Which option do you think best bridges the skills gap and fills the shortage of American trade jobs? 
 
[_] We should increase access to apprenticeships and other real-world training programs 
[_] We should invest in STEM courses 
[_] We should provide more federal assistance and encourage attendance to two-year technical programs versus four-year institutions 
[_] We don’t need more technical education 
[_] I don’t know 
[_] Other

Introducing the More Accountability is Necessary Now (MANN) Acts

On February 2, I introduced H.R. 713-718, the More Accountability is Necessary Now (MANN) Acts. The MANN Acts include six pieces of legislation promoting accountability and transparency in future executive orders made by the Executive Branch.

The MANN Acts will require the Executive Branch to notify Congress with its intent to issue any new, or revoke any existing, executive order pertaining to these six areas:

	•	Agriculture, Food, and the Livelihood of American Farmers, Ranchers, and Producers
	•	Energy
	•	America’s Natural Resources and the Environment
	•	Pro-life Provisions Including the Hyde Amendment and the Right to Life
	•	The Second Amendment of the U.S. Constitution
	•	Immigration into the United States

Watch my video on walking to the House Floor and introducing the Mann Acts below: 
 
 

Maiden Floor Speech

This week I delivered my maiden speech on the Floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. I am proud to represent the Big First and it is an honor to speak on its behalf. 

The Big First is home to the geographic center of our great Nation and a tremendous amount of common sense and sound judgment. I work hard to take the perspective of Kansans to Washington, D.C. and let it inform the policy I pursue. 

In my speech I talked about my legislation, the More Accountability is Necessary Now Acts (MANN Acts). These six pieces of legislation would require the White House to give Americans 30-days notice before an Executive Order can be signed. This would ensure the voices of Kansans are heard BEFORE any Executive Orders are signed by the President. The Executive branch was NOT created to legislate - Congress was. 

I did not come to Congress to be a caretaker in the slow demise of America - I ran so I could fight and work to make it stronger. That's what I intend to do while believing that our brightest days are yet to come.

Watch the full speech below: 
 
 

Committee Assignments

It is an honor to have secured placement on the House Agriculture Committee and the House Veterans Affairs Committee. I look forward to advocating on behalf of our agriculture industry and the service members in the Big First.
 


House Agriculture Committee
﻿
“I’m pleased to welcome Congressman Mann to the House Agriculture Committee. The lessons learned growing up on his family farm in Kansas make him particularly attuned to the needs of our rural communities,” said Rep. Glenn “GT” Thompson, Republican Leader of the House Agriculture Committee. “Tracey’s perspective will be crucial as we move forward to restore a robust rural economy and support the hard working men and women of our nation’s agricultural sector.”  

My roots in agriculture run deep. I understand agriculture and have a passion for our rural way of life. These are the three priorities I will focus on in the Agriculture Committee:

	•	Protect and Strengthen Crop Insurance: Agriculture faces risks and uncertainty unlike any other industry, and I will work to make sure that producers have the tools needed to manage this risk.

	•	Stop Regulatory and Administrative Overreach: I will push back on regulations, conduct oversight as the Biden Administration introduces executive orders, and work to stop overreach from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Interior, and other federal agencies.

	•	Increase Trade: Holding China accountable to Phase 1 commitments in our current trade deal is my highest priority. I will also work to shift the focus to a long-term approach that benefits our agriculture partners for years to come.
 
 

House Veterans Affairs Committee


“I am so happy to have Rep. Mann serving on the Committee on Veterans’ Affairs this Congress,"" said Ranking Member of the Veterans Affairs Committee Mike Bost. He brings a wealth of experience in business and politics to the table, along with a passion for rural America. I have no doubt he will serve veterans in Kansas and across the country well over the next two years.” 




I am a proud supporter of our military. Our servicemembers deserve health and job security following their service to our country. As a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee I will prioritize the following issues:

	•	Workforce Transition Programs: I will work to make the transition from active duty to civilian life is as seamless as possible for our veterans. Job resources are an essential part to that process.

	•	Health Services: I will work to ensure veterans in rural Kansas have access to quality health care from the provider of their choosing, including via telemedicine.

	•	Top Quality Education Assistance, Housing Services, and Financial Benefits: I will work to ensure veterans have the assistance they need. A top priority of mine is to have accessibility and efficiency within these programs.
 
 

Protecting and Supporting Kansas Energy

I addressed the Biden Administration's executive actions that negatively impact Kansas energy producers. The Big First is made up of communities that grow and shrink with oil and gas prices, and they deserve common sense energy policies from Washington, D.C. President Biden delivered mixed messages claiming to support fossil fuels and American jobs, but has issued many harmful executive orders, including dismantling the Keystone Pipeline. I will do everything I can to support our Kansas energy sector. From fossil fuels to renewable fuels Kansas energy is a priority for me.

2/10/21 10:58,Reminder: COVID-19 Vaccine Updates and Other Important News,"
 
 
 

February 7, 2021
 

Dear Neighbor, 
 
Today is the big day! Best of luck to our very own Tampa Bay Buccaneers as they compete in the first ever Hometown Super Bowl! I know many of us are looking forward to an exciting evening for our favorite team and our community. I predict a big Bucs’ win!
 
Unfortunately, I am not so optimistic about the American people continuing to win under this new administration. Our country has serious problems and remains deeply divided. We need to come together and find areas of agreement rather than continuing to stoke political division. However, since taking office, President Biden has unilaterally taken 42 Executive actions on highly controversial issues which further divide our nation. This is far more than his recent predecessors in either party. 
 

Now, he and Congressional Democrats are contemplating the use of a special budget procedural maneuver to avoid having to negotiate with Republicans on another new stimulus package. While more targeted relief measures may indeed be needed to improve vaccine distribution and help those who are still struggling to recover from the pandemic, there has not even been a serious discussion about how much of the billions of dollars of federal funding already allocated has yet to be dispersed. Consider these important figures:

First Pandemic Supplemental - $8 billion 
Families First Coronavirus Response Act-$192 billion 
CARES Act- $1.72 trillion 
Paycheck Protection Program and Health-$483 billion 
Consolidated Appropriations Act FY 2021- $1,043 trillion 
Proposed New Biden Stimulus - $1.9 trillion
Higher Debt Interest from 5 previous and 1 proposed pandemic relief measure- $400 billion 
Total Allocated and Proposed Measures- $5,747 trillion 
Total Amount of Previously Allocated Funds Already Dispersed - ? 

We have not examined which prior relief programs are working and those which are not reaching targeted goals. For example, I am a strong supporter of public education. We have allocated billions of funding to help students safely return to the classroom and yet more than half of the states in our country have not reopened in-person learning sites. In Florida, we followed the science and school has been back in session all year. The science said it was relatively safe to have students and teachers return to the classroom, with appropriate safeguards in place, especially when weighed against the very real socio-emotional and educational concerns associated with not re-opening in person learning opportunities. We have seen very few problems with COVID-19 transmission in our classrooms, but the burden of managing that process and paying for those safeguards has largely fallen to state and local governments. We have not seen a large influx of federal funding to support the safeguards that were necessary to re-open classrooms, even though billions of dollars have been allocated. It is logical to ask where the allocated funds have gone and why we need to appropriate $170 billion more for education through this new stimulus proposal, especially if there are not imminent plans to follow the science and immediately re-open schools throughout the country.  

Last week, I joined my colleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee to officially request this type of information of the Biden Administration. Informed decision-making is critical for ensuring that any future legislative measures will meet the needs that exist. Instead of asking these important questions, the relief measure being pushed quickly through Congress ushers in long-standing Democratic priorities such as bailing out local and state governments for non-pandemic expenses, raising the federal minimum wage, and extending federal unemployment benefits through the end of 2021.    

The actions taken during the past two weeks do not reflect a commitment to heal the nation and find common ground.  I remain focused on working across party lines to find common sense solutions that will help all Americans during this difficult time.
 
Please continue reading for some important information. 
 

Vaccinating Seniors and Strengthening our Medical Supply Chain
    
I know that the vaccination distribution process continues to be confusing and frustrating for many local seniors. Currently, it is important to realize that seniors have a few primary options for getting a vaccination. If they live in Pasco, they can register through the Pasco health department's CDR system and then log in to try to obtain an appointment once those slots are released on Sundays at 2:00 p.m. They can also pre-register through the state's new process, reserve their space in line for a vaccine and be notified when a dose is available. I was relieved to see Pinellas County announce improvements to its vaccination process. Hopefully these changes will make it easier for seniors. Additionally, Publix locations in Pasco and Pinellas are now offering seniors the COVID-19 vaccine. You can learn more about how to register through Publix here. I am continuing to share your feedback with the state and local officials who have jurisdiction over this process and believe it will continue to improve. 

As noted in this local news report, I am glad to see that the state of Florida received more than 300,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccine last week- a more than 40,000 increase from our previous weekly allocation from the federal government. I will continue to advocate for additional doses for Florida, and for an expansion of the federal pharmacy program.  

As part of the federal effort to expand access to the COVID-19 vaccine and after months of groundwork, the CDC has activated the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program. While additional details are still being finalized, an initial one million doses of vaccine will be sent to participating pharmacies around the nation on February 11th. Participating pharmacies in Florida include: Publix; Walmart and Southeastern Grocers. This program will run in tandem with the Pharmacy Partnership for Long-Term Care Program, a program used to prioritize vaccination of seniors in long-term care facilities. It is separate from the allocation each state is receiving from the federal government for distribution. These state allocations are currently being distributed through a variety of locations including: local health departments, state sites, and Publix. I will continue to support all efforts to increase circulation of the vaccine to Floridians and will share more information when it becomes available.

Many constituents have asked how people under 65 with severe medical conditions can sign up for COVID-19 vaccination. Here is some limited information. Once more information is available, I will share it. 

During last week’s Health Subcommittee hearing, I discussed the work being done to improve seniors’ access to a COVID-19 vaccine and the fact that our state needs more doses for distribution. I also highlighted the need to modernize our nation’s emergency supply chain to ensure we are less dependent on foreign governments during future emergencies. Click here to listen to my exchange with panelists.  
 
 

Consumer Protection Connection
 
During this week’s kick off meeting of the Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee, we examined the scams that bad actors have used during the COVID pandemic to exploit seniors and other vulnerable populations. During my remarks, I highlighted the disgusting example in Pasco County in which someone made a fake Eventbrite account to sell phony vaccine appointments to seniors. We must do all we can to educate vulnerable populations about these duplicitous scams, put safeguards in place to protect the public, and prosecute those who perpetrate these crimes. Click here to listen to my remarks. 
Sadly, this local news report highlights how scammers are seeking to exploit vulnerable populations desperate to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine. Remember, by law, all COVID-19 vaccines are to be made available free of charge, without co-payments or deductibles, including for those who are uninsured. 

Additionally, this story serves as a good reminder that exploitation often comes from unexpected sources. Remember, nursing home and ALF providers are not legally allowed to take seniors’ stimulus checks. Any incidence of theft should be reported to the Florida Attorney General’s office.  
 
 

Fighting Childhood Cancer
 
Pediatric cancer remains the number one disease that leads to the death of American children. While survival rates have improved for some types of pediatric cancers, thousands of children are lost to cancer each year and many more encounter life threatening complications related to harsh chemotherapies. Children have significantly fewer treatment options than adults and oftentimes must rely on treatment regimens developed for adults because pediatric-specific treatments simply do not exist for many pediatric cancers and rare diseases. 
 
The Gabriella Miller Kids First Pediatric Research Program at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is working to facilitate a better understanding of pediatric cancers and holds the promise for the development of better treatments and possible cures. As a longtime advocate for children and rare disease patients, I was proud to co-author bipartisan legislation last week which will provide a new funding source for this successful program.  

Specifically, our new bill will redirect penalties levied against pharmaceutical, cosmetic, supplement, and medical device companies by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for violating the Foreign Corrupt Practice Act (FCPA) towards the Kids First program. In recent years, hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties have been levied against these companies, and the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act 2.0 will help channel those funds directly to critical medical research focused on children. 
 
 

Facilitating Economic Recovery

Right now, we should be focused on helping Americans get back to work, rebuild their businesses, and safely send their children back to school.  I am disappointed to see so many Executive Actions taking us in the opposite direction. 
 

However, we are seeing some encouraging signs for our local economy. For example, I am glad to see projections that our local housing market will continue to remain strong this year.  
 

Additionally, the recent announcement of Moffitt’s new research facility in Pasco County is another exciting economic development opportunity for our entire region. Moffitt's expansion project is expected to support 14,500 new jobs and will help the hospital continue critical research as it seeks to prevent and cure cancer. 
 
 

Protecting our Children 
 
There is no higher priority than keeping our children safe. By providing high quality screening and prevention training to school staff and peers, we can identify threats before they materialize, and ensure that those who are at risk get the mental health treatment they need. I have seen first-hand how effective these programs can be when I visited a high school in Pinellas which has already implemented these best practices. Sadly, some communities in my district are among those with the highest suicide rates in our state, and the pandemic has only exacerbated the problem. With training like this, we can help reverse that troubling trend, which is why my colleagues and I re-introduced the STAND-UP Act last week. Click here to learn more.  
 
 

Helping our Heroes

Veteran unemployment rates have been disproportionately high throughout the pandemic. I am hosting a Veteran Employment Fair later this month in order to connect Veterans, Guard and Reserve members and spouses of Veterans and active duty personnel with available positions in our community. Please feel free to share this information as appropriate. 
 
 

Community Concentration 

My team recently had the opportunity to participate in a briefing on Human Trafficking which featured speakers from the FBI, U.S. Attorney’s Office- Middle District and Department of Homeland Security. These agencies are working in a coordinated manner to identify cases and support victims. Unfortunately, studies have shown that human trafficking rates historically spike when cities host large-scale events. As we prepare to host today’s Super Bowl, we can all do our part to remain alert and report any suspicious activity to law enforcement. 
 

My team had the privilege of participating in the recent graduation of the Pasco County Housing Authority’s Self Sufficiency Program. Every program graduate was able to leverage the skills learned to realize the dream of home ownership. Congratulations to each of these families and best wishes for your continued success.﻿
 

Additionally, my team enjoyed participating in the Grand Opening of HD Real Estate Company with the North Tampa Bay Chamber last week. Congratulations to owner Ray Hendricks and best wishes on his continued success. 
 
 

Constituent Corner

I recently received this message from a constituent in my district. 

On Friday January 22nd, we sent a letter requesting the Congressman’s assistance with resolving a delay in our son’s security clearance. Our son called us the following Tuesday to report that he’d been given his clearance! Not even two full business days later!  At first, we thought it must just be a coincidence, but no, it was one phone call from the Congressman’s office!  If that’s not amazing, I don’t know what is! Congressman Bilirakis and his staff care and get things done. We are thankful to have him to call upon in a situation like this where you feel like you have no control and there’s nothing you can do. Maybe we can’t, but he sure can! Thank-you Congressman Bilirakis and all the hard-working and caring staff in your office. Especially Rob, who reached out to follow-up with us.  We are truly grateful. 

This is just one example of the work we do each day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!

Sincerely,
 

Gus Bilirakis
Member of Congress

Congressional Report
 
 
Dear Friend,   Last week, I announced that I will continue to serve as the Vice Chair of the House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Appropriations. With a new administration and Congress, we have an opportunity to rethink our national security. After four years, it’s time to stop funneling money away from the military towards an ineffective border wall. We must fund smart technology and additional personnel to keep out criminals, drugs, and other threats to America’s safety. As the Vice Chair, I will work hard to invest in innovative and collaborative programs that advance the prosperity, security, and success of the United States. 
 
In the 117th Congress, I will also continue to serve on the Defense and Agriculture Subcommittees on Appropriations. As a member of the Defense Subcommittee, I will deliver funding for our service men and women and ensure the readiness and modernization of our nation’s armed forces. During my time in the Agriculture Subcommittee, I will work for our nation’s farmers and ranchers as well as address the needs of rural America.
 
As always, if you need assistance with a federal agency, reach out to my office. 
 
I also urge you to follow me on social media, @repcuellar, to stay up to date on new developments in Washington, DC and the district.

Our COVID trial, and mine: A congressman on the vaccine and his positive diagnosis

By Rep. Adriano Espaillat
Original Article Published in New York Daily
February 6, 2021


In New York City and in communities throughout the United States, COVID-19 remains a very real — and a very deadly — threat. The losses being faced by countless Americans are insurmountable, especially as we mourn the loss of more than 400,000 American lives, and livelihoods continue to be put on the line.

My district has been hit especially hard, and my heart breaks for countless of my constituents who have been directly impacted, especially those who have been forced to enter critical care at our local hospitals — many not being able to breathe, and many never leaving to see their families again.

￼

This is an unprecedented time for our communities and the availability of COVID-19 vaccines are at the crux of how we tackle this crisis.
For so many, the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines present a light at the end of the tunnel, a possibility to return to normal life, and the ability to survive this harrowing crisis. And on behalf of those Americans, I remain grateful for the steadfast efforts put forth from leaders in our scientific communities who have worked to ensure all Americans have a fighting chance against this deadly virus and the ability to return to normalcy in due course.
In December, I received the first dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and then received the necessary second dose in early January. Yet on Jan. 13, 2021, I tested positive for COVID-19.

This is a hopeful story. Because the vaccine was effective, creating an antibody response to lessen the severity of symptoms associated with coronavirus, my life was saved. I was given the opportunity to live and breathe another day, an opportunity not afforded to everyone at the hands of this heartbreaking pandemic.

As the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states in its guidance, the COVID-19 vaccine is just one piece of a larger puzzle, requiring us all to continue to adhere to strict guidelines to ensure the health and safety of ourselves, our families, and those around us. Despite my best intentions and persistence in wearing a face mask, social distancing from others and vigorous personal hygiene as recommended by the CDC and our nation’s leading doctors, scientists and public health experts, I still tested positive — and you can too.

I had the privilege and opportunity to speak with Dr. Anthony Fauci, our nation’s leading infectious disease expert, after testing positive for COVID-19, and he made clear that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine I received was the sole reason I did not require immediate and intensive emergency care. Absent this vaccine, my health would have rapidly deteriorated, and quite possibly, I could have faced a fatal fate.

This vaccine undoubtedly saved my life. It could save yours too. I urge you to get your shot when you are eligibile.

Fauci made clear that even with vaccines slowly becoming more available, we must not become complacent, and we must continue to do all we can to protect the health and safety of those around us — by wearing a face mask in public settings, adhering to strict social distancing guidelines and washing our hands routinely. Only by following these steps, in tandem with vaccination, do we have a fighting chance against COVID-19.

This experience was eye-opening, and it is why I have vowed to do all I possibly can to bring more available vaccines to our neighborhoods, to get in touch with those most vulnerable in my district to help coordinate appointments, and most of all, fight to close racial equity gaps for Black, Latino, and other minority residents.

We know that our minority communities have been the hardest hit by coronavirus — from the number of lives lost, businesses forced to close, to the ongoing struggle to rebuild — and in New York, Latinos have the highest rates of infection and death among nearly all groups.

Now that vaccines have become available to eligible constituents, and after this chilling experience, my office has continued working with community partners to ensure testing and vaccination availability, and will not stop until we ensure that these resources are available and accessible to everyone — especially our most vulnerable.I encourage each and every one of you reading this today who are eligible to receive the vaccine to do so as soon as you can. I am living proof that it saves lives — and it can save yours too.

Nuestro ensayo del COVID, y el mío: Sobre la vacuna de un congresista y su diagnóstico positivo
Por Rep. Adriano Espaillat Artículo original publicado en New York Daily
6 de febrero de 2021


En la ciudad de Nueva York y en las comunidades de todo Estados Unidos, el COVID-19 sigue siendo una amenaza muy real y mortal. Las pérdidas que enfrentan innumerables estadounidenses son insuperables, especialmente la lamentable pérdida de más de 400,000 vidas estadounidenses, y los medios de subsistencia continúan en riesgo.

Mi distrito se ha visto especialmente afectado, y se me parte el corazón por un sinnúmero de mis constituyentes que se han visto afectados directamente, especialmente aquellos que se han visto obligados a ingresar a cuidados intensivos en nuestros hospitales locales; muchos son ingresados sin poder respirar y muchos se van de este mundo sin poder volver a ver a sus familias.

￼

Este es un momento sin precedentes para nuestras comunidades y la disponibilidad de las vacunas contra el COVID-19 es un elemento esencial de la forma en que enfrentaremos esta crisis.

Para muchos, las vacunas Pfizer/BioNTech y Moderna representan una luz al final del túnel, la posibilidad de volver a la vida normal y la capacidad de sobrevivir a esta desgarradora crisis. Y en nombre de esos estadounidenses, sigo agradecido por los firmes esfuerzos realizados por los líderes de nuestras comunidades científicas que han trabajado para garantizar que todos los estadounidenses tengan la oportunidad de luchar contra este virus mortal y la capacidad de volver a la normalidad a su debido tiempo.

En diciembre, recibí la primera dosis de la vacuna Pfizer/BioNTech contra el COVID-19 y luego recibí la segunda dosis necesaria a principios de enero. Sin embargo, el 13 de enero de 2021, di positivo en la prueba de COVID-19.

Esta es una historia esperanzadora. Gracias a que la vacuna fue efectiva y creó una respuesta de anticuerpos para disminuir la gravedad de los síntomas asociados con el coronavirus, me salvó la vida. Se me dio la oportunidad de vivir y respirar otro día, una oportunidad que no se brinda a todos los que han caído en manos de esta desgarradora pandemia.

Como afirman en su guía los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades (CDC) de EE.UU., la vacuna contra el COVID-19 es solo una pieza de un rompecabezas más grande, que requiere que todos sigamos cumpliendo con pautas estrictas para garantizar la salud y la seguridad de nosotros mismos, nuestras familias y los que nos rodean. A pesar de mis mejores intenciones y persistencia en el uso de mascarilla, el distanciamiento social y una higiene personal vigorosa según lo recomendado por los CDC y los principales médicos, científicos y expertos en salud pública de nuestra nación, todavía obtuve un resultado positivo, y a usted también le puede pasar.

Tuve el privilegio y la oportunidad de hablar con el Dr. Anthony Fauci, el principal experto en enfermedades infecciosas de nuestra nación, después de dar positivo por COVID-19, y él dejó en claro que la vacuna Pfizer/BioNTech que recibí era la única razón por la que no necesitaba cuidados intensivos e inmediatos de emergencia. Sin esta vacuna, mi salud se habría deteriorado rápidamente y, muy posiblemente, podría haber enfrentado un destino fatal.

Esta vacuna sin duda me salvó la vida. También podría salvar la tuya. Le pido que se vacune cuando sea elegible.
Fauci dejó en claro que incluso con las vacunas cada vez más disponibles, no debemos volvernos complacientes y debemos continuar haciendo todo lo posible para proteger la salud y la seguridad de quienes nos rodean, usando una mascarilla en entornos públicos, observando estrictas pautas de distanciamiento social, y lavándonos las manos constantemente. Solo siguiendo estos pasos, junto con la vacunación, tenemos una oportunidad de luchar contra el COVID-19.

Esta experiencia fue reveladora, y es por eso por lo que he prometido hacer todo lo posible para traer más vacunas disponibles a nuestros vecindarios, para ponerme en contacto con los más vulnerables en mi distrito para ayudar a coordinar citas y, sobre todo, luchar para cerrar las brechas de equidad racial para los residentes afroamericanos, latinos y otras minorías.

Sabemos que nuestras comunidades minoritarias han sido las más afectadas por el coronavirus, tanto por el número de vidas perdidas, como por los negocios obligados a cerrar, y las dificultades en curso para reconstruir; y en Nueva York, los latinos tienen las tasas más altas de infección y muerte entre casi todos los otros grupos.

Ahora que las vacunas están disponibles para los constituyentes elegibles, y después de esta experiencia escalofriante, mi oficina ha continuado trabajando con socios comunitarios para garantizar la disponibilidad de las pruebas y las vacunas, y no se detendrá hasta que nos aseguremos de que estos recursos estén disponibles y accesibles para todos, especialmente para nuestros constituyentes más vulnerables. Los animo a todos y cada uno de los que leen esto hoy y son elegibles para recibir la vacuna a que la tomen lo antes posible. Soy la prueba viviente de que salva vidas, y también puede salvar la suya.

2/10/21 15:10,4th District Broadband Survey,"￼
Dear    

I would like to ask for you to help us by completing our 4th District Broadbansd Survey.   

People across the 4th District, which makes up parts of 16 counties in North Alabama, are encouraged to complete the survey linked below. 

https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=mYITktAiSU2NMHFw1YltmC9-tu2CmF1Lu_OGDbb3JxNUQjk0TzZIRlE1SlFTODlPS1JDRjZMM1VPOS4u 

We ask that only those who live in the 4th District complete the survey.). The survey will be available until Friday, February 19, 2021. 

The survey is being conducted to gauge where in the District broadband is available, the interest in obtaining broadband access, and how people currently use the internet. 

When Americans first started using the internet back in the 1990s, it was more of a luxury and seen as something fun rather than essential. But in 2021, having access to high-speed internet is just as essential as electricity and running water.  Since I created the ReConnect Program in 2018, thousands of homes across the 4th District have been connected to broadband, but there are still areas where it isn't available.  This survey will help us to determine where in the District the biggest needs still exist.  I encourage all people in the 4th District to complete this survey. 

People who do not currently have access to broadband at their homes are encouraged to take the survey when they are in a location which does have access, such as their workplace, school or on a public Wi-Fi system. 

Thank you for your help. 


  

           Sincerely, 

     ￼

2/10/21 16:00,Balderson Refutes Sham Report on Ohio Energy Industry,"￼

 
Balderson Refutes Sham Report on Ohio Energy Industry
 
  
ZANESVILLE – Congressman Troy Balderson (R-OH) is refuting claims made in a new report by think tank Ohio River Valley Institute stating that “22 counties in Ohio, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia responsible for 90% of Appalachia's oil and gas production saw their share of the nation's jobs, personal income and population all decline,” according to the Columbus Dispatch. Balderson and a group of key stakeholders in Ohio—including industry leaders and local officials—insist the report is misleading and does not present all relevant data, such as figures showing per capita income increasing for residents of Ohio’s counties cited in the report.
  
￼
  
Balderson recently visited a small, independent fracturing operation in Southeastern Ohio.
  
“This so-called report is nothing more than a scam to undermine the energy sector, which has long withstood slanderous labels and stereotypes that demean the livelihoods of blue-collar workers,” said Balderson, a Zanesville native. “In reality, thousands of Ohioans rely on energy jobs to support their families, and in turn, these jobs lay the foundation for the regions’ total economy by supporting small local suppliers, restaurants, and more. Rather than attacking these jobs, we should be asking ourselves where Ohio would be without the oil and gas industry—and the reliable, affordable energy it produces.”
  
Want to stay up-to-date on the latest news and information from Washington and across Ohio's 12th Congressional District? Click here to update your contact preferences. 
  
“Besides the massive drop in unemployment rate since the shale boom started, we have seen businesses creating jobs and investing in these communities,” said Matt Hammond, President of the Ohio Oil and Gas Association. “This investment, in part, has led to specific examples of new school buildings and community centers being constructed, funded almost entirely from the oil and gas industry.”
 
“Over the last 7 years on the Cain family dairy farm, we have been able to repair or build new buildings, purchase equipment, and automate the feeding and milking of the dairy herd, all things that help us operate safer and more efficient,” said Larry Cain, a farmer in Belmont County. “We could not have done all of this without the additional income from the development of the natural gas on our property. Our farm has a much brighter future now and for generations to come.”
 
“Monroe County has seen firsthand the positive impact natural gas has had on our region,” said Mick Schumacher, Monroe County Commissioner. “A major employer left town a few years ago and we would have been a ghost town without oil and gas. It saved us. These new jobs in the industry went to our residents and they have spent their hard-earned dollars on their farms and in our communities. We support what they are doing and want it to continue for many years into the future. “
 
“The oil and gas activity in Guernsey County represented a catalyst to our local culture, which impacted every aspect of our economy,” said Norm Blanchard, Guernsey County Port Authority. “Our unemployment rate was reduced almost in half and has remained there due in part to residual energy activities. New hotels were constructed to house energy workers and were filled at 97% capacity. These hotels remain viable while restaurants, gas stations, and new retail entities received a boost from increased activity in the industry. For example, many individuals such as those in our farming community were able to modernize equipment, refurbish homes and barns, and relieve long-standing debt. County roads utilized to service well pads and pipeline construction were returned, in most cases, to much better condition than prior to the increased traffic.”
 
“The article in the Dispatch is only telling one side of the story and chooses not to focus on the positives that have taken place in our region and state over the past 10 years,” said Nick Homrighausen, Executive Director of the Harrison County Community Improvement Corp. “Regionally, our county’s coffers have been improved and allowed for some reinvestment in much needed infrastructure. Specifically, in Harrison County the oil and gas growth allowed our county to be the fastest growing in Ohio and ranked #4 in the nation in gross domestic product (GDP) growth, according to a 2019 Wall Street Journal article. The county recorded a 129.5% GDP growth rate from 2012 to 2015, and a GDP amount of $732.2 million. Manufacturing was found to be the fastest-growing industry.”
 
“The positive impact of the Utica Shale on our company (which is 100% employee owned) cannot be understated,” said Frank Leeper, President of Producer Services Corp. “In business since 1981, we were faced with a dramatic decline in demand for our services but were able to grow the company from about 35 employees in 2010 to a high of about 250 by the start of 2019. These were well paying jobs with great benefits directly linked to shale development. To conclude the Utica Shale has had a negative impact on Ohio, simply does not reflect the reality we and many other businesses have experienced.”
 
In Ohio, the report focuses on seven counties between 2008-2019: Belmont, Carroll, Jefferson, Harrison, Guernsey, Noble, and Monroe. According to the most recent available data from Ohio Development Services Agency, between 2008-2018:
	•	All seven counties experienced an increase in per capita personal income by an average of 36.67%.
	•	Harrison County experienced the largest income increase of 44.65%.
	•	Noble County experienced the smallest income increase of 20.84%.
	•	While population steadily declined in most of the counties since the mid-20th Century, the population decline stabilized in all seven counties in the past decade.
	•	Noble County experienced a population increase since the mid-20th Century.
 
Other studies have also reported findings that contradict claims made by the Ohio River Valley Institute:
	•	According to a study by the American Petroleum Institute, the oil and gas industry supports 262,800 jobs in Ohio.
	•	This study also finds that the oil and gas industry annually contributes $37.9 billion to Ohio’s economy.
	•	According  to a study by The Ohio State University, Ohio has become a major domestic producer of oil and natural gas as intense production from the Marcellus and Utica Shale formations continue to expand.
	•	This study also reports that Ohio is home to two of the nation’s largest shale formations in the Marcellus shale and Utica shale, further exposing the opportunity for Ohio’s economy to expand in the decades to come.
	•	According to findings by U.S. Energy Information Administration, from 2012 to 2018, Ohio’s natural gas production increased 28-fold, with “almost all” of the state’s natural gas coming from the Utica shale.
	•	According to these same findings, Ohio currently ranks fifth in the United States in natural gas production.
	•	According to a study by the Global Energy Institute, banning fracturing would cost Ohio 700,000 jobs and $245 billion by 2025.
	•	According to this same study, Ohio household incomes would decline by $119 billion and the cost of living would increase by $5,625 per person.
	•	According to a study by Ohio University, Ohio’s shale industry contributed $22.34 billion to the state’s economy in 2015.
	•	This study also found that Ohio’s shale industry supported 147,126 full- and part-time jobs in 2015.
	•	A study by IHS predicts Ohio’s oil and gas industry will support more than 266,624 jobs by 2035.
	•	This study also found that “struggling rural areas” in Ohio are being transformed by the shale boom.
	•	The U.S. Energy Information Administration also finds that Ohio has four crude oil refineries, giving it the “seventh-largest crude oil-refining capacity in the nation.
	•	Their findings also state that 72.2% of Ohio homes are heated with natural gas, fuel oil, and propane.
	•	They also find that natural gas is used to help meet “increased demand” in winter to heat Ohio homes and businesses.
“Clearly, despite what this think tank’s report claims, the oil and gas industry creates hundreds of thousands of well-paying, steady jobs for Ohioans,” said Balderson. “This is further proof that the Biden Administration should actually support America’s job-creating energy industry rather than actively working to dismantle it.”

2/10/21 18:31,"IMPEACHMENT: I Voted ""NO"" to Stand Up for the Constitution","
￼
￼
￼

Hello Lindsey,
 
Democrats moved forward with a second impeachment of former President Donald Trump by introducing their argument in the Senate today. 
 
When this unprecedented, second impeachment of President Trump came to a vote in the House in January, I voted no. 

I said this before, and I’ll say it again: This rushed impeachment process undermines the Constitutional process.  

We were given just two hours of debate to discuss these articles of impeachment. There were no testimonies under oath, witnesses, sober deliberation, or regular processes of House Judiciary Committee hearings. In contrast, think back to the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. The House of Representatives took part in 14 hours of debate and the Senate voted on his removal from office after five weeks of consideration.  
 
> > > Click here for my full remarks on my January 13th NO vote on impeachment.  
 
Remember when House Democrats impeached President Trump for the first time in December 2019? That's when they severely lowered the bar for impeachment.  
 
My thoughts in December 2019:
￼

Fast forward to January 2021, Democrats weren’t satisfied with that standard, so they’ve created an even more abysmal benchmark for impeachment. Speaker Pelosi held no hearings, called no witnesses, and rushed the process through in just 36 hours.
 
Republican and Democratic members of Congress alike must lead on this issue by toning down the divisive rhetoric and encouraging unity, but this botched impeachment only fans the flames of an already out of control fire. I implore my colleagues in the Senate to stand up for the Constitution and acquit former President Trump.
 
 
 
Thank you and God bless,

In Response to Recent SSA Mishandling of Personally Identifiable Information
 
 
Dear Friend,
 
My office was recently informed of reports that a federal agency, the Social Security Administration, had inadvertently mailed personal information to the wrong recipients. Immediately, my staff reached out to the SSA Charlotte Field Office and was able to confirm that, due to employee error, this was indeed true.
 
In response to our inquiry, we have learned that the Social Security Administration Charlotte Field Office has already begun taking steps to contact the impacted individuals and secure the information, as quickly as possible.  In addition, they are addressing the situation by –
 
1. working to ensure all documents are returned or replaced,
 
2. assisting with blocking access to online Social Security records, and 
 
3. providing credit monitoring and pursuing additional technologies, such as the use of video, as another method to improve service and eliminate these types of errors in the future. 
 
Anyone who has received someone else’s information should contact their local Social Security office immediately and the officials there will provide guidance. The SSA office locator can be found at https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp or contact the Charlotte Social Security Office by telephone at 888-383-1598. 
 
For reference, you can read the article and my call for an investigation HERE.

2/10/21 19:13,Newsletter: Honoring Gun Violence Survivors,"
￼

Dear friends,
 
This past week, we honored National Gun Violence Survivors Week in remembrance of all those who went through the grueling trauma – both mental and physical – at the hands of senseless gun violence. Gun violence has dramatically impacted my home state of Florida: the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, the Parkland High School shooting in Parkland, in recent news, the shootout that resulted in two slain FBI agents and 3 wounded individuals in Sunrise, FL, and countless other tragedies. 
￼

Click above for the National Gun Violence Survivors Week speech

While we honor and mourn those who lost their lives, often lost in the conversation are the survivors who struggle with their stories and can often times have difficulties finding access to affordable counseling. Their voices must be elevated, and I appreciate all the work my colleagues and advocacy groups across the nation have done to bring these brave survivors into the light.
 
Sincerely,
Carlos A. Gimenez

Committee Work Begins: Gimenez Demands Clarity on China

On Wednesday, Congressman Carlos A. Gimenez joined Todd Piro and Jillian Mele on Fox and Friends First to discuss a letter from House Homeland Security Committee Republicans to National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan demanding clarity on President Biden’s policy on China. 
￼

Click above to watch the Fox and Friends First interview

In the letter, Gimenez and House Homeland Security Committee Republicans point to a non-committal answer from Biden’s nominee for Secretary of the Department of Commerce, Governor Gina Raimondo, on whether Huawei will remain on the Department of Commerce’s Entity List as an example of inconsistencies in policies and views on China from the Biden administration.  

The lawmakers “remain troubled that you have not yet provided definitive clarity on how the administration plans on continuing the productive measures from the last four years to protect our homeland from this far-reaching CCP threat,” according to the letter.
 
The letter comes on the same day Gimenez called on the Biden administration to ignore calls from the Chinese Communist Party to ramp down the aggressive posture taken by the Trump administration. 

Gimenez Votes to Support Liz Cheney as House Republican Conference Chairwoman

Congressman Carlos A. Gimenez voted in support of House Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney during the conference-wide vote of confidence in her leadership position. 
￼

Gimenez said that despite the two of them disagreeing on the vote to impeach former President Donald Trump, he believes the Republican Party is better served when dissenting opinions are allowed to be openly debated.
 
“I joined the majority of Republicans in affirming our confidence in Liz Cheney as conference chair. She is a strong and steadfast leader of the conservative agenda, exactly who we need to help us lead. Our party is best served when we can have open and honest discussions,” Gimenez said in a statement.
 
Gimenez had been one of Cheney’s most vocal supporters since she came under fire from the right flanks of the Republican Party. Cheney successfully retained her chairmanship with 145 House Republicans voting in her favor and 61 voting against.

Gimenez Votes to Remove Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green from Committee Assignments

On Thursday, Congressman Carlos A. Gimenez joined South Florida Republicans in voting to remove Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene from her committee assignments. The house resolution came weeks after a 2018 video of Greene emerged of her harassing Parkland High School shooting survivor David Hogg outside the Capitol building. That same week, a CNN report uncovered posts and videos made by Greene peddling other conspiracy theories about mass shootings and making anti-Semitic remarks. 

Gimenez joined CNN’s Wolf Blitzer on Friday to explain his vote.  
￼

Click above to watch the CNN interview on last week's vote

After the vote, Gimenez said he voted to remove Congresswoman Greene from her committees to show that her comments and behavior should not be tolerated. “When she goes after students, victims, and survivors of senseless gun violence as in the case of the Parkland High School shooting, she loses all credibility as someone assigned to crafting policies in protection of our children from violence. We cannot allow Congresswoman Greene’s comments and behavior to prevent us from governing responsibly,” Gimenez said.
 
Following the vote, Gimenez called on House Democrats to hold all Members of Congress to the same standard.
￼

Click above to watch the CNN interview on last week's vote

“Now that this high standard has been set, I call on Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats to review and heavily weigh the consequences of similar anti-Semitic, conspiratorial, and violence-invoking comments made by House Democrats. Too often, Democratic Members of Congress are let off the hook when deeply hurtful comments are swept under the rug for the sake of political expedience,” he concluded in his statement.

2/11/21 11:47,"Proposed Rule Reduces Wildfires, Supports Conservation and Creates Jobs","￼ 
Contacts:   Marty Cozza (Risch)  Harry Fones (Rosendale)
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
February 11, 2021 
Proposed Rule Reduces Wildfires, Supports Conservation and Creates Jobs 
WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho) and U.S. Representative Matt Rosendale (R-Mont.) today led a bicameral letter to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in support of a proposed rule to reduce roadblocks created by the Cottonwood decision and help spur responsible forest management and conservation projects on federal lands.
Specifically, the proposed rule will release the Forest Service from reinitiating consultation with FWS on ready-to-go land management projects every time “new information” is found about possible impacts on endangered species, reigniting a cycle of red tape and activist litigation.
“The proposed rule will allow land managers and wildlife biologists to follow the best-available science for consultation,” the letter read in part. “It will remove an ambiguity in current regulations that have led to more lawsuits than conservation work. This rule is critical to improve the health of our nation’s forests, advance wildlife restoration projects, reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires, and support timber jobs.”
In addition to Risch and Rosendale, signers of the letter include U.S. Senators Steve Daines (R-Mont.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.), Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.), and John Barrasso (R-Wyo.), and U.S. Representatives Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), Russ Fulcher (R-Idaho), Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.), Yvette Herrell (R-N.M.), and Jim Baird (R-Ind.).
Background: In 2015, the Ninth Circuit Court ruled in Cottonwood Environmental Law Center v. United States Forest Service (Cottonwood)  that the U.S. Forest Service needed to reinitiate consultation with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at the programmatic level following the 2009 designation of critical habitat for the Canada lynx. As a result, courts halted projects during the consultation process throughout the 18 national forests inhabited by lynx. In 2018, a partial legislative fix was achieved, but “new information” claims under the Cottonwood ruling continue to have damaging implications for forests across the West.
Last year, Daines, Risch, and others introduced legislation to provide a legislative fix to the misguided Cottonwood decision and ensure continued responsible forest management on federal lands.
Read the  full letter here or below:
Dear Mr. Frazer and Mr. Rauch, 
We write today in support of the proposed rule published on January 12, 2021 to amend the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service (the Services) interagency Section 7 consultation regulations under the Endangered Species Act. The proposed revision would clarify consultation obligations for finalized forest and land management plans. We urge you to finalize this rule in order to preserve the land planning process, re-establish consistency within land management agencies, remove any ambiguity that could be exploited in litigation, and ensure the Services’ time and resources are not further diverted from critical wildlife conservation work. 
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals’ ruled in Cottonwood Environmental Law Center v. United States Forest Service (Cottonwood) that a completed Forest Plan was an action of which the agency retained discretionary authority and control. This decision established a new, ambiguous, ungrounded threshold for Section 7 consultation on completed programmatic actions, effectively setting a litigation trap for the Forest Service and subjugating the agency to a never-ending procedural exercise. 
The decision has tied the hands of land managers and wildlife biologists in the Ninth Circuit, preventing the best available science from driving decisions and has created inconsistency with agencies outside of the Ninth Circuit. Since January 2016, there have been at least 28 lawsuits and 50 notices of intent (NOIs) to sue the Forest Service involving ESA new information claims, challenging both plan-level and project-level decisions. This has blocked essential forest restoration projects from moving forward putting communities and wildlife at risk and costing thousands of jobs. One Cottonwood lawsuit in 2019 shutdown all logging and thinning, timber sales, and prescribed burns in all of New Mexico’s Forests and almost stopped the Capitol Christmas Tree from being cut out of the Carson National Forest. The New Mexico forests were the victims of inconsistency, since New Mexico is in the Tenth Circuit, which has rejected Cottonwood, while the suit was filed within the Ninth Circuit in Arizona. 
The proposed rule would fix this issue by clarifying that reinitiation of consultation is not required for previously-approved BLM and FS land management plans when new information reveals that effects of a plan may affect listed species or critical habitat in a manner or to an extent not previously considered, provided that any authorized actions for which the new information is relevant will be addressed through a separate action-specific consultation. 
While this rule was initiated by the Trump Administration, the position it establishes was supported by the last two Democratic Administrations. In 1995, the Clinton Administration submitted a petition for writ of certiorari in Pacific Rivers Council v. Thomas arguing that “the mere existence of a plan is not [an] ‘action’ within the meaning of Section 7(a)(2) of the ESA, and Section 7(a)(2) does not in any event require the Forest Service to consult about forest plans themselves, so long as it otherwise fulfills its duty to insure that site-specific activities are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or adversely affect their critical habitat.” Similarly, the Obama Administration’s 2016 petition for writ of certiorari stated that the Cottonwood decision “has the potential to cripple the Forest Service and BLM’s land management functions and to impose substantial and unwarranted burdens on FWS and NMFS.” 
The proposed rule will allow land managers and wildlife biologists to follow the best-available science for consultation. It will remove an ambiguity in current regulations that have led to more lawsuits than conservation work. This rule is critical to improve the health of our nation’s forests, advance wildlife restoration projects, reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfires, and support timber jobs. We respectfully urge you to maintain the position of the past two Democratic Administrations and finalize this rule.

￼
￼
￼

Dear Lindsey,

Early last month, I was sworn in as your representative in the 117th Congress. Since then, I have been hard at work fighting for our values and working for the needs of Alabama's First Congressional District. I wanted to update you on a few of the things I have done in Congress, including protecting and defending our border security, fighting for small business owners and American workers, promoting clean energy, and protecting the unborn.

I am excited to serve on the House Committee on Natural Resources in the 117th Congress, where I have the opportunity to oversee offshore energy production, protect and expand land for recreational hunting and fishing, manage and sustain our oceans and fisheries, advocate for our timberlands, and oversee tribal lands. Coastal Alabama benefits greatly from offshore energy production, and that's why I've joined my colleagues in pushing back on many of President Biden's executive orders harming our energy independence and eliminating Alabama jobs.

Last week, I was appointed to the House Armed Services Committee, which is a huge deal for our district and the state of Alabama. Whether it's Austal Shipyard in Mobile, Fort Rucker in the Wiregrass, Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base in Montgomery, or Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama's contribution to our nation's military strength and defense programs is critical to national security. I'm grateful for this opportunity to support our men and women in uniform, while further strengthening the military and defense footprint of our state and nation.

Border security is a critical component of our national security, and I am committed to making sure we uphold our immigration laws. Border security is always important, but it is more important now than ever as we battle the COVID pandemic and work to minimize the spread of the virus. President Biden has been attempting to weaken our immigration laws, so I've taken action such as co-sponsoring Rep. Yvette Herrell's PAUSE Act, which maintains our border security by preventing unfettered entry at the border while Americans are facing lockdowns and stay-at-home orders due to the COVID pandemic.

I have also taken several steps to fight for life, including co-sponsoring more than a dozen pro-life bills. Last week, I gave a speech on the House floor in honor of the millions of babies who lost their chance at life because of Roe v. Wade. Life is a precious gift from God, and every human is made in God's image. I'm proud to be a pro-life leader in Congress, and I believe it is our duty as a society to promote a culture that values life.

Numerous challenges, both short-term and long-term, are facing our state and nation, but I am confident that we will overcome them and emerge stronger than before. I am working hard for you every day in Washington, and I am proud to represent you. If I or my office can ever be of service to you, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.

Sincerely,

￼

Jerry Carl
Member of Congress

Beatty Bill Protects the People’s Right to Vote  The Save Voters Act will target aggressive voter purge efforts like those in the State of Ohio
U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03), Chair of the powerful Congressional Black Caucus, introduced today the Save Voters Act, a piece of legislation to prohibit states from using the same type of questionable voter purge tactics that Ohio has used to take tens of thousands of eligible voters off the voting rolls.  “The right to vote is not a ‘use-it or lose-it’ proposition. Rather, voting is a permanent guarantee that is the very lifeblood of our nation,” Beatty said. “To sit back and allow that right to be restricted or removed over something as minor as failing to respond to a postcard is unthinkable, especially when it is particularly harmful for communities of color, veterans, and vulnerable populations.” She continued, “As the Representative of Ohio’s Third Congressional District and Congressional Black Caucus Chair, I will continue to do everything in my power toward making it easier—not harder—for people to vote.”  “After record levels of voter turnout during a global pandemic, it’s appalling that Republicans are trying to make voting harder, especially for many Black and brown voters,” Karen Hobert Flynn, President of Common Cause, said. “Americans who chose not to vote during the pandemic should not be potentially purged from the voter rolls, and we commend Congresswoman Beatty for introducing the Save Voters Act to help protect the voices of all eligible voters.”  Specifically, the Save Voters Act would bar states from purging potential voters based on their failure to vote or respond to a written notice, unless the notice is returned as undeliverable. The bill also requires that a state must inform a voter when they are removed from the rolls and include the reason for removal and information on how to contest removal or be reinstated. Further, states would need to disseminate a public notice within 48 hours of conducting any general program to remove names from the official list of eligible voters, informing the public that list maintenance is taking place and that registrants should check their voter status.

Espaillat and García Introduce Resolution Categorizing the Proud Boys’ actions at the United States Capitol as an act of Domestic Terrorism

Members Express Concerns Proud Boys Pose Clear And Present Danger As Insider Threat To The Nation


WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Representatives Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) and Jesús G. ""Chuy"" García (IL-04) released the following statement regarding the introduction of their resolution in the House, which expresses the Sense of Congress that the Proud Boys engaged in acts of domestic terrorism at the U.S. Capitol, urges the Department of Justice, state, and local law enforcement entities to recognize the threat posed by the Proud Boys and white supremacists and to intensify efforts to hold the Proud Boys accountable for their discriminatory and violent acts:

“The Proud Boys have a very clear brand: domestic terrorism, which was on full display at the United States Capitol on January 6th, prompting Canada, one of our nation’s closest allies to formally tag them as a terrorist organization. As detailed in press accounts and federal complaints against Proud Boy members, the group played a leading role in the insurrection on the Capitol, which led to the death of five people, including members of the United States Capitol Police force,” said Rep. Adriano Espaillat (NY-13). “Given the violent, extremist ideology of the Proud Boys organization, which is arranged into chapters under one brand and a leadership structure, it is essential that the House formally express its belief that the Proud Boys have operated as domestic terrorists and pose an imminent insider threat to communities across the country and to our democracy.” 

“Let me be clear—on January 6, the Proud Boys helped coordinate an act of domestic terrorism when they joined a violent mob that stormed the U.S. Capitol,” said Rep. Jesús G. “Chuy” García (IL-04). “The Proud Boys’ actions fit the FBI definition of domestic terrorism: they commit violent, criminal acts to promote their far-right ideology. It’s time to call them what they are and hold them accountable.”

“Members and leaders of the Proud Boys have repeatedly embraced and advanced antisemitic, racist, and violent rhetoric, and their role in helping to instigate and carry out the attempted insurrection of January 6 further reveals this event’s foundation in dangerous extremism. If our nation is to ever eliminate this kind of destructive hate, it is critical that Members of Congress unequivocally condemn the Proud Boys’ behavior in the clear and strong language that Reps. Espaillat and García have proposed,” said ADL CEO and National Director Jonathan Greenblatt.

Representative Espaillat is the first Dominican American to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives and his congressional district includes Harlem, East Harlem, West Harlem, Hamilton Heights, Washington Heights, Inwood, Marble Hill and the north-west Bronx.

He is also a member of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC), where he serves as the Second Vice Chair and is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, where he serves as Deputy Whip. Representative Espaillat also currently serves as a Senior Whip of the Democratic Caucus. To find out more about Rep. Espaillat, visit online at https://espaillat.house.gov/.



Espaillat y García introducen una resolución que categoriza las acciones de los Proud Boys en el Capitolio de los Estados Unidos como un acto de terrorismo doméstico

Los miembros expresan su preocupación de que los Proud Boys representan un peligro claro e inminente de amenaza interna para la nación


WASHINGTON, DC – Hoy, los congresistas Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) y Jesús G. ""Chuy"" García (IL-04) emitieron el siguiente comunicado sobre la introducción de su resolución en la Cámara, que expresa el Sentido del Congreso de que los Proud Boys cometieron actos de terrorismo doméstico en el Capitolio de los EE.UU., insta al Departamento de Justicia, a las entidades policiales estatales y locales a reconocer la amenaza que representan los Proud Boys y los supremacistas blancos, y pide intensificar los esfuerzos para hacer rendir cuentas a los Proud Boys por sus actos discriminatorios y violentos:

“Los Proud Boys tienen una marca muy clara: terrorismo doméstico, el cual estuvo en plena exhibición en el Capitolio de los Estados Unidos el 6 de enero, lo que llevó a Canadá, uno de los aliados más cercanos de nuestra nación, a etiquetarlos formalmente como una organización terrorista. Como se detalla en los informes de prensa y las quejas federales contra los miembros de los Proud Boy, el grupo jugó un papel de liderazgo en la insurrección en el Capitolio, que provocó la muerte de cinco personas, incluidos miembros de la fuerza policial del Capitolio de los Estados Unidos”, dijo el Rep. Adriano. Espaillat (NY-13). “Dada la ideología violenta y extremista de la organización Proud Boys, que está organizada en capítulos bajo una marca y una estructura de liderazgo, es esencial que la Cámara exprese formalmente su creencia de que los Proud Boys han operado como terroristas domésticos y representan una amenaza interna inminente para las comunidades de todo el país y para nuestra democracia”.

“Permítanme ser claro: el 6 de enero, los Proud Boys ayudaron a coordinar un acto de terrorismo doméstico cuando se unieron a la turba violenta que irrumpió en el Capitolio de los Estados Unidos”, dijo el Rep. Jesús G. “Chuy” García (IL-04). “Las acciones de los Proud Boys se ajustan a la definición del FBI de terrorismo doméstico: cometen actos criminales violentos para promover su ideología de extrema derecha. Es hora de llamarlos por lo que son y hacerlos rendir cuentas"".

“Los miembros y líderes de los Proud Boys han acogido y promovido repetidamente la retórica antisemita, racista y violenta, y su papel para ayudar a instigar y llevar a cabo el intento de insurrección del 6 de enero revela aún más que la base de este evento en un extremismo peligroso. Si nuestra nación va a eliminar alguna vez este tipo de odio destructivo, es fundamental que los miembros del Congreso condenen inequívocamente el comportamiento de los Proud Boys en el lenguaje claro y fuerte que han propuesto los congresistas Espaillat y García”, dijo el CEO y director nacional de ADL, Jonathan. Greenblatt.

Our office has received many inquiries about Economic Impact Payments (EIP). We understand that it has been frustrating for constituents who believe they were eligible for either or both rounds of EIPs but have not received a payment, or have received the incorrect amount. Congress intended these payments to provide immediate relief to individuals and families struggling during the pandemic. My team and I have pressed the IRS to address these problems, continue making eligibility determinations, and issue outstanding payments.
Some of the more common issues highlighted by constituents that would fall into this category include:
	•	Taxpayers whose income was higher in 2018 than 2019 and were determined to be ineligible or eligible for a smaller payment 
	•	Individuals who were claimed as dependents in 2018 but filed on their own in 2019 
	•	Taxpayers who were given a May 22nd payment date but the payment did not arrive 
	•	Taxpayers who now reside at a different address than they did in 2018 or 2019 
	•	Couples who file taxes jointly, but only one person received the $600 2nd round payment 
However, at this point, please be advised that if you did not receive either or both of the Round 1 and Round 2 payments, or if either payment was lower than expected, the IRS has indicated that the best course of action is to claim the amount on your 2020 tax return as a Recovery Rebate Credit. We are disappointed the IRS was not able to issue your payment in time, but also want to make sure you have the information needed to claim your EIP on your upcoming tax return. 
If you did not receive your Economic Impact Payment, or received a lower amount than expected, please take the following steps to claim the funds you are owed:
	•	Confirm the total amount of EIPs you received, either through Notice 1444 and 1444-B or through your bank statements 
	•	Use the Recovery Rebate Credit Worksheet to determine the amount you are owed 
	•	Claim your Recovery Rebate Credit on Line 30 of IRS Form 1040 
 PREPARE and PROTECT LTC Acts
Last Thursday, Rep. Bill Pascrell, Jr., Senator Bob Menendez and I introduced our legislation to restore regulations regarding infection control and emergency preparedness in skilled nursing facilities and nursing facilities.
The Promoting Restoration of Emergency Preparedness and Advancing Response to Epidemics in Long-Term Care Act (PREPARE LTC Act) will require facilities to establish and maintain an infection prevention program and an emergency plan to protect residents during emergency situations. The bill prevents the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services from waiving or suspending staffing reporting and critical inspections during a pandemic. 
Last Friday, Rep. Bill Pascrell, Jr. and I reintroduced our legislation to improve oversight of long-term care facilities and protect seniors and workers. While only 0.5 percent of U.S. residents live in nursing homes, individuals in nursing homes account for more than a third of the nation’s COVID-19 deaths.
The Protecting Residents with Oversight, Transparency, and Enforcement for Compassionate Treatment in Long-Term Care (PROTECT LTC Act) provides $100 million to State Survey Agencies (SAs) to increase investigations and surveys, purchase personal protective equipment, and boost staffing levels. The bill also increases civil monetary penalties for outbreak-specific violations at nursing homes, including staff shortages, overcrowding, and insufficient PPE. 
National Apprenticeship Act
As a new member of the House Education and Labor Committee, I am excited to say I voted on Friday for the bipartisan National Apprenticeship Act to expand the Registered Apprenticeship Program, streamline access for workers and employers, and better protect apprentices. The legislation will help create an estimated one million new apprenticeship positions nationwide over the next five years. 
Apprenticeship programs create opportunities for workers to learn new skills and transition into good-paying jobs. I’ve heard from residents, labor leaders, and educators across North Jersey about how valuable apprenticeship programs are for both workers and employers, and I’m proud to support the expansion of this program with a proven track record of success.
House Global Positioning System (GPS) Caucus 
￼
I announced last week I am joining Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE) as a co-chair of the bipartisan, House Global Positioning System (GPS) Caucus. GPS technology plays an integral part in nearly every aspect of modern society but is also an essential tool for our country’s national security. As a former helicopter pilot for the U.S. Navy, I know first-hand the importance of accurate, reliable, and resilient GPS technology, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to support this critical technology. The Senate GPS Caucus is co-chaired by Senators Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) and Joni Ernst (R-IA).   

I'm incredibly honored to serve the 11th District and will continue to work hard on the issues that will move New Jersey, and this country, forward.

Veterans Newsletter, Winter 2021
Aloha, 
As we begin a new year and transition into a new administration, we have the opportunity to refocus our efforts to achieve our goals. I had the chance to meet with President Biden’s nominee to be the next Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Denis McDonough. We discussed several issues, including the challenges facing the largest integrated health care system in the country. In addition, we discussed managing employee morale, moving forward with construction projects, increasing telehealth access to rural areas, and working with the Department of Defense to improve transition services.  My colleagues and I voted on February 8 to confirm Mr. McDonough as the 11th Secretary of Veterans Affairs. The challenges facing the department are vast and I look forward to working with Secretary McDonough to address them in a collaborative way. Click here to watch my portion of Mr. McDonough’s confirmation hearing. 
 In January, members of the Hawaii National Guard mobilized almost overnight to protect our Capitol and everyone in it, and to ensure a peaceful transition of power. Upon their return, some have tested positive for COVID-19. This is a sad and troubling development.  I was grateful to be able to thank them in person before they left DC and wish all of them a full and speedy recovery.

Hirono, Ernst Bill Signed Into Law, Permanently Establishes Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative Act in Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division– Senators Mazie K. Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), and Representatives Veronica Escobar (D-Texas) and Van Taylor (R-Texas), announced that their bipartisan, bicameral legislation to permanently establish the Servicemembers and Veterans Initiative (SVI) inside the Justice Department (DOJ)'s Civil Rights Division was signed into law on January 5, 2021.   Since 2015, the SVI has coordinated and expanded DOJ’s work to enforce statutes created to protect the legal interests and rights of servicemembers and their families. In 2018, the SVI helped inform DOJ’s settlement with the City and County of Honolulu and its contracted towing company for illegally auctioning cars owned by servicemembers on deployment. Read more. 
Hirono Bill to Help VA Home Loan Recipients Rebuild After Natural Disasters Becomes Law – Senator Mazie K. Hirono, a member of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, secured a provision from her Veteran Home Loan Disaster Recovery Act in the recently-passed Johnny Isakson and David P. Roe, M.D. Veterans Health Care and Benefits Improvement Act, which became law on January 5, 2021.  The Veteran Home Loan Disaster Recovery Act was inspired by Mr. Tam Hunt, an Army veteran and Hawaii Island resident, who faced challenges financing a replacement for the home he lost in the 2018 Kilauea Volcano eruption. The eruption destroyed as many as 700 homes, including at least one home purchased using the VA Home Loan Guaranty Program. Senator Hirono’s provision would allow veterans replacing homes lost to natural disasters through the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Home Loan Guaranty Program to access a lower fee rate—as if they were a first-time participant in the program.

2/11/21 14:53,Information on the Upcoming Tax Season,"￼
￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ 
 
￼ 
Dear friend, 
As tax season approaches, I encourage each of you to take advantage of tax filing assistance for qualified taxpayers and stay informed about refundable tax credits. I am happy to provide you with the following information and resources:
You may qualify to receive tax help at no cost! The IRS offers free local help and an online service for qualified taxpayers. Additionally, you can find tax filing assistance according to your zip code through the IRS. 
If eligible, I urge you to claim your Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and Child Tax Credit (CTC). These benefits can come in handy for families!
The EITC is a refundable tax credit, meaning you do not need to owe taxes to benefit. This tax credit can provide real relief to eligible individuals and working families and could decrease the amount owed or increase their refund. 
Taxpayers with a dependent under 17 years old may be eligible for the CTC, which helps provide support to families raising a child. For help determining if you are eligible to claim the Child Tax Credit or the credit for other dependents, click here.
If you were eligible for an Economic Impact Payment (aka stimulus check), but did not receive one or you received less than the full amount as an advance payment in 2020 then you can claim the Recovery Rebate Credit on your 2020 tax return. For more information on the Recovery Rebate Credit, click here. 
All unemployment benefits are taxable income. If you receive unemployment benefits you will be issued a Form 1099-G tax statement. For more information on WI’s 1099-G form, click here. 
Workplaces are required to send W2s by mail or electronically by January 31st. If you have questions, please contact your employer. 
This year, tax season will begin on February 12th, when the tax agency will begin accepting and processing 2020 tax returns. April 15th marks the deadline for filing 2020 tax returns, requesting a filing extension, and it’s also the deadline to pay taxes owed to prevent fees from mounting up.
Your friend, 
Gwen

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Introduces Second Amendment Preservation Act (SAPA) To ELIMINATE Federal Funding For Gun Control 


Washington, D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene (GA-14) kept her campaign pledge to defend gun rights by introducing the Second Amendment Preservation Act (SAPA) to defund all federal gun control enforcement and end funding for regulation and guidance issued by the ATF. 

The Second Amendment Preservation Act (SAPA) will:

	•	Cut all federal funding from implementing, enforcing, or advancing any measure, law, regulation, or guidance relating to the lawful use, purchase, sale, possession, or transportation of firearms by any citizen of the United States for Fiscal Year 2021. 

	•	Prohibit any federal funds from enforcing or implementing regulations or guidance issued by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms promulgated after November 1, 2020. 

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene issued the following statement:

“Throughout my campaign for Congress, I promised the people of Northwest Georgia that I would be the strongest defender of gun rights on Capitol Hill. The Second Amendment Preservation Act (SAPA) prevents the federal government from using our taxpayer dollars to enforce gun control on law-abiding Americans. 

Our God-given right to protect our country, ourselves and our families shouldn't be up for debate. I’m proud to introduce this legislation, endorsed by the American Firearms Association, that will defund the enforcement of tyrannical gun control laws.” 

Congressmen Paul Gosar (AZ-4), Randy Weber (TX-14), Scott Perry (PA-10), Madison Cawthorn (NC-11), Thomas Massie (KY-4), Chip Roy (TX-21), Ted Budd (NC-13), Jody Hice (GA-10), Andy Biggs (AZ-5), and Warren Davidson (OH-8) have joined Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene (GA-14) as cosponsors of SAPA.

2/11/21 16:21,ICYMI: Sen. Rick Scott is Fighting to Preserve Florida’s Environment for Future Generations,"￼ 
￼￼￼￼ 
In Case You Missed It!
U.S. Sen. Rick Scott is Fighting to Preserve Florida’s Environment for Future Generations
￼
Throughout his eight years as Governor of Florida and now as U.S. Senator, Rick Scott has made protecting Florida’s environment one of his top priorities. During his time as Governor, Florida’s annual investments to preserve the environment increased by $1 billion. The Senator has kept this focus in Washington by championing $250 million for Everglades Restoration in the 2021 federal budget and keeping oil drilling away from Florida’s coasts. This Congress, the Senator has championed several pieces of legislation to continue protecting Florida’s beauty for future generations. 
Learn more on how Senator Scott is working to protect Florida’s natural resources below. 
￼
Senators Rick Scott, Marco Rubio Introduce Legislation to Protect the Eastern Gulf of Mexico From Drilling 
Last month, Senator Rick Scott and Senator Marco Rubio re-introduced the Florida Shores Protection and Fairness Act, which would extend the moratorium on oil and gas drilling in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico from 2022 to 2032. This bill would help solidify the progress made by President Trump’s September 2020 executive actions to protect Florida’s shores.  Senator Rick Scott said, “As Governor of Florida, I fought for and secured a commitment from the Trump Administration to keep oil drilling off Florida’s coasts, and I’m glad they extended the moratorium on oil drilling for another 10 years. I’m proud to join Senator Rubio to put this ban into law. We will never stop fighting to preserve and protect Florida’s natural resources so the state can remain a top destination for families, visitors and businesses.""  Read more from Senator Rubio’s office HERE. 
 
Senators Rick Scott, Rubio, Schatz and Hirono Introduce Restoring Resilient Reefs Act  
Last month, Senator Rick Scott joined Senators Marco Rubio, Brian Schatz and Mazie Hirono to reintroduce the bipartisan Restoring Resilient Reefs Act, which would reauthorize and modernize the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000 and strengthen NOAA’s Coral Reef program.   Senator Rick Scott said, “During my time as Governor of Florida, we worked to increase investments in our environment by $1 billion to preserve and protect our natural resources. I’m proud to join Senators Rubio, Hirono and Schatz to reintroduce the Restoring Resilient Reefs Act, which will build on our efforts and help restore and protect our coral reef ecosystems. I will continue working to make sure future generations can enjoy all that Florida has to offer.""  Read more from Senator Rubio’s office HERE. 
 
Senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio Reintroduce Bill to Address Harmful Algal Blooms in South Florida 
Last month, Senator Rick Scott joined Senator Marco Rubio and Congressmen Brian Mast and Darren Soto to reintroduce the South Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act, legislation that would direct the Interagency Task Force on Harmful Algal Blooms to assess the causes and consequences of the blooms in Lake Okeechobee and around Florida’s southern coastlines identify needed resources, and develop a plan of action to address these challenges.   Senator Rick Scott said, “As Governor and now as Senator, I’ve worked with leaders across our state to address the harmful algal blooms that plague Florida’s waters. I’m proud to join Senator Rubio to build on these efforts by reintroducing the South Florida Clean Coastal Waters Act to expand research and our understanding of blue-green algae and red tide. We must keep working to protect Florida’s beautiful waters, environment and natural resources for future generations.""  Read more from Senator Rubio’s office HERE. 
 
Senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio Highlight Florida Wins in U.S. Army Corps of Engineers FY 2021 Work Plan 
Last month, Senator Rick Scott and Senator Marco Rubio applauded the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for supporting Florida’s priorities in their Fiscal Year 2021 work plan, which includes funding for water resource projects and builds on the progress towards the restoration of Florida’s Everglades through projects like the Central Everglades Planning Project (CEPP). This announcement follows Senator Scott and Senator Rubio’s letter to R.D. James, the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, outlining their priorities for the work plan.    Senator Rick Scott said, “I’m glad to see the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers prioritize many Florida projects in their upcoming work plan, including funding for Everglades restoration projects. These important projects will build on our efforts to protect our environment and ensure future generations can enjoy all our state has to offer.”    Read more from Senator Rubio’s office HERE.

Rounds Report: $15 Minimum Wage Would Cost Jobs 
February 11, 2021 
As a former governor and business owner, I understand how important economic policies are in making sure businesses have opportunities to grow and create jobs.   President Biden continues to embrace a radical left-wing agenda by pushing policies like a $15 federal minimum wage, which would damage our economy. This week, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released a report detailing the economic impact of increasing the minimum wage to $15. According to the CBO report, an estimated 1.4 million American jobs would be destroyed and $70 billion would be added to the national debt.  In South Dakota, I’ve already talked to several small business owners who have indicated they will be forced to cut staff just to stay open should this drastic hike to the minimum wage take place.  We are in the middle of a pandemic. Our businesses have faced enough hardship already. We don’t need to add additional injury. Our goal should be to enact business-friendly policies that promote economic growth and job creation.

Democrats Leave Texas Workers in the Dust
 
 
In his first two weeks in office, President Biden has launched two direct attacks on Texas oil and gas workers. First, he killed the important Keystone XL pipeline, then he banned new oil and gas leasing on federal lands. And now, he’s trying to force a mandated minimum wage that will hurt small businesses. 
 
As a direct result of Biden’s actions, millions of Americans are facing the loss of their good-paying jobs – many of them here in Texas.
 
That’s why today, I introduced an amendment to the Democrats’ 1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package that would provide assistance for the workers left unemployed as a result of President Biden’s executive orders and minimum wage mandate. Democrats’ rejected it.
 
￼
WATCH: Congressman Brady introduces an amendment to help Texas workers 
 
These workers have bills due now, they have kids going to college now, and they can’t buy groceries now as a direct result of President Biden’s policies. And still, Democrats refuse to help. 
 
This heartless decision has made it clear that House Democrats and the Biden Administration are more concerned with catering to their far-left base than helping out-of-work Americans.
Don't take my word for it – take theirs.

WATCH: House Ways and Means Committee Democrats vote to reject Congressman Brady's amendment to help unemployed workers.

2/11/21 16:51,Baldwin Introduces Bipartisan Medicaid Reentry Act,"

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
This week, Senator Baldwin along with Senators Mike Braun (R-IN), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) are leading the Senate introduction of the bipartisan Medicaid Reentry Act, legislation expanding access to addiction treatment and other health services for Medicaid-eligible individuals 30 days before their release from jail or prison. The bipartisan legislation is also being re-introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressmen Paul Tonko (D-NY-20) and Michael Turner (R-OH-10).  Currently, federal statute prohibits any form of federal health coverage for incarcerated individuals except under very limited circumstances. In most states, Medicaid coverage is immediately terminated when someone is sent to a correctional setting. This creates a serious coverage gap when individuals are released, as they often have no access to health care or addiction treatment during a stressful and dangerous time. This bill is a bipartisan response to this issue, following alarming evidence published in the New England Journal of Medicine that individuals reentering society are 129 times likelier than the general population to die of a drug overdose during the first two weeks after release. 
“The opioid and substance use disorder epidemic remains rampant in Wisconsin and across the country, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic is dramatically impacting the addiction prevention, treatment, and recovery landscape in this country. This problem is harshly affecting incarcerated individuals who are working to reenter society, but currently lack the health care coverage they need to continue their recovery,” said Senator Baldwin. “We need to make sure these rehabilitated folks have Medicaid or other health care coverage needed to seamlessly transition back to community care, and reduce the risk of overdose deaths post-release. I’m proud to work with my Senate and House colleagues on this bipartisan reform to address our nation’s addiction crisis and support our continued fight against this deadly epidemic.” 
Specifically, the bipartisan Medicaid Reentry Act will: 
	•	Grant new flexibility to restart benefits for Medicaid-eligible incarcerated individuals 30 days pre-release;
	•	Make it easier for states to coordinate effective addiction treatment and other health services, allowing for a warm handoff to community care and a reduced risk of overdose deaths post-release; and
	•	Ensure a smooth transition back to Medicaid for those who are already eligible for Medicaid coverage.
In Wisconsin, Senator Baldwin’s bipartisan Medicaid Reentry Act has earned the support of Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley and Dane County Sheriff Dave Mahoney. 
“The Medicaid Reentry Act is an important piece of legislation that can save lives through continued coverage of effective addiction treatment options for individuals reentering the community,” said Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley. “The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified the unique vulnerabilities individuals facing substance use disorder face upon release. In December, Milwaukee County saw a 108 percent increase in calls into Emergency Medical Services related to overdoses compared to 2019 - with more than 40 percent of those calls coming from Black residents – capping a tragic, year-long trend of increasing overdose calls to EMS in 2020. The data underscores the immediate need for legislation to help ensure uninterrupted and compressive coverage is available to our most vulnerable residents.”    Dane County Sheriff Dave Mahoney, who is also President of the National Sheriffs Association, said he was pleased to lend the Sheriffs’ strong support of The Medicaid Reentry Act.  
“This legislation will allow Medicaid to cover the last thirty days of medical assistance for incarcerated individuals. This is an important part of the continuum of care for those with medical needs.  In the long run this will reduce recidivism and therefore ease budgetary burdens from the jail system. Our taxpayers deserve that,” said Sheriff Mahoney. 
Read more about Senator Baldwin's bipartisan Medicaid Reentry Act and see why a broad coalition of national organizations support the bill, including A New PATH (Parents for Addiction Treatment & Healing), American Jail Association, The American Osteopathic Academy of Addiction Medicine, American Psychiatric Association, American Psychological Association, American Society of Addiction Medicine, The Association for Behavioral Health and Wellness, Central City Concern, CleanSlate Centers, Community Catalyst, Community Oriented Correctional Health Services (COCHS), HIV Medicine Association, International Community Corrections Association, The Kennedy Forum, Legal Action Center, Major County Sheriffs of America (MCSA), McShin Foundation, National Association of Counties (NACo), National Association for Behavioral Healthcare, National Council for Behavioral Health, National Association of Social Workers (NASW), National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), National Health Care for the Homeless Council, The National Safety Council, National Sheriffs Association, Shatterproof, The Student Coalition on Addiction (SCA), Treatment Communities of America, Well Being Trust, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America here.

Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 2.11.21
Thursday, February 11, 2021 –                                 
Get Students Back in School
Barbara Mandrell once sang, “I was country, when country wasn't cool.” I understood what she meant recently on a different topic: resuming in-person learning at schools.
I have been calling for schools to reopen since last summer. Now, the Biden Administration indicates it is moving in that direction. Further, on February 5 Governor Northam issued a statement urging the same outcome, calling on Virginia’s K-12 schools to plan for in-person learning options by March 15.
I am glad to see the governor join this effort. Reopening schools is in the best interest of students and their families. It is supported by scientific data and expert opinion.
For example, in a June 23, 2020 hearing of the Energy and Commerce Committee on responding to the coronavirus pandemic, then-Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Dr. Robert Redfield said reopening schools would be a “jurisdiction to jurisdiction decision” and that the CDC would roll out guidelines for doing so safely.
Also, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said much the same.
Having participated in this hearing and listening to these comments, I introduced a resolution a few days later urging that schools be allowed to decide whether to return in person at the local level. I knew this was an important issue for Virginia’s Ninth Congressional District, which had remote learning imposed on it by the Commonwealth even though its COVID infection rates at the time were much lower than in other parts of Virginia.
More than six months later, President Biden’s new Director of the CDC, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, told reporters at a White House briefing, “There is increasing data to suggest that schools can safely reopen and that safe reopening does not suggest that teachers need to be vaccinated.”
These voices support calls from the American Academy of Pediatrics from last summer strongly urging the resumption of in-person learning for the health and well-being of children. It has noted the lower rates of virus transmission among young people and the importance being in school has on childhood development. Among the benefits provided by being in school: “social and emotional skills; safety; reliable nutrition; physical/occupational/speech therapy; mental health services; health services; and opportunities for physical activity.”
Remote learning options – when they are feasible, which is questionable for areas lacking broadband access – simply do not provide the full range of benefits for the well-being of children, including their mental health.
A recent article from the news outlet Axios puts numbers on some of the harm caused by the lack of in-person learning. American students from kindergarten to fifth grade have lost an average of 20 percent of reading skills and 33 percent of math skills compared to what they would have normally learned. An economic analysis puts the long-term damage to the U.S. economy at $14 trillion to $28 trillion.
These numbers astound but still cannot fully convey the damage that lack of in-person learning inflicts on children. Some things cannot be quantified, like the impact on mental health or the socialization that comes when students are around their peers.
Worst of all, indicators such as a doubled suicide rate among teens and children in Clark County, Nevada, during nine months of the pandemic compared to the entire previous year show still more tragic consequence.
Reopening schools does not mean returning exactly as they operated before. Each school district of course must adjust appropriate to its circumstances regarding social distancing, allowances for teachers, staff, and students who may be in a high-risk category for contracting the virus, and other necessities imposed by the pandemic.
One approach could be to have the students in the classroom supervised in person by a teacher’s aide who is not in a high-risk category and does not have comorbidities, while a teacher with a higher risk status could be “Zoomed” into the classroom.
President Biden said after the presidential election that he wanted the majority of schools open by the end of his first 100 days in office. His press secretary on February 9, unfortunately, lowered the bar, saying that this pledge merely meant ""teaching at least one day a week in the majority of schools by day 100.""
That’s not good enough. The science has been clear since last summer.
Returning to in-person learning will have difficulties, but the far greater costs of not doing so have been clear. Also clear is the relatively lower rate of transmitting the coronavirus among young people. This should not be a close call.

2/11/21 17:56,Weber Statement on 117th Congress Committee Assignments,"

For Immediate Release

Weber Statement on 117th Congress Committee Assignments
Washington, D.C. – Thursday, February 11, 2021, U.S. Rep. Randy Weber (TX-14) issued the following statement on committee assignments for the 117th Congress. Rep. Weber will continue to serve on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Energy, while also continuing on the House Transportation and Infrastructure (T&I) Committee, with subcommittee assignments to: Water Resources and Environment; Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation; and Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials. 
“My district on the Gulf Coast of Texas is one of the biggest energy producers in America, so I am proud to serve once again as the Ranking Member of the Energy Subcommittee, as well as continue our important work on House T&I. Both committees mean a great deal to my district.
“At the beginning of the last Congress, I committed to focusing—in a bipartisan fashion—on reauthorizations and continued oversight of the Department of Energy (DoE).  It is an honor to be asked to continue to serve in this role and remain focused on this. Although we succeeded in passing the Energy Act of 2020, the first major update of America’s energy policy in 13 years, we have more work to do.
“My goal is to ensure the research, development, and demonstration programs authorized at DoE are quickly implemented and responsibly conducted. This will modernize our energy sector and keep prices low for consumers, without relinquishing global leadership to China and Russia. I thank the full committee’s Ranking Member Frank Lucas for his leadership and for his trust in me to guide these efforts. The future is bright for U.S. energy independence and innovation!"" said Congressman Weber.
“Ranking Member Weber has done great work as our Ranking Member on the Energy Subcommittee,” Lucas said. “He’s been a strong supporter of cutting-edge energy technologies like next-generation nuclear and advanced geothermal, as well as the fundamental research needed to make our energy portfolio cleaner, more affordable, and more secure. His leadership will be critical as we continue to grow America’s energy production.”
Weber went on to note that, “This will be my third Congress as a member of the T&I Committee, an assignment that is very beneficial for our district.  The Water Resources Subcommittee exercises jurisdiction over the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, whose mission is critical for Gulf Coast infrastructure, and with their district headquarters in Galveston, they are also valued constituents.  Likewise, we have a number of U.S. Coast Guard personnel assigned to the Coast Guard stations in Texas-14, so being on Coast Guard & Maritime Transportation has been an excellent platform to look out for our Coasties and their families.  By the same token, with the Texas A&M Maritime Academy (also located in Galveston), that subcommittee has been key to securing a new training ship for our future merchant mariners.  And finally, given the significant pipeline and railroad networks that are so critical to southeast Texas’ petrochemical industry, I am particularly thankful to work on the Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials subcommittee.”

2/11/21 18:06,IMPEACHMENT...AGAIN!,"
￼ 
IMPEACHMENT… AGAIN
Dear Friends,
If you’ve turned on the news this week, you have likely caught Congressional Democrats’ latest political theater: the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump. Even now, while the trial is still underway, it’s already clear that Democrats will lack the votes needed to convict the former President on the charge he “incited an insurrection” on January 6, 2021.
First, I believe – as do many Senate Republicans – that it is unconstitutional to impeach a private citizen. Our Founding Fathers deliberately designed impeachment to be a solemn last resort to remove an official from office. Impeachment should not be weaponized into a partisan tactic to be used routinely against political opponents. Furthermore, it should not be used to prevent someone from potentially running for office in the future. This trial is a fundamental misuse of impeachment.
Second, more and more reports have shown that the Capitol riot was planned and coordinated by extremist militia groups far in advance, and that federal law enforcement issued warnings (that appear to have been completely ignored by authorities at the Capitol) in the days leading up to January 6. As we get a clearer picture of the events, the claim by Democrats that Trump’s speech is entirely to blame for the riot falls flat on its face.
Lastly, if Democrats want to criminalize inflammatory political rhetoric, they should begin by taking a long hard look in the mirror. Many high-profile Democrats have themselves made violent and hateful remarks equal to anything Trump said on January 6. For example, Congresswoman Maxine Waters openly encouraged people to aggressively assault Trump supporters. Senator Bernie Sanders inspired a gunman to attack a group of House Republicans, severely wounding Congressman Steve Scalise. The Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, labeled all Republicans as “domestic enemies.” I could go on and on.
I have forcefully condemned the Capitol riot – just as I condemn all political violence. Those responsible must be held accountable. However, that’s not what this impeachment is all about.
Rather than turn their attention to any of the real and urgent challenges facing Americans, Democrats have opted to spend their first weeks in control of Washington to turn the January 6 riot to their own political advantage. I hope this parody comes to a swift end with a full acquittal so we can get to work on things that will actually benefit Americans!

Biden's Open Borders
Earlier this week, I joined 50 of my House Republican colleagues in signing onto a letter led by my friend Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), urging President Biden to reconsider the immigration Executive Orders he signed on his first day of office. These new Executive Orders put our Border Patrol agents at high risk, while granting false hope to thousands of illegal immigrants who make the dangerous trek to our border.
Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents have already seen the average daily rate of illegal immigrants crossing the border soar to more than 3,500 migrants – up from the 2,000 they saw last month. That includes over 300 unaccompanied minors illegally entering our borders per day. These immigrants are being sold a false narrative that they are welcome to come here without following our laws, going through the legal process and waiting in line with many others to become a legal citizen. 
We know where these “open borders” policies take us. Under the Obama-Biden Administration, Democrats incentivized illegal immigration while simultaneously handcuffing border enforcement, causing a massive border crisis. One aspect of the crisis was the surge of unaccompanied children coming across our border, which led to them being corralled behind chain link fences or “cages” in 2014. Consistently applying our immigration laws will lead to better organization at our border and will prevent chaotic situations like the one that led to families being separated.
Legal immigration is fundamental to the success and character of our nation, but I am absolutely opposed to illegal immigration. Illegal immigrants who bypass legal points of entry and are granted de facto amnesty by the Biden Administration cut ahead of hundreds of thousands of lawful immigrants who have been patiently waiting to enter the United States.
Crippling our border security and putting the lives of our Border Patrol agents in danger is not a political game, and our country’s national security is not to be toyed with. President Biden should be more focused on protecting the safety of American citizens instead of appeasing his own extremist “open borders” supporters.
You can read the entire text of the letter here.

Where to get the COVID-19 Vaccine in Georgia
The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) report that 34.7 million Americans have already received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and over 11 million people have been fully vaccinated. In Georgia, the vaccine is becoming more available as Governor Brian Kemp today shared the news that CVS Pharmacies will begin accepting appointments at 12 locations across the state!
Our state is currently in Phase 1A, which means health workers, long-term care facility staff and residents, adults age 65 or above and their caregivers, and first responders are all eligible for the vaccine.
You can register now for a CVS vaccine by visiting this website or calling (800) 746-7287.  Please note that you must make an appointment in advance! Vaccines are also available through Kroger, Publix, Ingles, and Walmart. To find even more locations or learn about the vaccine, visit the Georgia Department of Public Health's website.

Get to Know the Freedom Caucus!
I’m honored to serve as the Communications Chair for the House Freedom Caucus, where I work alongside some of the most dedicated patriots serving in Congress. We actively fight to give a voice to countless Americans who feel that Washington does not represent them.  The Freedom Caucus supports open, accountable and limited government, the Constitution and the rule of law, as well as policies that promote the liberty, safety and prosperity of all Americans. Over the next few months, the Freedom Caucus will be releasing regular profile videos of its members. You can watch mine and get to know a little bit more about me by clicking on the video below. I highly suggest you follow them on Facebook, Twitter as well!

￼
During the 117th Congress, I am greatly honored to continue serving on behalf of the Fourth District of Oklahoma in the U.S. House of Representatives. In the coming days, I look forward to getting to work in my committees and advocating for Oklahoma’s conservative values and the needs of our communities.

While members of the new Congress were officially sworn in on January 3, legislative and committee work in the House has only recently begun in earnest since committee assignments were finalized just a couple weeks ago. Going into this term, I am proud to continue serving as Ranking Member of the House Rules Committee, which is an important procedural panel that considers every major piece of legislation before it reaches the House floor. Additionally, I will remain on the House Appropriations Committee, where I will continue serving as Vice Ranking Member of the full committee and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies and as a member of the Defense Subcommittee.

Read on for additional updates on the new Congress as well as my thoughts on the first days of the Biden Administration, following the presidential inauguration on January 20.
 
Tune In: Weekly Chats
￼
In case you missed it, last week I filmed my first Weekly Chat video of the year and talked about recent legislation brought to the floor of the House as well as the status of additional coronavirus relief and the Democratic party's attempt to make that relief package partisan. Considering that Congress worked across the aisle and across the Capitol to deliver five bipartisan relief packages for the American people last year, I am very disappointed that Democrats are aiming to use a politically convenient budget maneuver to go it alone now. 

During my recent Weekly Chat, I also discussed my thoughts on the first days of the Biden Administration and his ever-growing list of executive orders that have been signed largely to appease the most radical wing of his party. 

As I did throughout the last Congress, I will continue to provide these regular video updates about the latest votes and news of importance to the Fourth District of Oklahoma. Stay tuned by following my social media channels (Facebook, Twitter or YouTube) or by visiting my website here. 

First Impressions of the Biden Administration 
The recent inauguration of President Joe Biden marked the peaceful transfer of power, symbolizing that our unique government institutions and systems are still intact. During the next four years, I hope to cooperate with the Biden Administration when and where possible, but I will certainly not withhold criticism of damaging policies that will further divide the country or circumvent bipartisan debate and action in Congress.

Indeed, there are many areas where Republicans and Democrats can and should work together immediately. Most urgent, Congress and the Biden Administration must address the lingering consequences of the coronavirus pandemic and continue working toward defeating it entirely. Although President Biden signaled his desire to deliver solutions and additional relief by issuing and signing an executive order related to the pandemic, that is no substitute for congressional action that is bipartisan. Indeed, Congress should prioritize bipartisan relief for the Americans still struggling and strengthen support for vaccine distribution in communities across the country. Sadly, Democrats in Congress are already pushing ahead in a partisan manner on that front.

“Governing” by the Pen 
Since President Biden was sworn into office, he has signed a flurry of executive orders in an attempt to undo many policies of the previous administration. In fact, he has issued more executive orders than any other new president in American history. Alarmingly, many of the actions seek to dismantle existing policy on energy development and climate, foreign relations and immigration. While I understand that the Biden Administration is seeking to plot a path forward, governing by use of a pen – rather than in collaboration with the legislative branch – is not the way to lead our country or usher in lasting solutions. Moreover, it will sow greater division nationwide rather than pave the way for the “unity” President Biden promised to foster for the American people.

Considering that legislative work in Congress has only recently gotten underway and since the Democratic Party, to which President Biden belongs, holds the majority in both chambers, it is baffling that the president has opted to act on his own so fast and soon. Indeed, by doing so, he has effectively signaled that he does not care to wait on lawmakers to deliver the radical policies he wants.

In terms of the executive orders related to energy development, one of President Biden’s first moves was cancellation of the Keystone XL pipeline construction. This hasty decision has not only disrupted local economies, but it immediately jeopardized thousands of American jobs. Similarly, President Biden placed a moratorium on new oil, gas and coal leasing on federal lands. While federal lands make up only 20 percent of the land mass in our state, many oil and gas companies based in Oklahoma rely on working federal lands in other areas of the United States. As a result, this misguided moratorium on new leases will directly limit the ability of our oil and gas producers to search for and use new oil reserves, costing thousands of U.S. jobs and dangerously weakening America’s oil independence and energy security.

Indeed, relying on foreign countries for oil will only raise the prices of gasoline and utilities for all Americans and at a time when people are already struggling to get by amid the pandemic. Rather than increasing bills for Americans during these challenging times, President Biden and Congress should be working together to rebuild our economy and restore our way of life. Eliminating jobs and increasing utility costs is the opposite outcome President Biden should be dealing.

I am also disappointed by President Biden’s decision to unilaterally have America rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement, without any negotiation or debate in Congress. This action is severely misguided because it locks in inequitable mandates that favor China at the expense of U.S. jobs and energy independence. It also puts American energy supply at the mercy of foreign countries that do not have our nation’s best interests at heart. While I believe that climate change is real, addressing it should be done in a way that is internationally equitable and does not cost millions of U.S. jobs or put America’s hard-won energy independence at risk.

Finally, President Biden has taken the wrong approach on immigration policy. For example, another one of his executive orders banned for 100 days deportation of those who entered our country illegally, including known criminals. In addition, he has halted the construction underway on our southern border wall. While barriers are not the only answer to fixing our broken immigration system, it does assist the men and women of our border security and help slow and stop the illegal flow of drug and human trafficking into our country. I regret that President Biden is choosing to abandon this important tool.

While President Biden promised to unite the country, the substance of his executive orders thus far contradict that promise. Unifying the country and getting work done for the American people is more important than ever, and he should allow and encourage lawmakers to negotiate and bring fair legislation to his desk to be signed into law. That is the way our founding fathers intended for our system to work: cooperation where there is consensus and bipartisan but vigorous debate and compromise where there is not.

Unfortunately, as long as the president makes unilateral decisions to appease the far-left wing of the Democratic party, our country will only become more divided. After four years of unprecedented worldwide peace, and, before the coronavirus crisis, a robust economy, I am dismayed to that instead of working with Republicans to keep this momentum going and repair our economy, President Biden is moving forward with executive orders that will harm the long-term interests of our country.

We Must Protect Life 
￼
When our forefathers penned the Declaration of Independence that led to the establishment of our nation, they made a point to mention that all people are “endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,” including the precious right to life. Indeed, I believe there is no cause greater for any Member of Congress than defending life, especially for the most vulnerable Americans. And throughout my service in the House, I have made this one of my top priorities.

As a member of the Pro-Life Caucus, I am very proud of my 100 percent pro-life voting record and unwavering A+ rating from the Susan B. Anthony National Pro-Life Scorecard, for consistently voting for legislation to defend the lives of unborn children. While I recognize that the issue of abortion is an emotionally charged issue in our society and many Americans have differing points of view, I will always come down firmly on the side of protecting and saving the lives of unborn children as well as defending the conscience rights of American taxpayers.

In recent months, House Democrats have begun a misguided effort to dismantle a longstanding agreement, known as the Hyde Amendment, that protects life and prevents federal taxpayer-funded abortions. Since it was first enacted in 1976, it is estimated that this provision has saved more than two million lives. Moreover, it has been supported by lawmakers and signed into law by presidents of both parties every year as part of appropriations bills. When he was serving in the United States Senate, President Biden at the time expressed his support for inclusion of this provision. Indeed, it stabilizes the appropriations process, as many lawmakers – even those who are pro-abortion – will not vote for a bill if it does not include the Hyde Amendment.

Finally, the Hyde Amendment protects the conscience rights of the great majority of Americans who are opposed to publicly funded abortions for religious, moral or fiscal reasons. Repealing the Hyde Amendment would impose a pro-abortion-funding policy on states that have decided against it. The Hyde Amendment allows states to choose to fund elective abortions or not with state taxpayer dollars, and the people and elected representatives of 34 states have voluntarily chosen not to do so.

Gutting a provision that has been included in appropriations bills for nearly 50 years is certainly overreach from the far left. I vehemently oppose such efforts to repeal the Hyde Amendment and other pro-life provisions traditionally included in funding legislation. In response, I proudly signed a letter last month sent by 200 House Republicans to congressional leadership, pledging to oppose any federal government funding bill that would weaken or eliminate longstanding pro-life protections.

As I continue to represent the Fourth District of Oklahoma, I remain committed to being a voice for the most vulnerable, including unborn children. I will continue to stand with my Republican colleagues in defending life, whether those individuals are unborn or born. 
 

Stay Informed 
While social distancing prevents us all from interacting in person as much as I'd like, there are several ways I am aiming to keep you informed. This Congress, I will continue regularly filming video updates for social media, hosting telephone town halls and participating in virtual meetings reaching Fourth District communities. You can also call my office at (405) 329-6500.

If you have additional questions or need assistance with another matter, my staff can help you with that, too.

Opposing Democrats’ FY 2021 Budget Resolution
(February 3, 2021)
I am very disappointed that Democrats chose to race ahead with a budget resolution that never even saw the light of day in the House Budget Committee. With Democrats now holding an albeit slim majority in both chambers, the budget is suddenly a means to ram through their partisan priorities and go it alone on additional coronavirus relief.

Joining in Introduction of Bipartisan Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act 2.0
(January 28, 2021)
If enacted, the Gabriella Miller Kids First Research Act 2.0 would expand funding for childhood diseases by redirecting existing monetary penalties levied against pharmaceutical, dietary supplements and cosmetics manufacturers toward valuable research. By doing this, we can hopefully uncover links between childhood cancer and birth defects and save the lives of children.

Opposing President Biden’s Destructive Energy Policies
(January 27, 2021)
Within the first week of Joe Biden’s presidency, he dealt harmful blows to our oil, gas and coal industries. In one of his first executive orders after he took the oath of office, he hastily canceled the Keystone XL pipeline, which immediately disrupted local economies and destroyed American jobs. Continuing down the same destructive path for the future of U.S. energy development, President Biden laid out plans that will stop oil, gas and coal leasing on federal lands.

Responding to President Biden’s First Actions in Office
(January 21, 2021)
The executive orders that President Biden signed during his first day in office were a mixed bag. Some, especially those related to the pandemic, ought to be supported and accompanied by additional legislation. Others are largely symbolic and are simply sops to various Democratically aligned special interest groups. But several of President Biden’s orders are dangerous and damaging to the long-term national interests of the United States. They must be vigorously opposed in Congress.

HONORING A FALLEN U.S. HERO
￼
Last week, we honored the life and bravery of fallen U.S. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick as he was lain in honor in the Rotunda. Officer Sicknick tragically succumbed to injuries sustained in the line of duty on January 6, 2021. In one of our nation's darkest hours, he will forever be remembered as an American hero. Indeed, I personally owe an eternal debt of gratitude to the men and women in blue, who risked their lives to protect lawmakers, staff and other personnel in the Capitol building.

My Investigation Into Toxic Metals In Baby Food
As Chairman of the Oversight Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy, I’ve been investigating the safety of baby food, and I was shocked to find dangerous levels of toxic heavy metals in leading brands. The toxic metals found in these baby foods include arsenic, lead, cadmium, and mercury which can endanger the neurological development and long-term brain function of infants. We found that some of the baby food products had 91 times to 177 times the FDA’s maximum allowable level of arsenic and lead, respectively, for bottled water. This is due to a practice of industry self-regulation and inadequate safety standards.
Our children deserve better, and parents need to trust that the food they buy off the shelves is safe. I am pressing the FDA to enhance regulation, compliance requirements, and mandatory consumer labels on baby food, and I am also writing legislation to ensure that baby food no longer has dangerous levels of toxic metals.

My New Position As Vice Chair Of The Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus
I am proud to announce that I’ve been named as a Vice Chair of the Congressional LGBTQ+ Equality Caucus. This is a caucus of more than 150 members of Congress that aims to fight for LGBTQ+ rights and representation. In this role, I will continue to advocate for the LGBTQ+ community and end discriminatory policies. As part of that effort, I’ve introduced the STOP Bullying Act, which would create anti-bullying task forces in states to ensure the protection of all students including LGBTQ+ youth. I worked closely with GLSEN and other civil and human rights advocacy organizations on this bill and am looking forward to continuing to work on it.

Standing Up For Our Children, Fighting For Our Families

By Representative Adriano Espaillat

Original Article Published in Patch.com
February 11, 2021


￼

2020 was a rough year for our nation, and in particular, for our children. The coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout closed their schools, pushed more than 2 million of them into poverty, sent record numbers of them to bed hungry, and affected every aspect of their social and emotional lives. 

In Congress, some of my colleagues and I worked hard to mitigate these effects on our children. We introduced or supported key pieces of legislation on children’s health insurance, hunger, homelessness, tax credits, treatment of immigrant children, and other issues critical to advancing the needs of our kids and families.

For these efforts, the bipartisan advocacy organization First Focus Campaign for Children recently named me a 2020 Champion for Children. The nonprofit’s 2020 Legislative Scorecard recognizes 120 lawmakers across both parties and chambers who have worked to prioritize children.

Awards are nice. They make us feel good. And they can signal to our constituents that perhaps we are getting things done. But the work behind this award is what really matters.

During these extraordinary times amid COVID-19, families really didn’t have a choice but to opt out of in-person instruction and choose remote learning full-time. The transition has been undoubtedly difficult, so I joined efforts with New York City’s Department of Education to help close the digital divide which is core to the systemic and institutional inequity that threatens the prosperity of our communities, an inequity further exacerbated by COVID-19. Through our efforts, we were able to successfully distribute over 70,000 devices to students across each of the school districts within New York’s 13th congressional district. 

Once students received their devices, my office understood that parents were struggling with the various remote learning platforms. As a solution, my team worked once again with the City’s Department of Education to create a 10-week program to provide weekly remote learning support workshops for parents and caregivers. These weekly sessions will cover a range of topics, including best practices to navigate remote learning for students with disabilities, multilingual learners, and more topics in both English and Spanish.

Additionally, as part of my legislative efforts in Washington, during the end of the 116th legislative calendar, I was able to successfully help secure an extra $2.5 million for WIC’s Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program as part of the House Appropriations bill. We must continue such efforts to increase funding for vital programs that support Women and Infant Children by helping those with WIC program nutrition assistance purchase fresh produce from locally sourced farmers markets. Furthermore, I have long fought in opposition to the now-former Trump Administration on its harmful Public Charge Rule, which had terrible chilling effects on immigrant families’ access to public services. Thankfully, the Biden Administration is now reviewing the rule and moving forward to undo this terrible assault on immigrant families.

These are just a few of my efforts to ensure support and protections for children and families. Children in all parts of our country need more attention than lawmakers traditionally have given them. Children make up one-quarter of our population, but we spend just 7.48% of the federal budget on them, even as the global pandemic threatens to reverse economic gains made since the Great Recession.

Research from the nonpartisan Opportunity Insights project suggests that for every dollar invested in children, our nation gets $1.47 back. Yet the share of federal spending on kids has declined 9% over the last five fiscal years.

This trend must not continue. It is up to us – members of Congress – and the public that supports us, to demand that we put “the best interest of the child” first. Only when we do that, will we finally, truly put the best interest of our country first.

Defendiendo a nuestros Niños, Luchando por nuestras Familias
Por el congresista Adriano Espaillat  Artículo original publicado en Patch.com 11 de febrero de 2021 

El 2020 fue un año duro para nuestra nación y, en particular, para nuestros niños. La pandemia del coronavirus y sus consecuencias económicas cerraron sus escuelas, empujó a más de 2 millones de ellos a la pobreza, envió a un número récord de ellos a la cama con hambre y afectó todos los aspectos de su vida social y emocional.

En el Congreso, algunos de mis colegas y yo trabajamos arduamente para mitigar estos efectos en nuestros niños. Introdujimos o apoyamos leyes clave sobre el seguro médico de los niños, el hambre, la falta de vivienda, los créditos fiscales, el tratamiento de los niños inmigrantes y otros temas críticos para avanzar en suplir las necesidades de nuestros niños y familias.

Por estos esfuerzos, la organización de defensa bipartidista First Focus Campaign for Children recientemente me nombró Champion for Children 2020 (Defesor de los Niños 2020). La Tarjeta de Puntuación Legislativa 2020 de la organización sin fines de lucro reconoce a 120 legisladores de ambos partidos y cámaras que han trabajado para dar prioridad a los niños.

Los premios son agradables. Nos hacen sentir bien. Y pueden indicar a nuestros constituyentes que tal vez estamos logrando que las cosas se hagan. Pero el trabajo detrás de este premio es lo que realmente importa.

Durante estos tiempos extraordinarios en medio del COVID-19, las familias realmente no tuvieron más remedio que optar por no recibir instrucción en persona y elegir el aprendizaje remoto a tiempo completo. La transición ha sido indudablemente difícil, por lo que uní esfuerzos con el Departamento de Educación de la Ciudad de Nueva York para ayudar a cerrar la brecha digital que es fundamental para evitar la inequidad sistémica e institucional que amenaza la prosperidad de nuestras comunidades, una inequidad agravada por el COVID-19. Gracias a nuestros esfuerzos, pudimos distribuir con éxito más de 70,000 dispositivos a los estudiantes en cada uno de los distritos escolares dentro del distrito congresual 13 de Nueva York.

Una vez que los estudiantes recibieron sus dispositivos, mi oficina entendió que los padres estaban teniendo dificultades con las diversas plataformas de aprendizaje remoto. Como solución, mi equipo trabajó una vez más con el Departamento de Educación de la Ciudad para crear un programa de 10 semanas para brindar talleres semanales de apoyo al aprendizaje remoto para padres y cuidadores. Estas sesiones semanales cubrirán una variedad de temas, incluidas las mejores prácticas para navegar el aprendizaje remoto para estudiantes con discapacidades, estudiantes multilingües y otros temas tanto en inglés como en español.

Además, como parte de mis esfuerzos legislativos en Washington, durante el final del 116º calendario legislativo, pude ayudar con éxito a asegurar $2.5 millones adicionales para el Programa de Nutrición del Mercado de Agricultores de WIC como parte del proyecto de ley de Apropiaciones de la Cámara. Debemos continuar con esos esfuerzos para aumentar los fondos para programas vitales que apoyan a mujeres y bebés, ayudando a quienes reciben asistencia nutricional del programa WIC a comprar productos frescos de los mercados de agricultores de origen local. Además, he luchado durante mucho tiempo en oposición a la ahora ex Administración Trump por su dañina Regla de Carga Pública, que tuvo terribles efectos en el acceso de las familias inmigrantes a los servicios públicos. Afortunadamente, la Administración Biden ahora está revisando la regla y avanzando para deshacer este terrible asalto a las familias inmigrantes.

Estos son solo algunos de mis esfuerzos para garantizar el apoyo y la protección de los niños y las familias. Los niños de todas partes de nuestro país necesitan más atención de la que tradicionalmente les han prestado los legisladores. Los niños constituyen una cuarta parte de nuestra población, pero gastamos solo el 7.48% del presupuesto federal en ellos, incluso cuando la pandemia mundial amenaza con revertir los avances económicos obtenidos desde la Gran Recesión.

La investigación del proyecto no partidista Opportunity Insights sugiere que por cada dólar invertido en los niños, nuestra nación recupera $1.47. Sin embargo, la proporción del gasto federal en niños ha disminuido un 9% durante los últimos cinco años fiscales.

Esta tendencia no debe continuar. Depende de nosotros, los miembros del Congreso, y del público que nos apoya, exigir que pongamos en primer lugar “los mejores intereses del niño”. Solo cuando hagamos eso, final y verdaderamente pondremos los mejores intereses de nuestro país en primer lugar.

￼ 
Dear Lindsey,

In my most recent survey, most of my constituents indicated that COVID-19 vaccine distribution was a top concern they wanted Congress to address.  While I do not have control over the state's distribution plan, I have been working in a bipartisan manner to help increase the number of vaccine doses Florida receives each week and we are starting to see those numbers climb. The good news is that Florida has already vaccinated approximately 2 million seniors which is more than 35% of the state's total population of seniors. This is an impressive statistic and a big step in the right direction. However, we need to continually improve our distribution plan to ensure all seniors and vulnerable patients, especially those who are homebound, can get vaccinated. To help facilitate progress in achieving that goal, I regularly share feedback from my constituents with the state and local officials responsible for distribution plans. I will continue to do so. I appreciate your input on this topic which will be used to guide my work in the future.  

 
Take this survey
 

 
Sincerely,
 
Congressman Gus Bilirakis

Matt's Weekly Memo
 
  
Dear Lindsey,  Earlier this week, I asked people across Northeastern Pennsylvania to tell me if you were having issues with your mail delivery. The response has been overwhelming. I heard from over 7,000 of you, and you told me that shipments of your essential prescription medication is coming later than it should. You told me that worsening service quality is hurting your small businesses, as your products are arriving late or getting lost in transit. You told me that you're incurring late fees because your bills aren't getting where they need to go on time, and so much more. This poor level of service is unacceptable, and it has gone on for too long.
 
Yesterday, I called on President Biden to nominate qualified leaders to fill the three vacancies on the USPS Board of Governors -- leaders who will take seriously their responsibility to ensure the Postal Service delivers for Americans.
 
As for the sitting board members? Well, I encourage the President to take a hard look at their records and dismiss those who do not share the goal of promoting reliable and efficient mail service.
 
People's lives and livelihoods depend on the USPS, and that's why I'm fighting to restore it.

Relief for Hospitality & Tourism Businesses
 
  
Northeastern Pennsylvania’s restaurant and hospitality businesses are part of what makes our area so special. They are where we all come together to catch up with old friends, sample some great locally brewed beer, or celebrate special occasions, and we should make sure they can survive through to the end of this crisis.  
 
That's why several members of the Pennsylvania Congressional delegation and I urged House leadership to include provisions from the RESTAURANTS Act in the COVID-19 relief package being developed in Congress. Small and independently owned restaurants and their employees are among the hardest hit by this pandemic, and this legislation would provide aid to meet their unique needs and ensure they can survive this crisis.

Hi there, 
 I am getting ready to head back to the district from a week filled with committee meetings in DC.   The House Judiciary Committee hosted a series of subcommittee hearings yesterday, where I advocated for private student loan companies to stop predatory lending practices and assisted with oversight efforts as we work to undo the damage done to our immigration system by the previous administration. I also joined my Philadelphia Congressional Delegation colleagues in sending a letter to the CDC demanding that Philadelphia receive equitable distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine (read our letter here).   This week was also an emotional one as my colleagues -- the House Impeachment Managers -- presented the House's case to the Senate, laying out the facts in clear and explicit detail as to why Donald J. Trump must be convicted for his role in inciting the 1/6 attack on our Capitol. I shared my experience from the day of the attack here. As the newly appointed Vice-Chair of the Committee on House Administration, I will be working with the committee on its evaluation of this attack and the next steps.   As we close out this week, I wanted to take a moment to share with all of you a quick note about a few upcoming tele-town halls that we are hosting next week! I hope that you can join us!   Tele-Town Halls Week of February 15th

Don't Mess With Texas Energy

This week, our District welcomed Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Congressman Bruce Westerman, Republican Leader of the House Committee on Natural Resources, to show them first-hand how our critical oil and gas infrastructure is produced, introduce them to the first-class oil & gas workers who make it happen, and hear them speak on the importance of protecting our energy independence. 

￼
￼

￼
￼

Our District is home to the Permian Basin, the epicenter of oil & gas production which keeps our nation from being cold, dark, and hungry. The industry supports 2 million jobs in Texas and 10 million jobs nationwide. We have 200,000 energy workers in our district alone whose livelihoods depend on the oil & gas sector. The Biden Administration believes energy workers can find new jobs—Leader McCarthy, Congressman Westerman, and I believe energy workers are the backbone to this great country and should be protected.

Not to mention, energy security is national security—the Biden Administration’s environmental extremist policies are not only hostile to the millions of jobs reliant on American energy but are making our country increasingly dependent on unstable foreign oil. A nation that relies on its own citizens for energy is inherently safer—the President’s policies are threatening our energy independence, and therefore threatening our security. 

WATCH a recap of the rig tour and my remarks afterwards: 
￼

I cannot thank Diamondback Energy enough for hosting us, and Leader McCarthy and Congressman Westerman for joining in me in the heart of the Permian Basin to reaffirm our commitment to stand up for American energy workers. American and Texas jobs are on the line—we will not stop going to bat for the millions of workers who are kept up at night for fear of losing their jobs to the President’s out-of-touch policies. Through our voice, our vote, and legislation, we will not allow the Biden Administration to steamroll our energy security.

Home in the 11th District

This week, I had the pleasure of meeting the elected officials, community leaders, healthcare professionals, citizen soldiers, and small businesses owners who are making a huge impact on our District. 
￼

I had the honor of meeting the brave and selfless citizen soldiers stationed here at Camp Bowie in Brownwood. On Texas' worst days, the Texas National Guard is there. 

Any Texas Guardsman who is deployed overseas comes through Camp Bowie, and multiple agencies utilize the camp’s resources to make Texas and the country safer. Thank you to General Greg Chaney and the rest of your amazing team for the informative tour and for the work you do to secure our state and nation.

This week, I was called to serve on the Subcommittee on Europe, Energy, the Environment and Cyber and the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere, Civilian Security, Migration, and International Economic Policy on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 

I could not be more thrilled the represent District 11 on these fantastic subcommittees tasked with defending our nation’s security and making sure America remains a global superpower. Both of these subcommittees will tackle important issues in cyber security, economic stability, energy independence, border security, and countering hostile foreign adversaries. 

I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure America remains the safest, most prosperous nation in the world.

Letter to Governor Greg Abbott

I joined my Texas colleagues in sending a letter to Governor Greg Abbott supporting his executive action directing state agencies to challenge any federal directive that threatens Texas’ critical energy infrastructure. Texas must be able to defend itself from big government overreach and defend the livelihoods of the 2 million energy workers currently residing in Texas.

Signed on to Meaningful Legislation

Global War on Terrorism Memorial Location Act
Sponsored by Rep. Jack Crow (CO-6) and Rep. Mike Gallagher (WI-08) This bill would declare the placement of the Global War on Terrorism Memorial in the National Mall to honor the sacrifice and service of those who stopped at nothing to end tyranny and terrorism.  

Thank you for reading. It is the honor of my lifetime to serve you in Congress. Please follow me on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter for daily updates.

Message from the Representative

Dear Community Members of NY-14,

On Monday, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and I went to Corona, Queens to announce that we secured relief for funeral expenses.  Soon, low-income families will be able to apply for retroactive reimbursements to cover the cost of burying their loved ones lost to COVID-19. These reimbursements will be retroactive to January 2020.  

This issue was first raised to me by a community organization - Elmcor - and we pushed the Trump administration on this issue for over a year. We finally secured the funding in the COVID relief package that passed in December. We expect the federal government to begin accepting applications for funeral relief shortly.  In the meantime, if you want to apply for reimbursement, you should collect documentation verifying your identity and relation to the deceased; get a death certificate that lists the death as related to COVID-19; and collect receipts for costs associated with the funeral.  Only one relation to the deceased will be able to apply, and at this time that relative must be a citizen or legal U.S. resident, so please coordinate with your family to decide who that will be.

We know this only begins to get at the support our community needs. In D.C., negotiations continue over President Biden’s first COVID relief bill.  We expect the bill will contain $1400 stimulus checks and an extension of unemployment benefits through at least March. You can learn more about it here.  Please know that I share many of your frustrations over the fact that the stimulus checks will not be $2,000.  I firmly believe that Democrats’ first legislative act, now that we have the majority, should be big, bold and strong --- and I will continue to advocate for just that. 

In other COVID-19 news, we held our monthly town hall on Tuesday on the coronavirus vaccine.  We were joined by City and State representatives and, together, we outlined ongoing efforts to increase the number of vaccines available and to ensure the existing vaccines are distributed to the hardest hit areas. Just last weekend, we worked with the State to bring a pop-up vaccine site to our district, at the First Baptist Church in Queens.   A recap of the town hall, including resources on where to sign up for the vaccine if you’re eligible, is below.  You can also watch the town hall in English and Spanish on our YouTube page. 

The second impeachment trial of former President Trump also began this week.  I continue to believe that accountability for the attack on the Capitol is absolutely essential for our nation to heal, which is why I voted with my Democratic House Members and several Republicans to impeach the President last month.  It is also with accountability in mind that I’ve chosen to share publicly the details of my experience at the Capitol on January 6.  Disappointingly, though not surprisingly, the right-wing media and even some Members of Congress have chosen to attack me for speaking out.  Numerous independent media organizations have found the hateful comments made by these conservative commentators and Members to be false (see here, here). 

As always, please do not hesitate to contact our office if we can be of any assistance.  You can reach our office by sending a message HERE or by calling 718-662-5970. We are also regularly sharing resources and information at our @RepAOC Twitter, Instagram and Facebook accounts.  

In service,

Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez



FAQs from February’s Town Hall
On Tuesday, February 9, we held a town hall meeting to discuss the coronavirus vaccine. You can see the full town hall, in English and in Spanish, on our YouTube page. We’ve also included some frequently asked questions and answers below.  

Who is eligible for a vaccine?
The vaccine is  eligible to the groups found at this link, regardless of immigration status. Additionally, no immigration or citizenship information will be collected at the vaccine site.

How much do vaccines cost?
Vaccines are free of charge.

How do I schedule a vaccine? How do I get scheduled at Citi Field or Yankee Stadium?
Testing sites are run by the City and the State. You can look for availabilities near you through the following numbers and websites: 

	•	City vaccine sites, including Citi Field: Vaccinefinder.nyc.gov, call 1-800-VAX-NYC4 (1-800-829-6924). Please note the Citi Field site will serve eligible Queens residents, along with priority appointments for TLC and food service workers from across the five boroughs.  

	•	State: am-i-eligible.covid19vaccine.health.ny.gov/ or call 1-833-NYS-4-VAX (1-833-697-4829) 

	•	Yankee Stadium: SomosVaccinations.com, 1-833-SOMOSNY 

Are vaccines safe and effective? Especially given the new COVID variants?
Overwhelmingly yes.  Numerous independent studies have found the vaccine to be effective to various COVID-19 variants. Millions of people across the globe have also now received the vaccine, including the Congresswoman, and nearly all have experienced no or mild side effects, like fatigue or soreness at the injection site. Those with severe allergic reactions should speak with their doctor prior to getting the vaccine. More information is available here. 

The next eligible group for vaccination is for people who are immunocompromised or who have preexisting conditions. Do these folks need to wait until 2/15 to start calling for an appointment or can they call now to schedule appointments for 2/15 and beyond?
You can call to start scheduling appointments on February 14 but no appointment will be scheduled until February 15. Here’s a list of eligible pre-existing conditions and the documentation required for this group.

Do I still have to wear a mask after I get the vaccine?
Yes! You will need to continue to wear a mask, practice social distancing and good hand hygiene for the foreseeable future as the vaccine gets rolled out in phases. Experts need more time to understand the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide before deciding to change recommendations on mask use. Other factors, including how many people get vaccinated and how the virus is spreading in communities, will also affect this decision.

What is the federal government doing to increase vaccine supply? 
The Biden Administration has increased the weekly vaccine supply by 28 percent since taking office. 

The Administration has also  announced that it will deploy approximately 1,000 troops across the United States to assist with vaccination efforts.

Additionally, starting on February 11, the first phase of the federal pharmacy program launched. The effort will scale up and eventually up to 40,000 retail pharmacies, including Walgreens/ Duane Reade, Costco and Rite Aid locations, will receive doses directly from the federal government. Starting immediately, this program will increase the City’s weekly supply by approximately 20 percent. Pharmacies in New York City are currently allocating these doses for those over 65. To get schedule for one of these appointments, go to Vaccinefinder.nyc.gov. 

What is being done to ensure vaccines are distributed equitably and in NY-14? 
The Congresswoman worked with the State to bring a temporary site to First Baptist Church of E. Elmhurst - over 500 appointments were booked at the site through SOMOS in one weekend.  We have also identified for the State other possible sites for future temporary sites in our district, including the NY Hall of Science and Lehman High School Campus.

Rep. Ocasio-Cortez also signed onto Rep. Grace Meng’s letter urging Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra to make public a breakdown of already administered COVID-19 vaccines.  Presently, such data does not exist, and a breakdown would ensure that health inequities tied to the vaccine rollout are addressed.

President Biden has also established a COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force. This week, they announced that  the Administration will directly allocate vaccine doses to Federally Qualified Community Health Centers as part of an effort to administer vaccinations in the communities, which have been hardest hit by the pandemic. The first phase of the program will allocate one million doses per week to 250 Community Health Centers, with some centers receiving allocations as early as next week.

Dear Lindsey,  Thank you for following along with the progress our office is making for the taxpayers of Montana. The past two weeks have been busy in DC and I look forward to heading home to visit with the people of Montana soon. 
 
I introduced my first piece of legislation, the 'No Tax Cuts for Sanctuary Cities Act.' The legislation will amend the tax code to eliminate the tax exempt status of municipal bonds issued by sanctuary jurisdictions. 
 
My hope is that the bill will be another tool in the toolkit to deter these dangerous policies nationwide by creating a financial disincentive for sanctuary cities. Immigration is a national issue that affects all of us, and individual municipalities cannot be allowed to continue to make up their own policies in an area constitutionally reserved for Congress

I was named ranking member for the Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on Technology Modernization. The Subcommittee has oversight and investigative jurisdiction over the Department of Veterans Affairs’ major IT projects and technology modernization programs
 As ranking member for the Technology Modernization Subcommittee, I am excited to help update the delivery of veterans’ health care -- whether that be through electronic record modernization or increasing telehealth benefits
 
I co-sponsored legislation to authorize the continued construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline following the Biden Administration's executive order to kill the project. This executive order has already hurt Montana. During this time of economic uncertainty, ending American jobs and energy independence should not be President Biden's top priority.
 
The Keystone XL Pipeline provides good, high paying jobs and is a source of added revenue for our rural communities.
 
I stood up in support of telehealth and asked the Biden Administration to make permanent the flexibilities implemented under President Trump, allowing more Montanans to receive care. Telehealth services have allowed many individuals to make the best choices regarding their healthcare amid COVID-19 and it's important we keep that momentum going.

2/12/21 12:54,COVID Relief Should be Bipartisan,"￼
A Week in the Great Eight
COVID Relief Should be Bipartisan 
Dear Friend,
As President Biden abandons any attempts to work with Republican legislators on a COVID package, instead opting to advance a nearly $2 trillion partisan package, it has become painstakingly clear that the President was never sincere about his message of unity in his Inaugural address. Just last week, the President claimed it was an “easy choice” to pursue a massive package that’s entirely partisan. 
And unfortunately, we have seen the President’s partisan approach extend throughout the committee process, where House Democrats have repeatedly rejected amendments offered by Republicans that would have undeniably improved the legislation. In fact, during the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee’s markup of the transportation-related provisions included in this massive package, I offered three commonsense amendments that would benefit American workers and families. Democrats rejected my amendments. Learn more, HERE.
Congress has delivered bipartisan COVID relief as recently as this past December, and with $1.1 trillion in COVID relief funds still sitting unspent, one must ask themselves the question: why is President Biden rushing to pass $1.9 trillion more in funds? Well the answer is, unfortunately, pretty simple. Biden and his allies in Congress want to quickly pass a bloated, partisan bill containing far-left priorities that radicals in their party have been working to pass for years. 
President Biden’s partisan approach ignores the promises he made to unify this nation, but also threatens to put in place policies that could weaken our nation. Since COVID arrived on our shores, I have stated that any COVID relief package put forward should be bipartisan. I will continue to urge Biden to abandon his partisan political agenda and help us deliver thoughtful and fiscally responsible solutions that will actually help Americans during this uncertain period. 
President Biden Must Begin to Put Our Kids First
After promising to reopen schools within 100 days of taking office, Biden walked back this promise this week, giving a less ambitious goal than most parents want to hear. On Tuesday, we discovered the actual “goal” for reopening is in-person classes one day per week by April 30th. This is unacceptable. The science and CDC has made it clear that schools can safely reopen if proper precautions are taken. 
￼
As a parent, I know that in-person classes for students is both beneficial for their long-term development and for working parents attempting to navigate this difficult period. Failure to provide our children with a safe, in-person learning environment could set back an entire generation of students, particularly vulnerable students who come from low-income households that are not able to afford extra tutoring. Getting all of our kids safely back in the classroom needs to be our top priority, so I urge the White House to circle back with a more ambitious timeline. It’s time to put our kids first. 
Expanding Access to Apprenticeships 
Last week, I helped advance the National Apprenticeship Act, legislation that is estimated to create nearly one million new apprenticeship opportunities over the next five years. More specifically, this bipartisan legislation will increase access to the successful registered apprenticeship program, allowing more Americans to earn while they learn a trade. As our nation collectively works to spur economic recovery, we need to be doing everything we can to support the trades. 
￼
 Watch me speak more about this legislation, HERE.
Speaking Out Against Biden’s Job Killing Agenda
Between cancelling the Keystone XL Pipeline, rejoining the unfair Paris Climate Agreement and banning new oil and gas leases on federal lands, President Biden’s Executive Orders have already destroyed thousands of jobs, caused severe economic suffering for middle class American families, and reduced American energy independence. 
The negative ramifications of these anti jobs, anti-affordable energy Executive Orders are wide-ranging and new consequences are being brought to light every day. Here in Minnesota, for example, we are currently experiencing rising gas prices. 
As the economic fallout from Biden’s Executive Orders continue, I took to the House Floor to speak on how Biden’s bans have negative repercussions for our rural district, and districts like it. 
￼
 To listen to my remarks, click HERE.
Reintroducing the JUSTICE Act 
I was proud to recently reintroduce the JUSTICE Act, police reform legislation that will better fund training for police officers, increase the number of body cameras, and help implement community policing best practices in police departments nationwide. 
While I am proud to have reintroduced such an important piece of legislation, I am disappointed that it was not passed last Congress. Instead, Democrats continuously blocked my efforts to bring it to the House Floor, even though an overwhelming majority of the provisions included in the JUSTICE Act received bipartisan support in the past.
As the American people continue to grapple with an economic crisis and complex social issues, they are desperately calling for their leaders to work together and put forward commonsense solutions that will unify and move this nation forward. The JUSTICE Act would do just that, so I will continue to call on Congressional Democrats to help pass this critical piece of legislation. 
￼
 Read more about the JUSTICE Act, HERE. 
The Derek Chauvin trial begins in the Twin Cities next month, so I am sure there will be renewed discussions on police reform and public safety. As a former police officer, I know what it takes to keep our communities safe and I will continue to lead on these issues. To stay up to date on these discussions, along with the other work I am doing in Congress, please also visit my website, Facebook, and Twitter pages.
As always, it is an honor to represent you in Congress. 
Sincerely,
Congressman Pete Stauber

2/12/21 13:02,Blaine's Bulletin: Presidents' Day,"￼ 
February 12, 2021
For Immediate Release | Contact: Georgeanna Sullivan (202) 225-2956 

BLAINE'S BULLETIN: PRESIDENTS' DAY
Presidents’ Day was originally created to observe the birthdays of two of our nation’s greatest Presidents, George Washington and Abraham Lincoln. And while it is now more of a holiday to celebrate all Americans who have served as President, it is also a good excuse to honor the memories and contributions of these great Americans who left such lasting impacts on this country. 
To say that President George Washington is an American hero would be an understatement. Often referred to as the “Father of America,” he led our nation to independence during the Revolutionary War and played a critical role in creating our country’s government system. Not only did he help draft the Constitution, he took a young nation made up of just eleven colonies and appointed a cabinet, nominated a Supreme Court justice, established a national bank, and served two terms as President. Five more colonies joined the nation under his Presidency and after serving two terms, he stepped down to allow someone else to serve which set the precedent for Presidents throughout history. 
President Abraham Lincoln is another American figure who left a lasting legacy and played an integral role in the shaping of our nation. Serving as President during the Civil War, he was tasked with leading our country during the biggest moral dilemma America has ever been faced with. By issuing the Emancipation Proclamation, freeing all slaves and abolishing slavery for good, he ultimately brought the Union and Confederacy together and created one unified nation. President Lincoln’s life was cut short, but his years as President are some of the most consequential in our nation’s history. 
One of my favorite Presidents, Ronald Reagan, was also born in February. He was an optimist who wholeheartedly believed in this country and it showed in his policies. President Reagan is best known for putting an end to the Cold War, tearing down the Berlin Wall, historic tax reform, and the War on Drugs. Presidents’ Day is a good time to look back at our history and the many ways different Presidents have changed it and honor all 46 Presidents who have served our nation in this incredibly important position. But it is also a national holiday and a good excuse to spend time with family and children who have the day off school, perhaps in the snow after all the weather we’ve had lately. I wish you all a safe and relaxing Presidents’ Day!

Putting Americans First in American Rescue Plan House Financial Services Committee holds markup on COVID-19 relief package
U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03), Chair of the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Diversity and Inclusion, helped lead the House Financial Services Committee’s markup this week of the American Rescue Plan, a comprehensive COVID-19 relief package providing greater assistance to workers, families, and small businesses.
“The American Rescue Plan is all about meeting the moment because lives and livelihoods are on the line,” Beatty said. “This historic piece of legislation will do just that by delivering direct relief to the people immediately.” She added, “I look forward to continuing to work with the White House and congressional leadership to get the American Rescue Plan quickly signed into law so that my constituents, our economy, and nation can build back better.”
Under the Financial Services Committee’s purview, the American Rescue Plan includes:
	•	$25 billion in rental assistance (in addition to $25 billion previously authorized under the bipartisan Government Funding / COVID-19 Agreement).
	•	$10 billion for small business lending (expected to drive $100 billion in new investment). 
	•	$10 billion to improve production of personal protection equipment and much-needed medical supplies.
	•	$10 billion for homeowner relief.
	•	$5 billion to better assist individuals experiencing homelessness or at-risk of homelessness.

COMMITTEE UPDATE 
Week in Review 
This week, I enjoyed spending time in Antrim and Grand Traverse Counties, and even had the opportunity to meet with Elk Rapids High School students who won the Congressional App Challenge. Each year, our office hosts several challenges in which First District students are invited to compete. The App Challenge offers students an opportunity to work together, learn to code, and even pursue careers in computer science.
On Thursday, I was appointed to lead the VA Subcommittee on Health by Ranking Member Mike Bost. The Subcommittee on Health’s responsibilities include oversight of medical services, research, facilities, and compliance at the Veterans’ Health Administration. When it comes to delivery of health care, access and accountability are critical issues that impact Veterans across our district and throughout our Nation. I'm grateful for this opportunity to continue fighting for our Veterans in this new leadership position. Typically, the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs has been one of the most bipartisan bodies in Congress. The past two years has been the exception, and unfortunately, this week we continued to walk down that path. Yesterday in Committee, I offered an amendment to increase funding for key mental health programs for our Veterans and expand access to counseling and peer support - however, House Democrats voted it down, on a purely partisan basis.
Unity is much more than just a word - it's an action. If we wish to see our Nation come together and do what is right for each other, supporting our Veterans is a really good place to start - regardless of party or politics. I'm fully committed to keeping up the fight in the years ahead to ensure that those who have sacrificed so much for our country receive the care they deserve and the recognition they have earned.

I'm proud to serve the great people of the First District and I look forward to seeing you soon. 

Respectfully, 

Jack Bergman

(Washington Examiner) 'The Brink Of A Huge Humanitarian Crisis': 52 House Republicans Tell Biden To Take Border Crisis Seriously
More than 50 House Republicans accused President Biden of treating the United States-Mexico border as a ""political game"" for implementing softer immigration policies as apprehensions of illegal immigrants tick up to ""crisis"" levels.
""It is concerning to see your administration perceives our border security issues as a political game instead of the very serious threat open borders provide to Americans and the migrants seeking to come here,"" the letter states. ""This is not a political game — we implore you not let ideology blind your Administration to the need to secure the border, to defend Americans, and to prevent another cartel-empowering humanitarian crisis.""
The group asked President Biden to direct Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to brief all 435 House lawmakers on the rapidly developing situation.

(Numbers USA) Bergman Joins Rep. Chip Roy In Letter Warning Biden of Intensifying, Politics-Driven Border Surge
Earlier this week, Rep. Chip Roy, along with 51 other representatives, sent a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to address the ongoing and intensifying crisis at America’s southern border.
“We write today to bring attention to the rising illegal migration crisis that is already beginning at our southern border, a mere few weeks into your Administration.”
“Mr. President, the fundamental responsibility of the federal government is to protect America, not to ignore the law and to actively encourage, incentivize, and facilitate illegal migration in ways that empower cartels and endanger both American citizens and migrants wrongly being encouraged to succumb to the perilous journey.”

Bergman Supports Legislation Protecting Those with Pre-Existing Conditions

 Rep. Jack Bergman joined the House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Ranking Member, Cathy McMorris Rodgers, in introducing H.R. 892, the Pre-Existing Conditions Protection Act of 2021 – a bill to guarantee protections for patients with pre-existing conditions.
This legislation would ensure three key protections for those with pre-existing conditions: guaranteed access to health insurance coverage, a ban on limiting or denying employee benefits, and a prohibition on raising premiums based on pre-existing conditions. By specifically outlining these protections, H.R. 892 would help create a strong foundation for future health reform legislation.
Following the bill’s introduction, Rep. Bergman said: “Promoting access to affordable, quality healthcare has been one of my biggest priorities in Congress. Whether it’s expanding coverage for telehealth services, banning surprise medical billing, or providing emergency funding to health providers during the COVID-19 pandemic, I have worked to be a voice for Michigan patients and providers. While this is only one part of our efforts to create an effective health care system for all Americans, I am proud to join in support of this continued commitment to ensure protections for pre-existing conditions are upheld for future generations.”
H.R. 892 is also designed so these important safeguards would be protected even if future legislation or court decisions alter provisions under the Affordable Care Act. To view the bill in its entirety, click HERE.

Bergman Sends Letter To Biden Warning Against Rejoining Fatally Flawed Iran Nuclear Deal

It has come to our attention that you may be considering a re-entry to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) without first pursuing any changes to the 2015 agreement. It is critically important that you do not allow history to repeat itself with a fatally flawed Iran Nuclear Deal. For a variety of reasons that include the expiring sunset clauses and a flawed verification agreement, this would be a strategic US foreign policy blunder, exponentially more dangerous than the consequences of the original misguided approach. 

As is, this deal is not a pathway to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. It is a blueprint for exactly how Iran can secure massive sums of money and obtain a nuclear weapon in short order. Compounding the threat, this approach turns a blind eye to Iran’s non-nuclear destabilizing activities throughout the world, such as its support for international terrorism and continued development of its ballistic missile arsenal. 

The decision not to recertify the Iran Nuclear Deal in 2017 was in America’s best interests. Even if the United States never withdrew from the deal, poorly construed sunset provisions baked into the deal would now be upon us, meaning Iran would be well on its way to obtaining a nuclear weapon while having violated not only the spirit but the letter of the deal.

Bergman Signs Letter to President Biden Expressing Opposition to Executive Orders Directing Oil and Gas Leasing Moratoriums

The letter stated in part, ""This ill conceived policy will devastate a major sector of our economy while millions of Americans are unemployed due to the COVID-19 crisis. Additionally, this policy will handicap essential environmental restoration programs across the country by destroying a critical source of conservation funding: revenues from conventional energy production. 
Conserving our beautiful public lands and waters is a goal we all share. Yet we are also blessed with rich resources that we can use in safe, ecologically-conscious ways that benefit all Americans.

Bergman Joins Letter To Biden on Border Security Concerns

The Members stated, ""We are once again on the brink of a huge humanitarian crisis, endangering the lives of migrants and law enforcement officers at the hands of the violent cartels that your Administration has further empowered. Reports also indicate that Health and Human Services (HHS) is opening an overflow facility for illegal migrants apprehended at our southern border.

""Instead of finding common ground on border security issues as you once did when you voted for the “Secure Fence Act of 2006,” your solution to build more facilities that are only needed because of your recent actions, will only exacerbate the issue and further stretch resources.""

These highly-skilled SFS scholars will be ready to enter the government's cybersecurity workforce upon graduation. Michigan Tech offers a number of high-quality cybersecurity and computing degree programs and faculty actively conduct externally supported research in emerging areas including cyber-physical systems, mobile computing, and network architecture. Michigan Tech also has a long history of offering cybersecurity outreach activities to K-12 teachers and students and of providing excellent career services for college students. The SFS program will create a supportive learning community to help these students complete their college education and join the cybersecurity workforce.

Michigan Residents Have Multiple Options for Vaccine Sign-up
Recognizing that residents have varying degrees of technology access and understanding, particularly seniors 65 and older who are currently eligible to receive the vaccine, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) is collaborating with community partners to ensure that anyone can sign up to get a vaccine when it’s available to them. 
“Our goal is to ensure that every eligible Michigander who wants a vaccine will get one,” said Elizabeth Hertel, director of the MDHHS. “We know that residents across Michigan have different needs when it comes to access, so we’re partnering with groups like local health departments, hospitals, pharmacies, and 2-1-1 to provide multiple access points for signing up for a vaccine.”
All residents are encouraged to visit Michigan.gov/COVIDvaccine for the most up-to-date information about vaccine eligibility, safety information, and clinic locations. Residents who don’t have access to the internet or who struggle to use a computer can also call the COVID-19 Hotline at 888-535-6136, which is available Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Local health departments and hospitals across the state have created sign ups, interest forms and waitlists, based on eligibility per the Michigan COVID-19 Vaccine Prioritization Guidance and will contact residents to schedule appointments as supply allows. Residents may also contact additional vaccination sites as they start to come online, such as local pharmacies like Meijer and others.
For residents that do not have reliable internet access, 2-1-1 has also partnered with MDHHS to help direct local residents to vaccination clinics. This builds upon the existing partnership between MDHHS and 2-1-1 for assisting residents with connecting to local testing sites. 2-1-1 is a free, confidential service that connects residents to local community-based organizations across the state offering thousands of different programs and services for people seeking answers. Seven regional 2‐1‐1 contact centers manage Michigan’s most up‐to‐date and comprehensive database of health and human services with over 7,000 agencies offering over 36,000 services across the state.
“Just as many other local, state, and federal systems have adjusted to the COVID-19 pandemic, 2-1-1 has been working collaboratively with the State of Michigan to help residents across the state with testing, emotional support, and now the vaccine rollout,” said Hassan Hammoud, executive director of 2-1-1. “We recognize that residents, especially seniors, need additional supports so that we can safely return to normalcy – and we’re proud to play a part in making a future without COVID-19 a reality for Michigan.”
Beyond scheduling appointments, MDHHS recently announced its partnership with the national education technology company GetSetUp. Through this partnership, the MDHHS Aging & Adult Services Agency is offering a series of sessions to walk older Michiganders through the Michigan COVID-19 vaccine website. The goal is to help older residents who are eligible for the vaccine find their local health department to register online for a vaccine appointment or to be added to the waitlist.
Information around this outbreak is changing rapidly. The latest information is available at Michigan.gov/Coronavirus and CDC.gov/Coronavirus. To learn more about the COVID-19 vaccine, visit Michigan.gov/COVIDVaccine.

FIGHTING FOR WORKING FAMILIES

I’m excited to share with you that this week, I was selected as Republican Leader on the Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) on the House Education and Labor Committee for the 117th Congress! Prior to serving in Congress, I spent about 40 years building and operating a small business, so I know firsthand how federal policies impact employers and employees.

Before the COVID-19 pandemic hit we had the greatest economy in the world, and I am laser-focused on ensuring we can rebuild to pre-pandemic levels by giving American workers the opportunity to secure a good-paying job, provide for their families and save for retirement, while protecting employer-sponsored benefits like health care. As Republican Leader, I look forward to working with members of the HELP subcommittee to fight against bureaucratic overreach that too often obstructs employers' ability to create jobs and hurts working families.

￼

I also look forward to continuing to serve on the K-12 subcommittee as an advocate for working families who are desperate for schools to safely reopen and access to more school choice, whether that’s through a traditional education or technical education. Through my work on both of these subcommittees, I will continue to support policies that help every American on the path toward achieving the American Dream.

While this week was originally scheduled as a district work week, House Democrat leadership on the House Education and Labor Committee called a full meeting where we marked up their costly, partisan budget scheme. Instead of spending time in our districts meeting directly with families, schools and small businesses who have been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, Democrats advanced their $1.9 trillion “relief” bill that is full of top-down mandates unrelated to the pandemic, like a $15 federal minimum wage requirement.

￼

I opposed their partisan reconciliation scheme and pointed out how the American Dream will not exist for the 1.4 million people who will lose their jobs due to a radical $15 national minimum wage hike like President Joe Biden and the Democrats are pushing.

Additionally, my Democrat colleagues on the committee blocked 5 common-sense amendments related to school reopenings, including mine that would require schools to at least offer families the option to receive in-person instruction in order to receive additional stimulus funds. I will continue fighting for working families and serve as a voice for students around the nation who are eager to return to the classroom!

￼

￼
ICYMI: This week I published in opinion piece in The Augusta Chronicle explaining that while I’m eager to work with my colleagues on reasonable legislation to restore election integrity, H.R. 1 (aka House Democrats’ #1 legislative priority) is a shameless attempt to keep one party in power through a federal takeover of our election process. You can read the full text here.

Lock and Dam Update 

￼

This week I met with local stakeholders in the CSRA to discuss the ongoing situation with the New Savannah Bluff Lock and Dam and discussed the cities’ plans to develop a solution that works for communities on both sides of the river. I’m hopeful we can come to an agreement that maintains the pool at the level required by law.

Meeting with the National Federation of the Blind of Georgia

￼

It was great to meet virtually with members to discuss their ongoing priorities, including economic opportunity, accessible medical devices, accessible websites, and civil rights for individuals who are blind.

ITC Investigation Regarding Foreign Blueberry Imports

Like so many of America’s fruits and vegetables, our domestic blueberry industry has been devastated by a surge in foreign imports – resulting in the lowest blueberry prices in years, thousands of workers across the country being laid off, and many growers shutting down business. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to end reliance on foreign imports for essentials, including our nation’s food supply.

This week, the U.S. International Trade Commission’s (USITC) released a determination in the global safeguard investigation into imports of fresh, chilled or frozen blueberries – an investigation I supported as a member of the House Agriculture Committee. I am disappointed and disagree with the ITC’s determination that imports do not seriously injure U.S. industry and hope we can find a way to urgently help our blueberry growers who are very clearly suffering from the severe consequences of the increase in foreign imports.

GA-12 COVID-19 Vaccine Locations

Starting today, more than 1,000 Walmart and Sam’s Club pharmacies in 22 states, including 11 in Georgia’s 12th district, will begin administering COVID-19 vaccines. Eligible customers can schedule a vaccine appointment directly via the Walmart and Sam’s Club (membership not required) websites once appointments are available, making it convenient to get vaccinated while allocation lasts.

Every American deserves affordable, quality health care coverage and no one should be forced to pay more due to a pre-existing condition that is out of their control.

That’s why I’m proud to cosponsor H.R. 892, the Pre-Existing Conditions Protection Act. This bill would prohibit application of pre-existing condition exclusions and guarantee availability of health insurance coverage in the individual and group market, contingent on the enactment of legislation repealing Obamacare.

February 12, 2021


It’s been rough and rocky travelin’ 

In Willie Nelson’s hit song ‘Me and Paul’ the lyrics begin “It's been rough and rocky travelin' But I'm finally standin' upright on the ground.” He was singing about all the trouble he and his dear friend the late Paul English had in traveling around the country playing shows with the likes of Kitty Wells and Charlie Pride. That song popped into my head recently as we have witnessed a rough and rocky rollout of COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Hopefully, as Willie wrote, a functioning vaccine program will soon be standin’ upright on the ground. Despite the incredible turnaround on developing and manufacturing millions of vaccines, it’s been a slow process getting it from the production line to patients’ arms. People that qualify for vaccines have signed up, only to have their much-anticipated appointment canceled due to an unanticipated vaccine shortage at the last minute. A husband and wife both in their mid-nineties recently came up to me at a Village Inn very upset that they had read where Missouri was 50th in getting the vaccine delivered to people like them. These folks were understandably desperate to get vaccinated. While I told them the study they referenced was far from accurate, I had been doing a lot to get to the bottom of the problem and would know more in a few days. You see, I was preparing to take a deep dive for answers on why the vaccine rollout wasn’t rolling. As part of this effort, I was also going to be getting an earful from Doctors and Nurses that have been on the front line battling COVID-19 daily for a year now. I carved three days out of my schedule to do nothing but sit down with these dedicated heroes right here in the 7th Congressional District of Missouri in person to hear their stories firsthand. In the end, it was a very therapeutic endeavor for both them and me.
One hospital that has more than one location in the District said that I could visit one of their sites and one of their other hospitals would join the meeting through Zoom. I quickly informed them that wouldn’t be happening. I said if I wanted to Zoom, I could do that from Washington. I explained it was important to me to meet with their people in person and look them in the eye instead of looking at a computer monitor. They relented, and I visited two of their area hospitals in person. In all, I visited six hospitals, two clinics, and one active vaccination site over the three days from Bolivar to Joplin to Branson. My first stop took me to Mercy Hospital in Springfield and if I’ve ever had a more moving meeting during my time in Congress, I don’t remember it. Mercy’s frontline Doctors and Nurses poured their hearts and in some cases their life stories out to me. At each of the stops, I held roundtable discussions with healthcare workers where they could share their stories, air their grievances, speak freely of their struggles, and let me know what they needed from folks like me in Washington. The stories came and the tears flowed. They were emotional and powerful, and I came away with nothing but total respect and a heightened appreciation for these true frontline heroes. I heard stories from doctors and nurses who have had to deal with far more loss of life than they ever dreamed they would when they signed up for medical or nursing school. They fight as hard as they can and have learned a lot about what works and what doesn’t in what is still an uphill battle to save their patients inflicted with COVID-19.
The emotional toll extracted from these frontline workers is indescribable. Many spoke to me about having Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. They talked of administering shots or treatments to patients and making hospital rounds as they are sleeping in their beds at home. Of being forced to slip away from their spouses and children at home to find a quiet spot to make calls to bereaved love ones to notify them that their beloved family member was gone as this wretched virus had claimed another victim. And still, they go to work to do it all over again the next day. There was a severe shortage of nurses in this country long before anyone had uttered the word Coronavirus. Think if you can what that shortage must look like today.  Going forward, it’s clear we’ve got to provide healthcare institutions the resources they need to address the mental health issues their frontline workers are facing. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge for everyone, and our frontline healthcare workers have heeded the call to step up for their communities and do battle with a pandemic that has been ravaging the world. They are taking care of us and our communities, and we need to make sure that we are taking care of them.
A common thread from all of my visits is that these medical facilities and their dedicated staffs are trained, ready, willing, and able to put shots in arms. They have the plans in place, and it's past time we ensure they have a consistent supply of vaccines to administer. Some hospitals told me they were promised a certain amount of vaccines for a certain day, only to end up receiving a different amount on a different day. This forces hospitals to change their schedule and leaves patients wondering when they will actually get their vaccine. Another issue is they have administered the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine which requires two doses 21 days apart or the Moderna vaccine which requires two doses 28 days apart and then are politely told “we’re switching you from Moderna to Pfizer or vice-versa.” So, what are they supposed to do to get these folks their second dose? Many of the issues we discussed could be addressed in three words predictability, communication, and supply. These hospitals need a predictable delivery of vaccines, clear communication from the state and federal governments on when which vaccine, and how much is being delivered, and the need a steady supply. Our frontline heroes are ready.
The COVID-19 relief legislation that passed in December with my total support contained billions of dollars for vaccine distribution, yet only half has been distributed to states so far. It’s time to get those funds to the states. I commend President Biden for promising to give providers three weeks’ notice for their vaccine allotments in lieu of the current three days’ notice that is inaccurate anyway. This will provide for greater predictability for states and reduce the unknowns as they distribute vaccines.
As I’ve mentioned before President Biden’s relief plan can be a good starting point for a great bipartisan package. A bipartisan relief package will ensure that the needs of everyone are addressed. It is my hope that President Biden and Congressional Democrats will begin including Republicans in their talks so that my colleagues and I can incorporate the ideas and feedback we are getting from healthcare workers in our districts and ensure our frontline healthcare workers have everything they need to win the fight against COVID-19.
For those of you not familiar with who Willie Nelson is, he was a dishwasher at ‘Aunt Martha’s Pancake House’ just east of Glenstone Ave. on Cherokee in Springfield. He would wash dishes on the weekdays and try out hoping to get a spot on the nationally televised ‘Ozark Jubilee’ on the weekends. After months of being rejected and told that he had no musical talent he finally gave up and left town. And if memory serves, I believe ‘Me and Paul’ may have been his only hit record. I’ll save my story about how local house painter Billy B. and his wife came to act in Wille’s movie Redheaded Stranger at Willie’s invitation for a later ‘Long’s Short Report.’

 Thought of the day: “Kindness is spreading sunshine into other people’s lives regardless of the weather.”
Coronavirus Update

On Thursday, Michigan reported 1,284 new cases of COVID-19 and 75 new deaths, bringing the state’s total cases to 572,179 and deaths to 15,052. Michigan’s case counts continue to trend in a hopeful direction as health care professionals work hard to vaccinate Americans. Michigan’s current positivity rate is 5.7% and has been on the decline for 20 consecutive days. Efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID are working, and we must continue to strictly follow CDC guidelines by wearing our masks (two is better than one, according to the CDC), keeping our physical distance, and washing our hands.
Michiganders must remain vigilant, with cases of the more transmissible UK COVID variant increasing in the state, including in both Washtenaw and Wayne counties. We have the tools we need to slow the spread and reduce the appearance of variants, including masking, keeping our distance, washing our hands, and getting vaccinated when eligible. Together, we will put this virus behind us and prevent more deaths, but we have to stay focused and committed.
On Monday, Michigan reported 2,043,650 COVID vaccines have been distributed and, of that, 1,446,322 vaccines have been administered. Approximately 11% of Michigan’s population has received at least one dose of the vaccine, with that number expected to increase quickly as the Biden Administration works to increase the number of vaccines distributed across the country. Michigan continues to prioritize vaccines for those 65 and older, front-line workers, some state and federal workers, jail and prison staff, Pre-K through 12th-grade teachers, and childcare providers.
Yesterday, President Biden announced that he has secured an agreement with vaccine manufacturers Moderna and Pfizer to deliver 200 million additional doses of the life-saving COVID vaccines, bringing the U.S. total to 600 million doses by the end of July—enough to vaccinate 300 million Americans. This agreement puts the U.S. on track to exceed President Biden’s original goal of administering 100 million vaccine doses in his first 100 days. After the Biden Administration inherited a disorganized and chaotic response to the ongoing pandemic, I applaud President Biden and the health experts he has empowered to lead our nation’s response with solutions based in science.
Yesterday, my House Energy and Commerce Committee held a meeting to work on President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, starting early in the morning and going late into the evening with more work to be done. We are working hard to ensure the next COVID relief package is bold and expansive to meet the needs of Americans struggling due to the ongoing pandemic and aim to have consideration of the package done before jobless programs lapse next month.
Economists agree that the next COVID relief package must be bold, expansive, and passed with urgency to meet the severity of this moment. Without the President’s American Rescue Plan, we could end up with 4 million fewer jobs this year and a slower return to pre-pandemic employment. Millions of parents, particularly mothers, may be forced to stay home, reducing their wages or forcing them to leave the workforce.

 Legislative Update
This week in Congress, I have been focused on speeding aid to struggling families and small businesses throughout Michigan. 9 House committees of jurisdiction, including my House Energy and Commerce Committee, have met this week to work on the American Rescue Plan and begin advancing key components of the package. We are dedicated to speeding assistance to Americans and confronting this pandemic with bold, science-based solutions, including rapidly expanding COVID vaccinations. It’s critical we get vaccines into the arms of as many Americans as possible, as quickly as possible, so we can crush COVID and build back a more equitable and just economy.

Dear fellow East Tennesseans,

I spent this week visiting with folks here in Tennessee and participating in my first committee markup virtually for the Education and Labor Committee. I’m excited to share updates from another busy week and important information you might find helpful below. Please consider following me on Facebook and Twitter to stay informed.

MEETING WITH HERITAGE LITES YOUTH LEADERSHIP GROUP
On Sunday, I had the pleasure of meeting with the Heritage Lites Youth Leadership group in Rogersville. The dedication and commitment these young leaders have for serving Hawkins County is proof that our community’s future is a bright one. I’m excited to see what’s ahead for each of them!
￼

DISTRICT MEETINGS RECAP
This week, I had the great pleasure of visiting with folks from Carter, Cocke, Hamblen, Hawkins, Jefferson, Johnson and Sullivan counties. Some of my highlights included meeting with city and county officials in White Pine on Tuesday, visiting Johnson County officials in Mountain City and having lunch at Suba’s Restaurant, touring TCAT Elizabethton, touring the Iconex plant in Morristown and meeting with Morristown city officials.

MY SUPPORT FOR A BIPARTISAN RURAL BROADBAND LETTER
I signed on to a bipartisan letter this week to urge President Biden to include broadband in any infrastructure plan he proposes. Connectivity has become essential for many aspects of life during the pandemic and expanding access to networks in rural communities here in East Tennessee is critical. To read the full text of the letter, click here.

LETTER TO PRESIDENT BIDEN ON REOPENING SCHOOLS
This week, I signed a letter with my GOP Doctors Caucus colleagues urging the Biden Administration to follow the science and safely get our students back in the classroom ASAP. This is desperately needed for their education and overall well-being. Check out the full letter here.

HOMELAND SECURITY COMMITTEE LETTER CALLING FOR STRONGER BORDER SECURITY
President Biden’s dangerous border security and immigration enforcement rollbacks are undermining our national security. We must secure our borders. Read the letter I signed with my Republican Homeland Security Committee colleagues here.

MY STATEMENT ON NEOPHARMA’S CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE DESIGNATION
On Thursday, I released a statement regarding the great news of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency’s decision to reaffirm that Neopharma’s critical infrastructure designation will remain in place even after the COVID-19 pandemic. Read my full statement here.

MY FIRST EDUCATION & LABOR COMMITTEE MARKUP
On Tuesday evening, I participated in a markup for the partisan budget reconciliation bill, which is being disguised as COVID relief. Instead of targeted, bipartisan pandemic relief, Democrats in the House Ed & Labor Committee chose to ram through a radical and job-destroying partisan wish list at 4 am, like mandating a $15/hour minimum wage, which will destroy small businesses and explode federal deficits. I voted against this bill in the markup.

UNITED WAY PROVIDING COVID RELIEF FOR BRISTOL RESIDENTS
Recently, United Way of Bristol TN/VA has teamed up with the cities to provide COVID-19 relief for families impacted by the pandemic. The program will use CARES Act grant funding to help residents pay electric, sewer, water and gas bills. Those who would like to inquire about assistance can contact the United Way of Bristol TN/VA office between 8:30 a.m. and 5 p.m. on weekdays at 423-968-4912 or visit their website at http://unitedwaybristol.org/.

UPCOMING SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF WEBINAR FOR TENNESSEE VENUE OWNERS
The Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development and the SBA Tennessee District Office will be hosting a webinar on February 19th to provide information on relief options for Tennessee venue owners. This includes live venue operators or promoters, theatrical producers, live performing arts organization operators, relevant museum operators, zoos and aquariums who meet specific criteria, motion picture theater operators, and talent representatives. To register for the webinar, click here.

IMPORTANT COVID RELIEF CHECK INFORMATION
If you’re eligible for a COVID stimulus relief check and have not yet received it, it may be because you need to file a 2020 tax return to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit. You have a few options on how to do this, according to the IRS:
	•	You can use one of the IRS Free File partners to electronically file a 2020 tax return and claim your credit; or
	•	In early February, you can use the IRS’ Volunteer Income Tax Return Locator tools to find somewhere local to get free tax help; or
	•	Or, you can file a paper Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR and claim the credit on line 30. The Instructions for Forms 1040 and 1040-SR provide information starting on page 57 on how to compute your credit.

TENNESSEE COVID-19 VACCINE DISTRIBUTION UPDATES
	•	The Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) recently expanded access to vaccines with a particular focus on rural and underserved areas. TDH is partnering with pharmacies and community health clinics to add more than 100 new vaccination sites across the state. The new vaccination sites for pharmacies can be found here and community health clinics here.
	•	Certain Walmart and Sam’s Club locations are now serving as COVID-19 vaccine distribution sites. For more information on locations in Tennessee, please see the list here.
	•	For detailed information on vaccine availability and other COVID-19 resources in Tennessee, check out the state’s website, covid19.tn.gov. The site is updated daily, and you can check on vaccine availability, which populations are currently being served, and register for appointments in counties that offer them.
	•	You can find county-specific vaccine information here.

GET A FASTER FEDERAL TAX REFUND WITH DIRECT DEPOSIT
I wanted to pass along a message from the IRS: the fastest way to get your tax refund is by filing electronically and choosing direct deposit. Direct deposit is free, fast, simple, safe and secure. Taxpayers can even split their refund to have it deposited into one, two or three different accounts. Check out the IRS website for more information.

KINGSPORT OFFICE INFORMATION
I want to make sure everyone has the information for my new Kingsport office. Drop by or give us a call if we can ever be of assistance. Our address is 205 Revere St., Kingsport, TN, 37660, and our phone number is (423) 398-5186.

Dear Friend,

Since I was sworn in a little over a month ago, my team and I have been working tirelessly -- as promised -- to deliver results for the people of the 4th District. Below are some highlights from the past month, as well as important updates on what we have accomplished in the past week.
￼

FIGHTING FOR FARMERS: My Amendment Securing Derecho Relief Passes House Ag Committee

This week, the House began the committee markup process on the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion stimulus bill, so the House Agriculture met for the first time to consider the ag section of this legislation. In an effort to improve the bill, I introduced several amendments that were considered during the hearing -- including one to authorize the Wildfire and Hurricane Indemnity Program Plus (WHIP+) to include those in need of assistance from last summer’s massive derecho storm, which exacerbated the challenges Iowa farmers are facing due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In a big win for Iowa farmers, I’m proud to say that my amendment passed out of the House Agriculture Committee. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this committee moving forward to deliver more results for our agriculture community.

MY LATEST COLUMN: Deficit Reduction and Control is Paramount

I wrote a column on the importance of reducing our national debt and getting our deficit under control. As a father of four, I firmly believe it is my responsibility as an elected official to leave this country better than I found it. That begins by balancing the federal budget and getting our country’s fiscal house in order by fighting against reckless, blue state-style spending.

I am committed to standing up for American taxpayers. This is your money — not the government's. I will always fight to enact fiscally responsible policies as a newly appointed member of the House Committee on the Budget.

2/12/21 15:53,Supporting Workers | An Innovation Economy,"￼

February 12, 2021
Dear Lindsey,  
As we continue our efforts to distribute the COVID-19 vaccine and bring relief to American families, we must also look ahead to our next major challenge: revitalizing our economy. That is why this week I advocated to raise the federal minimum wage, renewed my call to invest in an innovation economy, and announced the passage of my legislation that will put Americans back to work.
 
 Raise The Wage 
 
 
￼
 
 
No one should ever struggle to pay bills or put food on their table after working their full-time job. But this is the reality for far too many families in our nation. It has been over a decade since the last time we raised the federal minimum to $7.25—the longest Americans have gone without an increase since the minimum wage's creation. 
 
Raising the minimum wage is the tide that will lift all boats, put money into the pockets of the American people when they need it most, and bring desperately needed relief to families.
 
Video: My comments on the minimum wage
 
 Innovation Investments 
COVID-19 has posed an unprecedented challenge to our nation, and should be met with unprecedented action, investment, and ingenuity. That is why I renewed the push for my legislation, The Innovation Centers Acceleration Act. 
 
This bill would invest $80 billion in select cities across the country that are set up to support innovation, create jobs, and drive economic growth—and I believe Monroe County is poised for this kind of opportunity.
 
You don't have to take my word for it, either. This legislation has support from research and industry experts, including MIT Economist Simon Johnson, who agrees Rochester is a top location to develop innovation and sustain long-term economic growth. 
 
Innovation Centers Acceleration Act Press release
 
Coverage of my announcement
 
 Apprenticeship Opportunities 
 
Legislation I authored to bolster apprenticeship opportunities across America passed in the House of Representatives last week, as part of the National Apprenticeship Act. Apprenticeships are a proven investment to not only grow our economy but provide workers with financial stability and security, something our nation needs as we emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Read about my apprenticeship legislation here
 
As always, my office is here to serve you. If you ever need anything or have a question, please don't hesitate to call or reach out!
 
Warmest regards,
 
Joe Morelle
New York's 25th Congressional District

Press Release: Rep. Loudermilk: Democrats Vote Against Measure That Would Encourage Local Governments to Reopen Schools
 
 
Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga) issued the following statement after Democrats voted down his amendment in the House Financial Services Committee, which would prohibit local governments from receiving federal funding from the $1.9 trillion stimulus bill until those governments open their schools for in-person learning. 

“Democrats continue to do the exact thing they accused former President Trump and Republicans of doing, and that is not following science, and undermining public health officials. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said it herself, ‘schools can safely reopen,’ even before teachers are vaccinated. We simply cannot throw billions of dollars at this problem and pay people to be stuck at home indefinitely without addressing the root cause of the problem, which is the government prohibiting working parents from returning to work because their children’s schools remain closed to in-person learning.

That sparked arguments between USCP officers guarding the doors as members tried to enter the chamber to vote.

2/12/21 16:36,Update on direct payments and COVID-19 vaccines,"￼ 
  

Dear Neighbors,
This week, House Democrats advanced the American Rescue Plan in Congress to deliver another round of direct stimulus payments of up to $1,400 to eligible families, help rebuild our economy, and supply funding for COVID-19 vaccines. Our nation and our people are hurting. It is essential that Congress act quickly to provide the resources and support needed to bring an end to the COVID-19 pandemic. My Energy and Commerce Committee is working to move critical parts of this plan that would provide the funding we need to increase COVID-19 vaccines, increase testing and contact tracing, help struggling families pay their utility bills, and help close the digital divide in the classroom.  
This relief package invests more than $14 billion to speed up the distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines across the country. This will allow us to get more shots in people’s arms so that we can end this pandemic. The funding will also support the development of community vaccination centers, as well as mobile vaccination units that can go into hard-to-reach areas that are often underserved.  
This package also provides $46 billion for a national testing strategy, with funding for rapid tests, community-based testing sites, and expanding lab capacity. Testing, contact tracing, and mitigation are critical to reducing the spread of COVID-19, getting our kids back to school, returning to normal patterns of life, and rebuilding our economy. We also help struggling families keep their lights on, the heat working, and the water running by providing $5 billion to critical utility assistance programs. This legislation also provides $7.6 billion to expand internet connectivity to students and teachers to help bridge the digital divide for those without home internet access.  
State and local governments have been hit hard by this pandemic, facing devastating budget shortfalls that threaten vital day-to-day programs and the dedicated public servants who provide them. First responders, teachers, and public servants across our state are risking their lives to serve our communities. We cannot let state and local governments fall into bankruptcy as they provide our cities and towns with critical services. It’s estimated that the American Rescue Plan would provide New Jersey with nearly $9.5 billion - $6.5 billion to our state and $2.95 billion to our local governments - to tackle the coronavirus pandemic head-on, save lives, and support those most in need. Click here for a complete list of the estimates for cities and town in New Jersey’s 6th Congressional District.   
￼
President Biden this week announced that he would create a Community Health Centers Vaccination Program. This is great news for the equitable distribution of vaccines in the coming weeks and months. I spoke to President Biden about the need to allocate vaccine doses from the federal government directly to Community Health Centers when I met with him and other House leaders last Friday. By committing to send one million vaccines each week directly to 250 Community Health Centers, the President is ensuring these vaccines get to low-income and other vulnerable populations that have been devastated by this pandemic. I’m pleased to see that New Jersey’s health centers will begin receiving the vaccines starting next week. 
Local COVID-19 Announcements
Reminder: you can click here to learn more about how to get a COVID-19 vaccine in New Jersey if you are eligible. 
New Jersey will allow a limited number of parents and guardians to attend indoor and outdoor high school and other youth sporting events effective immediately.

2/12/21 16:59,This Is What The January Jobs Report Tells Us,"￼

Foxx Report
 
As Americans, we pride ourselves on our resilient economy, the unbridled innovation that’s found within the private sector, and a workforce that is second to none. It’s true that we hold strong standards for economic success, but with the recent jobs report from January, there are many reasons for concern. In my newsletter from June 12th of last year, I spoke with you about the great American comeback that the country was bearing witness to. Jobs came roaring back, the markets were on an upswing, and consumer confidence was rock-solid. So, what changed this past January, and where did that progress go?
Last month, only 49,000 jobs were regained. Compared to last year’s numbers – and the fact that our economy was weathering the devastating effects of COVID – this raises immediate red flags. To add insult to injury, Joe Biden’s policy priority of wiping countless energy jobs off the map not even a month into his presidency just goes to show that America is not off to a strong start. Rather than eliminating countless jobs with the stroke of a pen, he should be working to bring jobs back and respecting the livelihoods of the American people. It’s not a hard concept to grasp, but my hunch is that Joe Biden won’t make that his priority any time soon.
Simply put, the vibrant economy that’s defined this country’s success – both at home and abroad – won’t continue to hold that status if Americans are not put first. Our economy was not built through osmosis. It’s built by everyday people who show up to work and get the job done. For years, I’ve fought against radical policies that would cripple the workforce, and I won’t be stopping any time soon.
If Washington Democrats want to have a debate on how to strengthen the economy and support the workforce, I welcome it and I’ll be there with the facts and proven solutions. Putting a Band-Aid on this issue won’t solve anything. We need commonsense solutions that put people back to work so that Americans can achieve the potential they know they have. 
A Wage Hike Will Hurt The Economy
On Monday, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued a report that foretells devastating job and economic losses if the national minimum wage is bumped to $15 an hour. It may sound good on paper, but the reality is far from desirable. If the federal minimum wage balloons by 107 percent, close to 1.4 million jobs will be lost around the country – with resulting price hikes for families and consumers. This is the exact opposite of what America - and its many hardworking families – need in the middle of a pandemic. And yet, there are two Democrat-authored bills, H.R. 603, and S. 53, that will be considered both in the House of Representatives and the United States Senate. Let me be clear: Congress should be focused on creating jobs and protecting small businesses, not destroying them with misguided legislation. That must always be the priority. 
Returning Safely To The Classroom
On Tuesday, Jen Psaki, the White House Press Secretary announced that the Biden Administration’s goal as of now is to have students return to classrooms for “at least one day a week” in his first 100 days in office. But Psaki commented that the goal of having in-person classes one day a week was simply a, “…bar we are trying to leap over.” This is purely unacceptable, and it disregards the countless families who desperately seek schools to be reopened. I’ve said this countless times and I’ll say it again: the best learning environment for students is in the classroom alongside their peers. Safely reopening schools is the imperative, and with a meager approach of one day in the classroom, students are getting robbed of their educational pursuits.
Republicans on the Education and Labor Committee understand the pressure put on parents, students, and teachers, and we’re not backing down on from our mission to safely reopen schools. The longer the delays become, the more risks these young men and women take on. The clock is ticking, and we don’t have a moment to lose. I’ll continue to stand firm on this issue so that families across this great country will not continue to suffer the devastating effects of our schools being shut down.
Quote of The Week
“I believe the best social program is a job.”

Have a blessed weekend.

Legislation Introduced
	•	On Tuesday, Senators Jack Reed (D-RI), Angus King (I-ME), Rick Scott (R-FL), and I re-introduced the bipartisan Extreme Risk Protection Order and Violence Prevention Act , which would dedicate U.S. Department of Justice funds to incentivize states to adopt laws similar to Florida’s “risk protection orders.” The Florida law gives law enforcement the authority to prevent individuals who pose a threat to themselves or others from purchasing or possessing firearms, while still providing due process protections.

Read more here. 
	•	On Tuesday, Senators Bob Menendez (D-NJ), Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Dick Durbin (D-IL), Ben Cardin (D-MD), and I introduced a Senate resolution expressing the Senate’s solidarity with Cuba’s San Isidro Movement, a collective of independent artists and activists who have recently been targeted by the Cuban regime for protesting their right to freedom of expression.

February 12, 2021
Dear friend,
While most of the work out of Washington, D.C. continues to be focused on COVID-19 and relief, we also saw the start of former President Trump's impeachment trial. Re-watching the horrific violence that took place at the Capitol on January 6th affects all of us. In the context of this pandemic, it's more important than ever to take care of ourselves and others by wearing masks and practicing social distancing, but also to look after our mental health and overall well-being. To search for specific county mental health services and resources, click here.
I continue my work in the district to stay in touch with the people I represent. Below is another update on some of the work my staff and I have done this week to serve you.

Legislative work
House Committee on Energy and Commerce markup of COVID-19 relief budget reconciliation 
We know the crises brought on by COVID-19 are far from over. Americans need relief now and the government must provide resources and boost existing efforts to end the pandemic. We're closer to delivering President Biden's American Rescue Plan after this week's full committee markup of important portions of this aid package. This markup session was extended over two days, during which committee members debate, offer and vote on amendments. You can watch my remarks here to hear about the inclusion of the Tracking COVID-19 Variants Act, a bill I introduced with Rep. Ami Bera (CA-07) and Sen. Tammy Baldwin (WI). This legislation provides crucial funding to scale up national genomic sequencing efforts, which are vital to track virus mutations and further protect public health.

District work
Conversation with NDN on New Dem 100 Day Agenda
￼
This week, I discussed the New Democrat Coalition's priorities during President Biden's first 100 days in office with Simon Rosenberg, the founder of the NDN think tank and advocacy organization. As Vice Chair of the House New Democrat Coalition for Policy, I reviewed the coalition's agenda and priorities, which include ending the pandemic, getting people back to work, fighting climate change and restoring our country's leadership role in the world. If you missed this conversation, you can watch it here.
Meeting with members of the San Diego Community College District
￼
On Monday, I met with leaders from the San Diego Community College District. They spoke about the actions they would like Congress to take, including action for DACA recipients, Pell Grant increases, support for student veterans, and making Pell Grants tax exempt. We also discussed the toll COVID-19 is having on student and staff mental health
Meeting with service academy nominees
￼
On Thursday, I met the 33 students I have the honor of nominating to our nation's service academies. These young men and women were selected after applying and being interviewed by an independent service academy nomination board. The nomination makes them eligible to be selected for a fully-funded education with one academy, with the obligation and commitment to serve in the military for at least five years after graduating. Congratulations to this year's nominees! I wish you a successful and fulfilling future as you begin your careers in the armed forces.

This week's casework success story
Mehri from downtown San Diego is a nurse working at Scripps on the frontlines to battle COVID-19. She contacted the office in October to request assistance with expediting her asylum interview. Mehri originally filed in November 2016 under the previous administration's Last In/First Out policy. Since then, her interview has been delayed several times, creating uncertainty over her long-term status. My staff worked with Mehri to gather paperwork and justify the need for an expedited interview. After submitting employment letters and verification on behalf of Mehri, her expedited interview for asylum was approved.

Dear Friend,

Happy New Year! 2021 is the Year of the Ox, which represents strength, determination, and perseverance.

We saw this spirit alive and well in the American people during the COVID-19 pandemic. While we faced unprecedented challenges, we also have shown we are resilient. Through strength, determination and perseverance, I know better days are ahead.
￼

Last week I spoke on the House Floor in honor of Lunar New Year. I also am proud to introduce a bipartisan resolution to recognize Lunar New Year. I join CA-39 in celebrating this New Year and look forward to fighting for you in Congress. 

It is an honor to be able to give back to the community that has given so much to me, and I am excited to be able to work on policies that will allow Americans to achieve their American dream just like I did. I join the 39th District of California to celebrate the new year. I recognized and celebrated Lunar New Year in an address to the U.S. House of Representatives and I introduced a bipartisan resolution to commemorate the Year of the Ox. 

I wish you and yours a happy new year, and I pray that 2021 brings you success and happiness.

As always, my team and I are here to serve you. Please do not hesitate to reach out to my office with any questions or concerns. For updates on my work for you in Congress, I encourage you to sign up for my e-newsletter and follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube at @RepYoungKim.

2/12/21 17:50,Senator Rosen's Senate Briefing," ￼ 

  
Dear Fellow Nevadan, 
Welcome to this week’s edition of the Senate Briefing. The 117th Congress is getting underway. We’re officially serving on our new committees, I’m continuing to work on legislation, and I’m committed to doing everything I can to help Nevada and the country overcome the pandemic and build back better.

￼
I’m honored to join the Senate Armed Services Committee for the 117th Congress. On this committee, I will be able to better advocate for our troops, our national defense, and Nevada’s multiple military bases and installations.  I will also continue serving Nevadans on 5 other committees: Health, Education, Labor and Pensions; Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs; Commerce, Science, and Transportation; Small Business and Entrepreneurship; and Aging.  With 6 committees total, I'm proud to hold the distinction of serving on the most committees this Congress out of any Democratic Senator. 

￼
I recently introduced THREE bipartisan bills, which will support health care access in rural and underserved communities and expand our understanding of the impact of COVID-19.  The Improving Access to Health Care in Rural and Underserved Areas Act will expand access to specialty health care in communities with provider shortages through education, training, and clinical support. 
￼
The Data Mapping to Save Moms’ Lives Act will map areas in the United States that have both broadband service gaps and high rates of poor maternal health outcomes. This critical data will help identify where improved telehealth services can be most effective. 
￼
The Ensuring Understanding of COVID-19 to Protect Public Health Act will study the full health impacts of COVID-19, including its impact on a diverse array of communities from different backgrounds.
￼

IN THE NEWS

Nevada receives over $15M in grants for mental health programs
""Sen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., said she is ‘working with the governor’s office to find ways to increase access to vaccines at the federal level.’ Rosen is a member of the Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee. She signed onto a recent letter to the Trump administration urging it to actively engage with states’ vaccine distribution efforts. The coronavirus relief package passed by Congress in December included $9 billion for the CDC and the states for vaccine distribution. Of that, Nevada is to receive $47 million, Rosen said.  ‘I’m hopeful that the Biden administration will implement their distribution strategy and quickly address concerns levied by the state,’ Rosen said.” 
￼
Bills Supporting Health Care in Rural Communities Reintroduced 
""Two bipartisan bills were reintroduced to in Senate last week aimed at supporting and improving health care in rural and underserved areas.  U.S. Senator Jacky Rosen partnered with Senators Lisa Murkowski of Arkansas, Deb Fischer of Nebraska, Todd Young of Indiana and Brian Schatz of Hawaii on the bipartisan bills.   The Improving Access to Health Care in Rural and Underserved Areas Act creates a five-year program that would give funding opportunities to health clinics in rural and underserved areas to boost capacity, enhancing skills in the area and expanding access to care.   The Data Mapping to Save Moms' Lives Act would require the FCC to map areas in the country that have both broadband service gaps and high rates of poor maternal health outcomes to help identify if the areas need better access to telehealth services.”

2/12/21 17:52,Senator Murphy COVID-19 Weekly Update: February 12th,"￼
Friend – 
Below please find the Murphy office update on COVID-19. 
As always, if you need assistance, please don’t hesitate to contact our Hartford or Washington, D.C. offices. 
Here’s what you need to know this week: 
	•	Senator Murphy led 12 Senate Democrats in a letter to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell urging them to include funding for summer enrichment opportunities for low-income children in the next COVID-19 relief package. The senators stressed COVID-19’s disproportionate effects on low-income families and urged the necessity of setting aside funding for summer programs to help prevent learning loss and promote social and emotional development for particularly vulnerable communities. You can read the letter here.
	•	Today, the CDC and the U.S. Department of Education released new guidance concerning school re-opening. The CDC’s Operational Strategy for K-12 Schools adds to CDC’s existing guidance for K-12 schools in opening for in-person instruction. The document includes recommendations for COVID-19 mitigation measures, such as mask use, social distancing, cleaning and ventilation, contact tracing, testing, recommended steps depending on how COVID-19 is spreading in the community, and providing vaccines for educators and staff.
	•	Governor Ned Lamont announced that Connecticut residents between the ages of 65 to 74 now are eligible to schedule COVID-19 vaccination appointments as the state rolls into the next part of phase 1b of its vaccination program. Vaccinations for individuals over the age of 75 and those within phase 1a will continue. To find available vaccination clinics throughout the state, residents can visit ct.gov/covidvaccine and enter your zip code.
	•	This week, the Biden administration announced that they secured an additional 200 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine – which combined with previous vaccine contracts is enough to fully inoculate the entire country by the end of July.
	•	This week, the U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee’s bipartisan voted to advance the nomination of Dr. Miguel Cardona, Commissioner of Education for Connecticut and President Joe Biden’s nominee to be U.S. Secretary of Education. Click here to read Senator Murphy’s statement after he voted in favor of Dr. Cardona’s nomination.
	•	Access Health CT announced the opening of a Special Enrollment Period (SEP) for those without health insurance coverage during the public health emergency, starting Monday, February 15, until March 15. This effort aligns with the SEP for the federally run marketplace and will help consumers during the COVID-19 Pandemic. You can find out more here.

BROADBAND 
Take a Speed Test Here. 
The sad fact is that many places in West Virginia simply do not have access to reliable broadband and the lack of access affects West Virginians every day. Back in 2015, the FCC released a coverage map that stated 99.9% of Americans had wireless coverage. I knew then what I know now: That is just plain wrong. 
HOW MAY WE HELP YOU? 
To request assistance from my case team, click here.  As your U.S. Senator, I am proud to be your voice with government agencies during your time of need. My goal is for me and my staff to provide the best possible customer service for every West Virginian who contacts me needing assistance. While I have no direct jurisdiction in legal or administrative matters of any federal, state, or local agency, I welcome the opportunity to assist you in any way possible and to assure that full consideration is given to your case. See one of our success stories below: 
  
Frank Provenzano of Wellsburg applied for disability in 2019 after an industrial accident prevented him from working. He contacted Senator Manchin in October for assistance with this matter. As a result of Caseworker Angie Walsh’s inquiry, Frank was approved for disability. 
From the Hill to the Mountains
MANCHIN URGES BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO FULLY FUND BAY RESTORATION PROGRAMS  Washington, DC – Yesterday, U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV), Ben Cardin (D-MD), Tom Carper (D- DE), Bob Casey (D-PA), Mark Warner (D-VA), Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Chris Van Hollen (D-MD) wrote to President Joe Biden urging him to provide robust funding for Chesapeake Bay programs in his FY2022 budget proposal. Senator Manchin has been working in partnership with the other states in the Chesapeake Bay watershed and the federal government to improve water quality in local rivers, streams and the Chesapeake Bay by 2025.  The Senators said in part, “State and local governments in the Chesapeake Bay watershed jurisdictions, federal agencies, and academic, nongovernmental, and other partners have collaborated to restore the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem for decades. Now, as the 2025 target to have all practices and controls installed to achieve water quality standards approaches, funding programs that invest in climate solutions, sustainably manage water resources, restore habitat, and strengthen public access for outdoor recreation will advance not only the shared goals and outcomes for the restoration of the Bay, but also bolster the recovery of the regional economy.” 
Energy Committee News
MANCHIN PRAISES BIDEN ADMINISTRATION’S PLANS TO STRENGTHEN LWCF   Biden Administration rescinded Trump-Era restrictions that inhibit the availability of LWCF funding   Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, released the following statement after the Biden Administration took steps to strengthen the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) by rescinding Trump administration policies that restricted the landmark conservation program.  ""I’m glad to see the Biden Administration working to undo the previous administration’s efforts to undermine the Land and Water Conservation Fund. When Congress overwhelmingly passed my Great American Outdoors Act last year, it was an acknowledgment of our strong bipartisan commitment to better invest in the protection and preservation of our public lands so that future generations can enjoy them as we have. Following its enactment, I was disappointed that the development of an adequate project list was delayed and that former Secretary Bernhardt placed restrictions on the LWCF in violation of Congressional intent. I look forward to working with the Biden Administration to ensure that the Great American Outdoors Act is fully implemented as intended by Congress, and welcome this step towards that today,” Chairman Manchin said. 
MANCHIN PRAISES $100 MILLION DOE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ANNOUNCEMENT   Senator Manchin encourages West Virginians to apply for research funding.   Washington, DC – Today, Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, welcomed the Department of Energy’s announcement of up to $100 million in funding for transformative clean energy technology research and development via the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy’s (ARPA-E) OPEN 2021 funding opportunity. This funding will help identify cutting-edge, disruptive energy-related technologies, including clean energy technologies that will play a key role in addressing the climate crisis.  ""I’m thrilled to see the Department of Energy announce $100 million for research and development of game-changing energy technologies. Innovation is critical to addressing the climate challenges facing us today and to charting a path to a cleaner energy future. West Virginia has hosted four ARPA-E projects and the Mountain State’s innovative spirit continues to thrive. I encourage all scientists, entrepreneurs and technology trailblazers to apply for this funding. I will continue supporting the Department’s investment in these much needed technologies of the future,” Chairman Manchin said. 
MANCHIN STRESSES TO BIDEN THE NEED FOR RESPONSIBLE DOMESTIC NATURAL GAS PRODUCTION TO DELIVER ENERGY SECURITY, ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS   Manchin: Bringing back supply chains and manufacturing to the United States will rebuild and strengthen the economy   Washington, DC – Yesterday, Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, urged President Biden to consider the benefits of responsible production of natural gas as his administration evaluates the federal oil and gas leasing program and considers policies and regulations related to the energy industry. Chairman Manchin highlighted that responsible production of natural gas resources, along with the use of carbon capture, utilization and sequestration and other technologies and infrastructure to capture and transport methane, is critical to achieving energy security, economic growth and global emissions reductions.  ""I am an ardent advocate of an all-of-the-above energy policy coupled with technological innovation to solve both our country’s energy challenges and the global climate challenge. Responsible production of natural gas and practices like hydraulic fracturing have improved our nation’s energy security while supporting the nearly 1.5 million hard working Americans the industry employs, including in rural communities across our great nation,” wrote Chairman Manchin in part. “I encourage you to bear in mind the many benefits of responsible domestic natural gas production as you consider any future executive or administrative action, and I look forward to working with you to achieve our shared goals of energy security, economic growth, and global emissions reductions.”

WV STRONG
I was always taught that if you can count your blessings, you can share your blessings. I’ve been seeing so many great WV Strong and Better Angels stories. During these unprecedented times, it’s important to focus on all the wonderful things that are still happening every day in our beautiful state. 
Nominated as today’s Better Angels are two Appalachian Power employees who rescued a man from a burning car in Clendenin. Brandon Johnson, a line mechanic and volunteer firefighter, and his colleague John Hughes were on the job when they saw a vehicle on fire with the passenger unable to escape, and they sprang into action.

WORKING FOR YOU
MANCHIN: WEST VIRGINIA RECEIVING ANOTHER INCREASE IN WEEKLY COVID-19 VACCINE ALLOCATION  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) received notification that West Virginia will be receiving another increase in the weekly vaccine allocation.  ""Today I was notified that West Virginia will receive another weekly increase of 1,400 vaccine doses in addition to the 7,300 doses we will receive through the Federal Pharmacy Program. This is the third consecutive dosage increase for West Virginia and I am very pleased that the Biden Administration is following through on the promise to quickly increase vaccine production. As West Virginia continues to lead the nation in effective and safe COVID-19 vaccination distribution, it is vital that we continue to receive additional doses so every West Virginian who wants to be vaccinated can be. This is great news for the Mountain State and I will continue to work with the Biden Administration to quickly procure more doses as production increases,"" said Senator Manchin.

2/12/21 18:29,Governor Inslee Has Failed Central Washington,"

  
 

Governor Inslee Has Failed Central Washington 

Yesterday, Governor Inslee, announced that all but one region in Washington state - the South Central region - have moved to Phase 2 of reopening. 

Since the beginning of this pandemic, Governor Inslee has failed to lead our state based on clear facts and unambiguous scientific guidelines. He has shown no effort to understand the unique challenges of Central Washington, and his ever-changing metrics have unfairly targeted our region, despite the progress we have made.  

In response to his baseless orders and restrictions being called out by members of his own party, he backtracked and moved their regions into Phase 2, leaving our rural region - which is already disproportionately disadvantaged - behind.  

There is simply no scientific reason businesses following the safety guidance in opened areas are any more safe than Central Washington’s businesses following the same guidelines. These are real people’s lives and livelihoods at stake, and keeping us shuttered away - despite evidence of successful reopening in regions like ours across the country - is causing more long-term damage than he seems to care to realize. 
﻿
Enough is enough. It is time our state legislators, local health boards, and health officials take the lead on implementing safety measures and monitoring for adjustments as needed. Governor Inslee has failed the people of Central Washington and lost all credibility. 

Fighting for Our Dams
 

This week, Rep. Mike Simpson (R-ID) proposed a plan to breach the lower Snake River dams.

I have said it time and time again: As long as I am in Congress, nobody is tearing down our dams. I have great respect for Representative Simpson, and we will continue to work together on many different policy issues that impact the Pacific Northwest — but removing or breaching the Lower Snake River Dams is one that we fundamentally disagree on.

Dams and salmon can – and do – coexist. The extensive, world-class research and technological advances occurring at the Lower Snake River Dams is already leading the way for significantly improved fish passage rates. We have seen tremendous progress, and I will continue to support efforts to improve salmon survivability.

I am steadfast in my commitment to support our dams and the countless benefits they provide to Central Washington, including a vibrant native salmon population.

“Having to deal with yet another effort to breach the Snake River dams is exasperating, but at least the proposal out of Idaho recognizes the dams’ value to the region and the real cost to dismantle them.” More from the Tri-City Herald: “$33 billion Idaho plan to breach Snake River dams got one thing right” 


Standing Up for 11,000 American Jobs in a Pandemic 
 

President Biden’s recent Executive Order to terminate the Keystone XL Pipeline is a devastating blow to our nation’s energy independence and economy. 

I joined Reps. Dusty Johnson and Kelly Armstrong in South Dakota to hear from folks on the ground about the real impacts this reckless executive action has on workers, local businesses, and rural communities. It is our job to amplify their voices, and we will continue to do just that.

A Tribute to Our American Legacy
 

While in South Dakota, I had the opportunity to visit Mount Rushmore, a tribute to some of our country’s great heroes and a physical reminder that our national story is one of courage, honor, and progress. Monuments like Mount Rushmore serve as a celebration of our nation’s history and a symbol of hope for the future. America’s ideals and values are worth fighting for in order to build a more perfect Union. 

Getting Kids Back to School
 

This week I joined my Republican colleagues in sending a letter to President Biden urging him to reopen American schools to in-person instruction so that students will not be deprived of critical services and support structures. 

President Biden pledged to reopen schools to in-person instruction within the first one hundred days of his presidency. Now, his Administration is backtracking on his promise and dismissing guidance from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Administrator Rochelle Walenksy and the American Medical Association who have both stated that schools can reopen without increasing the spread of COVID-19. 

The President cannot continue to be held hostage by special interest groups while mental health crises and educational inequality devastate our children. Rural students in particular, like many in Central Washington lack access to broadband, technology, and the support systems that make at-home learning possible. It's time to get our kids back in school. 

The full text of the letter can be found here. 

Supporting Local Breweries and Wineries
 

On Thursday, I joined my colleagues to introduce the Fairness for Craft Beverage Producers Act, a bill that would allow craft breweries, wineries, distilleries, and other small beverage producers that depend on in-person sales in their taprooms and tasting rooms to be eligible for a larger maximum loan amount in the Second Draw Paycheck Protection Program (PPP).

Most of us have visited our local craft brewery or winery, and in so many ways, they bring our communities together. In Central Washington, the craft beverage industry is a huge economic driver, and like small businesses across the country, they have been devastated by the pandemic. With taprooms and tasting rooms closed around the state and decreased sales across the board, there is a real risk of watching Washington’s wine and beer industries disappear before our eyes.

As a Member of the Congressional Small Brewers Caucus and co-chair of the Congressional Wine Caucus, I recognize the significant impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on craft beverage producers, and prolonged state-imposed shutdowns have exacerbated economic losses.

This bill aims to provide them the relief they need to stay afloat and eventually return to the flourishing, high-quality breweries and wineries we are so proud of.

It is an honor and a privilege to represent you in Congress.

Dan Newhouse

Dear Lindsey,

This week in Washington was a “committee work week” – a week when members are not voting on the House floor but are instead meeting in their respective committees to attend hearings and markups. I flew to D.C. to attend markups for both the Education and Labor Committee and the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Our Education and Labor Committee bill markup lasted 13 hours! Just hours after we wrapped up that first committee markup of the year, I was back in the office with the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee. It was a very busy few days, and I am looking forward to spending some time back in the district this upcoming week. 

I am also writing to you at the start of the Lunar New Year – and want to wish you all a healthy, safe, and prosperous year. This year has been challenging for many, but with the new year comes a new beginning and the hope of better days ahead. Happy New Year! 

I’ll be using this newsletter as a way to keep you up to date on my work on behalf of our Orange County community, so make sure you sign up for regular updates. You can also connect with my official Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages, where I’ll be posting the latest news and updates. 

Serving California's 48th District

Securing aid for OC Cities
Did you know that the majority of Orange County's cities did not meet the population threshold to receive direct aid via the CARES Act’s Coronavirus Relief Fund? This week I joined a bipartisan letter to House leadership requesting these cities, which face equal pandemic challenges, are not left behind. Read the letter here.  

Mental Health Resources in Orange County

Safely Reopening our Schools 
This week I’ve continued my work to open our schools and get our students back in the classroom.
﻿
I joined over 60 of my colleagues in a letter to President Biden urging him to follow the science and safely reopen schools across the country. In December, then President-Elect Biden pledged to open the nation’s schools during his first 100 days in office. However, last month the Administration said that the goal only applied to schools teaching students up to eighth grade, and just this week they adjusted their pledge, stating that schools will be considered “open” if they are providing in-person instruction once a week. Read the letter here. 
﻿
During our Education & Labor Committee Markup of the proposed budget for the next fiscal year, which included President Biden’s $1.9 trillion COVID relief legislation, I spoke in support of private and public schools as they work to educate students safely. I also offered an amendment that would have required schools to reopen as soon as vaccines are made available to teachers. This would not have required teachers to be vaccinated, rather it would have classrooms reopen once teachers had the opportunity to protect themselves from the virus. 


Supporting the Mental Health of our Transportation Workers 
During our Transportation and Infrastructure markup, I offered an amendment that would have provided funds to organizations that support the mental health of our transportation workers, who are face-to-face with millions of Americans nationwide every single day. My colleague from California, Rep. Grace Napolitano, offered to work together in support of mental health support and funding. This is a bipartisan issue that we can all get behind. 
￼

Cutting Taxes 
This week I cosponsored bipartisan legislation to fully restore the State and Local Tax (SALT) Deduction. The SALT deduction cap of $10,000 has resulted in a tax increase for many middle-class families. In California and other high cost of living areas, the SALT cap has been harmful. That’s why I am proud to cosponsor this legislation to help get more money back in your pocket. Read more.

Here's what local House members are doing, so far, in the legislative fight against COVID-19

Freshman GOP Rep. Michelle Steel of Seal Beach has been focused on getting students back in classrooms. Last week, she spoke on the House floor to support the Reopen Schools Act, which would make sure that the $54 billion in federal coronavirus aid set aside for education in the COVID-19 relief bill would go only to schools that have re-opened for in-person instruction.

IA-01 Update From Congresswoman Hinson

Friend, 

Thank you for signing up for my e-newsletter, where you can stay up to date on all of my work for Iowa's First District in Congress! 

While it has been an unprecedented start to this year in Washington, I've been putting my head down and getting straight to work for Iowa's First District. I am excited to be serving Iowans on both the House Appropriations Committee and the House Budget Committee where I will fight for priorities that matter to Iowans and rural America, ensure taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly, push back on Democrats’ liberal agenda, and bring some desperately needed transparency to government spending. 

So far, I have introduced two bills, the Reopen Schools Act, which will help students get back in the classroom safely, and the Vaccinate Americans, Not Terrorists Act, which will prevent the federal government from sending vaccines to Guantanamo Bay while American citizens still have outstanding requests for the vaccine. 

Additionally, I've co-sponsored 48 pieces of legislation--including bills to protect the unborn, better use taxpayer resources, and ensure our veterans get the care they deserve.

This week, I was back home in Iowa traveling through the district and hearing directly from constituents, organizations, and businesses about how I can best serve them in Washington. From meeting with law enforcement in Jones County to touring the shop floor at Kinze Manufacturing in Williamsburg, and discussing COVID-19 vaccine distribution at Crescent Community Health Center in Dubuque--I left every meeting with a to-do list or legislative idea I will bring back to Washington. 

I also wanted to provide an update on the COVID-19 vaccine in Iowa. I've heard from many of you who are concerned about receiving the COVID-19 vaccine and Iowa lagging behind -- I'm worried about this, too. My team and I have been in constant communication with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Biden Administration, and Governor Reynolds's office to ensure Iowans have access to more doses of the vaccine and are not left behind. This week, I led the entire Iowa House Delegation in urging the Biden Administration to partner with Iowa's federally qualified community health centers to administer the vaccine to more Iowans as soon as possible. I will keep you updated on these efforts and will continue working around the clock to address issues Iowans are facing in receiving the COVID-19 vaccine. 

Below, I've included some additional updates from my time as your representative as well as a survey about the legislative priorities you'd like me to work on in Congress on your behalf. Thank you for sending me to Washington, it is an honor to represent you and your families in Congress! 

Best,

Greetings,
As we cross the one-year mark in fighting the global Coronavirus pandemic, we can see a light at the end of the tunnel. Thanks to the great work of Operation Warp Speed, we have multiple safe and effective vaccines available to the public. I encourage everyone to take the vaccine once it becomes available to you.  While this is a very personal decision to make, I encourage each of us to receive the vaccine so that we can protect our families and our communities, and we can soon return to normal life as soon as possible. For the last year, we have all faced different challenges and adapted our lifestyles as we awaited a solution.
The vaccine will not solve all our problems, of course, but it will put America back on the right track. I hope you will all consider taking the vaccine for the sake of those who are hurting. I know Arkansas is strong and resilient - we will get through this together.
Until next week,
￼

This week has been particularly cold in Arkansas, and temperatures are continuing to drop. I was shocked when I read a low of 1 degree Fahrenheit for Monday in Hot Springs! 
While winter weather can leave beautiful snow dustings across the state, please stay safe and warm this weekend. Keep off the roads if you can, bring your pets inside, and bundle up if you leave your home.

Dear West Virginian,  This week, we made real progress on tackling some of the issues critical to our state.  At a White House meeting with the president and a few of my Senate colleagues, I urged everyone to work together to rebuild and modernize our nation’s infrastructure, and promote economic development in communities across West Virginia and the country.  I was also officially elected to be the top Republican on the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee. I look forward to continuing working together with Chairman Tom Carper (D-Del.), as well as our other colleagues on the committee to develop commonsense solutions that positively impact the lives of Americans from all parts of the country, especially West Virginia.  Keep scrolling for more details on these updates and more.  Tackling Our Nation’s Transportation Infrastructure Needs  With my new position as the top Republican on EPW, I was invited to the White House along with a few of my Senate colleagues to meet with President Biden, Vice President Harris, and Transportation Secretary Buttigieg, to discuss the nation’s transportation and infrastructure needs. We had a positive and substantive meeting with all involved, and discussed the need to rebuild our nation’s infrastructure, something all Americans want.  We should be forward leaning when it comes to tackling the transportation needs of today and tomorrow in a way that works for all communities, instead of a one-sized-fits all approach. We agreed during the meeting that the process should and can continue this way as we work together to craft meaningful legislation.  I am committed to working toward our common goal of addressing the transportation needs of all communities, specifically those in West Virginia. This includes working towards additional highway capacity, bridge improvements, innovative transportation technologies, and expanding broadband infrastructure. I made certain that President Biden recognized the infrastructural challenges we face in West Virginia. Read more about the meeting here.  To keep up with my work on the EPW Committee, be sure to follow @EPWGOP on Twitter and @epwgop on Instagram for the latest news and updates.  Nominee Update  This week, the Senate EPW Committee voted on North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality Secretary Michael Regan to be the administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). During our recent conversations, Secretary Regan could not commit to oppose Obama-era regulations that would economically devastate West Virginia. Due to that, I could not support him.  Let me be clear: my decision is not a personal one. Mr. Regan is a professional and affable gentleman. However, I remain deeply concerned about unaccountable climate czars in the White House and their control over EPA and environmental policy. My upmost priority remains to protect West Virginia from the regulatory overreach and policies that have devastated our state in the past.

2/12/21 18:50,Weekly Wrap-Up: Getting Americans Safely Back to Work,"￼

Dear Lindsey,  I hope you and your family are staying safe amid this winter weather.
 
This week, the U.S. House Agriculture Committee reelected me to serve as Chair of the Conservation and Forestry Subcommittee in the new Congress. I’m honored to again serve as Chair of this Subcommittee, and I’m looking forward to bringing our district's farmers and producers to the table to share their perspectives on responsible stewardship and sustainable economic growth across the rural economy.
  
￼
￼
  
I also introduced a bipartisan bill to reduce the financial burden to small businesses and local restaurants as they look to safely reopen during this pandemic.
 
Continue reading for a brief recap of my week. As always, thank you for the honor of serving Virginia's Seventh District.
  
 
WHAT I'M WORKING ON
 
  
This week, I introduced bipartisan legislation to make sure small businesses, schools, and first responders can afford necessary safety supplies and equipment, including PPE, rapid testing kits, and other supplies. While costs are high, employers recognize the importance of protecting employee safety and community health, and my bipartisan Getting Americans Safely Back to Work Act would immediately allow local businesses to address some of the financial issues they're facing as they look to fully reopen. Combined with a strengthened COVID-19 vaccine strategy, these safety measures are commonsense moves to protect our neighbors and communities. READ MORE FROM CBS NEWS

Another 2,005 doses of COVID-19 vaccine were administered this week. All together, on Rota 353 shots have been given, on Tinian 141, and on Saipan 12,477.
 

Federal funds to save furloughed workers

Furloughed Commonwealth employees could get their jobs back, if the Democratic proposal to provide the Marianas $515,000,000 to make up for lost government revenue gets to the President for signature. The proposal is part of the Biden administration’s American Rescue Plan, which is now going through the committee approval process in the House of Representatives. The Committee on Oversight and Government Operations, was marking up its piece of the Rescue plan, containing the Marianas money in a Coronavirus State Fiscal Recovery Fund, as we went to press. The former President and Senate Republicans blocked this direct aid for state and territory governments in the December relief package, P.L. 116-260. Speaker Nancy Pelosi plans to have the House send the completed American Rescue Plan bill to the Senate by the end of the month. The goal is to have the President sign it into law before the current round of unemployment assistance expires on March 14. 
 

PUA extended, more taxpayer relief

Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (with a $345 weekly maximum) and Federal  Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (raised to $400 weekly) are extended through August 29 in the section of the American Rescue Plan approved by the House Ways and Means Committee on Thursday. The Committee also agreed with President Biden’s commitment for a total direct payment to taxpayers of $2,000 by adding $1,400 to the $600 in the December relief package. At the same time, the Committee increased the Child Tax Credit from $2,000 to $3,600 for each child under six years of age and to $3,000 for each child up to age eighteen. The federal government already covers 100 percent of the cost of the Child Tax Credit in the Marianas, but the Committee agreed to add 100 percent reimbursement for the Earned Income Tax Credit for working families in the Marianas to the Democrats American Rescue Plan, as well, consistent with legislation I first introduced in 2015. The House passed my 100 percent EITC reimbursement, but the Trump administration blocked it in the Senate with a veto threat. 
 
 

The day began brightly, but the sky was dark and the stars were out before the Education and Labor Committee finished its work on the American Rescue Plan at 4:30 a.m. on Tuesday morning. PSS can look forward to another $160 million, when the bill we approved makes it through Congress.

More money to pay teachers

The Education and Labor, where I am a member, held an all-night mark-up of our section of the American Rescue Plan on Monday/Tuesday. We set-aside funds for insular area K-12 schools, of which the Marianas will receive about $160 million. Last year, we provided $23 million for the Marianas Public School System in the CARES Act and another $62 million in December’s P.L. 116-260. All of these relief funds are in addition to the regular annual federal funding to the Public School System and have allowed PSS to keep paying teachers and staff, when the Commonwealth stopped much of its funding for education. The Committee also approved $40 billion for higher education nationwide, which will provide a direct payment to Northern Marianas College, and $10 million for native language, like the PSS Chamorro and Refaluwasch programs.  
 
 

NAP gets a shot in the arm

At the Agriculture Committee mark-up on Tuesday, we confirmed the $30 million for the Marianas Nutrition Assistance Program, which I negotiated with leadership last week. This $30 million, together with annual block grant funding of $12.148 million in our FY22 and FY23 appropriation measures—or $54.296 million—should be sufficient to sustain NAP well into FY23. FY21 funding already exceeds the $31 million, which Governor Torres reported to me in August was needed, as a result of the extra $14 million I included in P.L. 116-269 and residual funding I put into the Agricultural Act of 2014, when I previously served on the Agriculture Committee, and from the CARES Act and my $25 amendment of the disaster relief bill, P.L. 116-260, in 2019. 
 
 

Re-elected to Education Chair

Democratic members of the Education and Labor Committee elected me to serve another term as Chair of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education on Monday. My focus as Chair will be safely reopening schools nationwide, so students, teachers, and staff can remain healthy. We must also make sure educators have the resources they need to address whatever learning loss occurred because of school closures. Also organizing this week was the House Agriculture Committee, where I selected a seat on the Subcommittee on Nutrition, Oversight, and Department Operations. The Subcommittee has jurisdiction over the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, so membership will allow me to keep working on including the Marianas in SNAP. On the House Veterans Affairs Committee I chose the Health and Oversight Subcommittees to continue my work to improve health care for Marianas veterans. The Natural Resources Committee, my fourth committee, organizes on February 18 it was announced today.
 

$13.2m Yutu recovery grant for NMC

It has been 14 months since the Cooperative Research, Extension, and Education Services Center at Northern Marianas College applied for the typhoon recovery funding Congress provided in Public Law 116-20. So, I am very grateful to the Biden administration for taking long-overdue action and awarding $13.2 million to help CREES “build back better.” After being nearly destroyed in typhoons Soudelor and Yutu, the Center’s application called for construction of a typhoon-resistant building. The new, three-story building, with an area of 12,800 square feet will house laboratories and instructional space for the College’s nursing program, as well as a multi-function room, administrative offices, and utility and storage areas, all of which will enable CREES to build economic resilience and stimulate sustainable economic growth in the Marianas. The Economic Development Administration, which administers the funds, says they are expected to help create 272 jobs and generate $13.5 million in private investment. Congratulations to CRESS and NMC!
 
 

Virtual meetings keep everyone safe from COVID-19. Above, the House Veterans Affairs Committee met on Thursday for its first full committee meeting in the 117th Congress.

President’s OIA budget falls short 

President Trump’s fiscal year 2021 spending request for the Office of Insular Affairs, released Monday, cuts the agency’s discretionary budget from $103 million to $82 million. I convened the House Committee on Natural Resources for our annual OIA budget oversight hearing the next day; and OIA officials, though invited, declined to defend the President’s cuts in person.

FY17 budget highlights

President Obama sent his Fiscal Year 2017 budget proposal to Congress last Tuesday. A long-sought goal of insular areas— getting the same funding as U.S. states for Medicaid coverage of low income persons—is part of the President’s budget proposal.

This week, Senator Scott spoke on the Senate floor and introduced a resolution to honor the 17 innocent lives lost on February 14, 2018 during the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. We will never forget them. 
Senator Scott also continued his work on behalf of Florida families by introducing his Set Testing and Objectives Plan (STOP) COVID-19 Act which sets distribution reporting and transparency standards to keep Americans informed and healthy and his World Health Organization (WHO) Accountability Act to hold the WHO accountable and withhold American taxpayer dollars from the organization until significant reforms are made.

Sen. Rick Scott: Biden Must Stand Up for Human Rights; Reject Rejoining UN Human Rights Council 
Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after the Biden Administration announced it will reengage with the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council.  Senator Rick Scott said, “Time and time again, the UN Human Rights Council has contradicted its own mission and refused to promote and protect human rights around the world. They have proven to be nothing more than a UN sanctioned club that spends most of its time targeting our ally, Israel. The council has also refused to hold the Cuban regime accountable, given Nicolas Maduro, a murderous dictator who is committing genocide against his people, a seat at the table and ignored Communist China’s campaign of genocide against the Uyghurs. As I’ve said before, their actions don’t match their rhetoric, and re-engaging with them in any capacity would be a tragic mistake. The Biden Administration must make it absolutely clear that the United States stands for human rights and reject engaging with an organization that turns a blind eye to genocide.” Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott: Biden debe defender los derechos humanos; Rechazar la reincorporación al Consejo de Derechos Humanos de la ONU 
El Senador Rick Scott hizo la siguiente declaración luego de la decisión de la Administración Biden de reincorporarse al Consejo de Derechos Humanos de las Naciones Unidas (ONU).  El Senador Rick Scott dijo: “Una y otra vez, el Consejo de Derechos Humanos de la ONU se ha contradicho ante su misión y se ha negado a promover y proteger los derechos humanos alrededor del mundo. Han demostrado que no son nada más que un club autorizado por la ONU para perseguir y promover una campaña en contra de nuestro aliado, Israel. El Consejo también se ha negado a responsabilizar al régimen cubano, le ha dado a Nicolás Maduro, un dictador asesino que está cometiendo genocidio contra su pueblo, un lugar en la mesa y ha ignorado la campaña de genocidio de la China comunista contra los uigures. Como he dicho antes, sus acciones no siguen su retórica y reincorporarse al Consejo en cualquier capacidad sería un error trágico. La Administración Biden debe dejar absolutamente claro que los Estados Unidos defienden los derechos humanos y rechazar regresar a una organización que ignora el genocidio”. Lea más AQUÍ.

 Sen. Rick Scott: $15 Minimum Wage Will Kill 1.4 Million Jobs and Devastate U.S. Economy 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement after the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released a report on the disastrous economic impacts of the Biden Administration’s proposal to increase the federal minimum wage to $15.    Senator Rick Scott said, “I spent my life in business, and I know what it’s like to have to make payroll and make the tough choices to succeed. President Biden continues to push his job-killing agenda, including a $15 minimum wage, despite all evidence showing that it will devastate our economy and small businesses. Just last week, Senate Democrats overwhelmingly joined Republicans in voting against raising the national minimum wage to $15 during the pandemic. We know that enacting a $15 minimum wage now would be catastrophic for small businesses and the jobs they provide families and now we have data showing its impacts would stretch far beyond our battle against COVID-19. A new report from the CBO confirms that raising the minimum wage to $15 will increase the national debt by $70 billion and eliminate 1.4 million jobs. That is unacceptable. Instead of making every attempt to kill the American Dream and destroy small businesses, Democrats should work on creating a strong economy so every family has the opportunity to succeed."" Read more HERE.

Sens. Rick Scott and Josh Hawley Introduce WHO Accountability Act to Address Inaction and Lies About the Coronavirus Pandemic 
Senators Rick Scott and Josh Hawley introduced the World Health Organization (WHO) Accountability Act to hold the WHO responsible for its role in helping Communist China cover up information regarding the threat of the coronavirus. The WHO Accountability Act withholds U.S. taxpayer dollars from the WHO until the organization replaces its leadership, as of January 1, 2020, and accepts Taiwan as a member state. It also limits U.S. funding to the same or less than the top contributor nation to the WHO each year.   Senator Rick Scott said, “The mission of the WHO is to get public health information to the world so every country can make the best decisions to keep their citizens safe. The WHO not only failed its mission, but it failed the world when it comes to the coronavirus. They served as a puppet for the Chinese Communist Party – parroting misinformation and helping Communist China cover up a global pandemic. Last February, I called on the WHO to do its own in-depth analysis on the extent and origins of the coronavirus. It took them nearly a year to take action and we still have no answer. They have even dropped their investigation into whether COVID-19 leaked from Wuhan lab. Their inaction has grave consequences.   “The WHO also needs to answer for its refusal to include Taiwan in its membership, meetings, and information, especially in the face of the coronavirus. They are complicit in Communist China’s effort to isolate Taiwan. There is no reason U.S. taxpayers should be spending hundreds of millions a year, more than any other country, to fund the WHO without significant reform. I’m proud to introduce the WHO Accountability Act to withhold American taxpayer dollars from the WHO until they start actually caring about public health, stop acting like a puppet for the Communist China and allow Taiwan as a member.” Read more HERE.

Senator Rick Scott Joins Senator Marco Rubio and Colleagues in Resolution in Support of Interim President Guaidó and Condemning Venezuela’s Fraudulent Legislative Elections 
Senator Rick Scott joined Senator Marco Rubio and colleagues to introduce a resolution condemning last year’s fraudulent legislative elections by the Maduro regime. The resolution also denounces the lack of free, fair, and transparent elections in Venezuela, as well as the continued erosion of the nation’s democracy and the rule of law.  
Senator Rick Scott said, “I am proud to join my colleagues today to send a clear message to Nicolas Maduro: the United States will never stop fighting for the people of Venezuela. The appearance of democracy is not democracy and the world knows that Venezuela’s election, coordinated by the Maduro regime, is nothing more than a sham. Maduro is a ruthless dictator that murders and oppresses his own people. The United States and freedom-loving countries around the world must continue their unwavering support of interim President Juan Guaidó and denounce Maduro’s murderous regime. As Florida’s U.S. Senator, I’ve made fighting for freedom in Latin America and across the globe a top priority and I will not stop until the people of Venezuela see a new day of democracy."" Read more from Senator Rubio’s office HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott Reintroduces STOP COVID-19 Act  
Senator Rick Scott reintroduced the Set Testing and Objectives Plan (STOP) COVID-19 Act to set vaccine distribution reporting and transparency standards for states and create a program for cities and counties to increase testing, contact tracing and transparency efforts in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19.  Senator Rick Scott said, “We’ve made incredible progress on developing the vaccine and getting doses to states, but there is still a lot more work to do when it comes to ending the virus. All levels of government must work together to quickly distribute the vaccine so every American who wants one can easily get one. We also need to implement transparent, efficient and measurable ways to contain the spread. The STOP COVID-19 Act sets vaccine distribution reporting and transparency standards for states and creates a program for cities and counties, using metrics-based incentives, to ensure communities are doing everything possible to keep residents safe. We must keep working to end the coronavirus and give Americans as much information as possible, so we can get back to our new normal."" Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott: Democrats Ignore the Facts in Continued Push for Wasteful Blue State Bailouts 
Senator Rick Scott released a statement ahead of the House Oversight and Reform Committee’s meeting on Friday, February 12, during which members will consider allocating $350 billion in taxpayer funding to bail out wasteful, liberal states like New York, California and Illinois for their decades of financial mismanagement. The meeting comes as the State of Illinois announced that it was able to pay down more than $700 million in debt and reduce its overall budget shortfall by $2.5 billion thanks to a stronger economic performance than expected in 2020.   Senator Rick Scott said, “The Democrats just don’t know when to stop. First, California announced its 2020 revenues were so good that the state was putting more than $22 billion away in reserves. Now, Illinois is seeing similar good fortunes and has reduced its overall budget shortfall by $2.5 billion. But liberals in Washington can’t be bothered by the facts. House and Senate Democrats insist on moving forward with their radical plan to award wasteful bailouts for failed politicians in states like New York and California. Congress has already allocated more than $4.5 trillion to address this crisis, including roughly $400 billion for state and local governments. As more and more data makes clear, this bailout is nothing more than a liberal payback to governors who helped elect them. Democrats need to return to reality, remember their obligation to the American taxpayer, and stop using American tax dollars to backfill their friends’ mismanaged pensions and state budgets.” Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott: Biden’s Reversal on Communist China Crackdown is Short-Sighted and Dangerous 
Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after a number of measures by the Biden Administration signal a much weaker approach when it comes to Communist China, including:
	•	Rolling back the plan for the sale of TikTok’s American operations;
	•	Tossing a proposed rule that would have required U.S. universities and K-12 schools with foreign exchange programs to disclose any financial ties or other connections to Chinese state-run Confucius Institutes;
	•	Suspending an order blocking Chinese components in the U.S. power grid; and
	•	Refusing to firmly commit to keep Huawei on the Department of Commerce’s “no-entity” list – an essential move for national security. 
Senator Rick Scott said, “It is no secret that Communist China’s plan is world domination. The easier we go on Communist China, the quicker General Secretary Xi will swoop in and take advantage. President Biden’s moves to roll back actions taken under President Trump to hold Communist China accountable are reckless and show just how far he will go to appease the authoritarian regime. Failing to stand up to General Secretary Xi has absolutely devastating consequences for our national security and for that of our allies. We don’t need nice phone calls or another task force to study what’s going on with Communist China. We need to employ a proactive, aggressive and strategic approach to combat the Chinese threat – and that includes banning TikTok, cutting ties with Confucius Institutes at universities and schools, keeping Communist China out of our power grid, ending threats against our peaceful ally, Taiwan, keeping Huawei on the blacklist, and setting strong policy that shows the world where we stand."" Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott to Colleagues: Inflation from Unsustainable Federal Debt Hurts American Families 
Senator Rick Scott wrote a letter to his colleagues in Congress urging them, once again, to join him in addressing the nation’s massive and unsustainable debt. For too long, Congress has spent with reckless disregard for the consequences of a growing national debt and its effects on inflation, which directly impacts American families and businesses. Senator Scott’s letter comes as the CBO reported that the federal debt would reach 107 percent of GDP in 2031, the highest level in U.S. history. Read more, including the full letter, HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott: Biden’s Failure to Call Israeli PM Netanyahu is Unacceptable 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following disturbing reports that President Biden has yet to call Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.   Senator Rick Scott said, “President Biden’s failure to call Prime Minister Netanyahu is unacceptable and sends a deeply troubling message on the priorities of the United States under his Administration. It is unconscionable that Biden would restore aid to the Palestinians, who openly support terrorism, wage war against Israel and do not recognize its existence, before having a discussion with Israel’s prime minister. President Biden must apologize for this grave mistake and immediately make clear his commitment to uphold the longstanding and special partnership between the United States and Israel.   “Israel is our partner in every sense of the word and one of America’s most valued allies. In the Middle East, Israel shines as a beacon of democracy and for decades the United States has proudly supported and defended our great ally against our adversaries. As both Governor and Florida’s U.S. Senator, I have travelled to Israel several times and met with Prime Minister Netanyahu and Israeli leaders. Israel is an important partner in trade and we have no greater ally than Israel in our efforts to ensure peace in the Middle East, and around the world. It is unbelievable that President Biden would call Communist China’s General Secretary Xi, a dictator and adversary, before connecting with our ally, Israel. The call should happen today."" Read more HERE.

February 12, 2021
Dear friend,
 
As the work of the 117th Congress ramps up, now is our opportunity to address COVID-19 head-on and lay the groundwork for our nation to build back better from this pandemic — help cannot come soon enough. This week, President Biden followed through on his promise and announced that his administration has purchased an additional 200 million COVID-19 vaccine doses, meaning that the United States has now secured enough vaccines to immunize all Americans. While this is incredibly encouraging news, it will be some time before all of the vaccines are produced, distributed, and are administered into arms. We must continue taking precautions to prevent the spread and save lives including washing our hands frequently, avoiding crowds, and wearing masks while we are in public. Tragically, the national death toll for COVID-19 climbed to 475,000 this week. My thoughts are with the families and loved ones of those who have lost their lives to this virus, including more than 1,100 Granite Staters.
 
There is a light at the end of the tunnel, and I am confident that we will get through this together, but Americans in the Granite State and across the country need direct relief now — the economic crisis is accelerating with millions out of work, food and housing insecurity climbing, and our most vulnerable communities bearing the brunt of the dual health and economic crises. The time for decisive action is now. Last week, the House and Senate both passed budget resolutions to pave the way for President Biden’s landmark American Rescue Plan.
  
￼
President Biden's American Rescue Plan will boost COVID vaccine distribution and help struggling families
  
And this week, we got to work in Congress advancing this much-needed plan.
  
 
Addressing COVID-19 Head-On
 
  
 
￼
 
Speaking in favor of the Agriculture Committee budget proposal
  
On Wednesday, we held a seven-hour markup in the House Agriculture Committee to advance the reconciliation package for the next year. Our Granite State farmers and producers are the backbone of New Hampshire’s $850 million agriculture economy and serve as a key part of our state’s economic engine. But, because of the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis, they are suffering and need support. As we work towards a new COVID-19 relief package, it is critical that we provide support for our farmers and producers. I’m thrilled the House Agriculture Committee passed a proactive, forward-looking reconciliation package to get us to the other side of this pandemic, and I will continue working with my colleagues on the Agriculture Committee, Secretary-Designate Vilsack, and the Biden-Harris administration to ensure relief gets delivered quickly and fairly, and that our farmers, producers, and consumers have the resources and support they need to succeed.
  
￼
Advocating for bolstered pandemic response during Energy and Commerce Committee markup
  
Hardworking Americans in the Granite State and across the country need direct relief NOW. And, after a two-day, 17-hour long Energy and Commerce Committee markup that wrapped up this afternoon, we are one step closer to ensuring more help is on the way for those who need it. There is no greater public health priority than crushing this pandemic, and the legislation we passed in the Energy and Commerce Committee today reflects that urgency. This package focuses on bolstering the efficient and equitable distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines, ensuring our frontline workers and health professionals have the resources they need to keep their communities safe, and providing support for struggling families and individuals. There’s a lot of work to be done to put COVID-19 behind us, and I’m committed to building back better so no one is left behind as we recover from this pandemic.
  
￼
I’m proud to stand up for families in need during the COVID crisis
  
There are nearly 11 million children living in poverty in the United States, and the COVID-19 pandemic is pushing already struggling families closer to the edge. This is unacceptable.
 
We must ensure our families and kids have the resources they need to thrive. This week, in step with the Biden administration’s bold American Rescue Plan, I joined a plan to support families in need. By making the Child Tax Credit refundable, all parents earning less than $75,000 a year and couples earning less than $150,000 will receive $3,600 a year per child for children under the age of 6 and $3,000 for children under the age of 18. This is going to make it easier for parents to put food on the table and a roof over their family’s head.   
  
 
Bringing Granite State Voices to Congress
 
  
 
￼
 
I heard from the NH Food Alliance, UNH Extension, Warner Public Market, the Hanover Co-op, and Kearsarge Gore Farm leadership
  
On Monday, I met with New Hampshire food distributors and producers to discuss challenges and opportunities in developing a sustainable, resilient local food system, and how Congress can support their work during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. This pandemic has created many challenges for our food system and highlighted those that already existed — including racial and economic inequality. We must do a better job of ensuring that all have access to healthy food. I’ve been so impressed by the ingenuity of our Granite State farmers and producers throughout this crisis, and, through my role on the House Agriculture Committee, I will continue to bring their voices to Congress and to help foster creative solutions so that we can continue to grow a vibrant and healthy local food system.
  
 
￼
 
I joined Rep. Pappas and NH transportation stakeholders to discuss the Capitol Corridor Project
  
On Thursday, I joined Rep. Chris Pappas and leaders in the New Hampshire transportation field to talk about bringing commuter rail to New Hampshire and the status of the Capitol Corridor Project. Our Transportation network is more than roads, bridges, and rail tracks — it is a vital economic engine that drives growth and creates jobs in all of our communities. But, here in New Hampshire and throughout much of New England, we have fallen woefully behind in maintaining and improving our transportation infrastructure to meet our current and future needs. Passenger rail will make our state more economically competitive, prevent commuters from spending endless hours sitting in traffic, and plug New Hampshire’s burgeoning tech industry in with the vast pools of talent in Boston, helping bring the best and brightest minds in the region to employers in Nashua, Manchester and beyond. I will continue working to advance legislative efforts in Congress to support the expansion of commuter rail in New Hampshire.
  
￼
Rep. Gonzalez and I sent a letter to the Biden administration, urging them to combat child exploitation
  
In recent years, there has been a sharp increase in reported child sexual abuse material (CSAM). The concerning rise in reports comes at a time when spreading CSAM online is easier than ever and people are spending more time online due to COVID-19. We must take action to prevent the spread of CSAM. This week, I was proud to join my colleague Rep. Anthony Gonzalez in urging the Biden-Harris administration to make combating the spread of CSAM a priority and ensure additional funding for law enforcement officers who are tasked with preventing the spread of this material online.
  
￼
This week, the Biden-Harris administration reinstated key environmental protections
  
We cannot go backward in our work to protect New Hampshire’s iconic natural treasures and great outdoor experiences. This week, I was pleased that the Biden-Harris administration repealed harmful Trump-era policies threatening conservation efforts in NH. Last year, we passed the Great American Outdoors Act through Congress to ensure states like New Hampshire can count on consistent funding and support as they plan conservation projects that are important to our state and region. I was proud to join both our NH delegation, as well as dozens of House colleagues from both sides of the aisle, in calling on the Interior Department to rollback short-sighted and damaging actions that were taken in the lame-duck period of the Trump administration. I applaud the Biden administration for moving so quickly today to make this right.
  
 
Hope on the Homefront
 
  
￼
I joined Rep. Pappas to announce an estimated $1.5 billion for NH in the next COVID package
  
On Wednesday, I was proud to announce, alongside Rep. Pappas, that New Hampshire is estimated to receive $1.5 billion for state, local, and county governments in the proposed American Rescue Plan relief package. The COVID-19 pandemic requires a bold, robust response to see our state and nation through to the other side of this crisis. New Hampshire counties, cities, and towns have stepped up over the past year to keep Granite Staters safe, and it’s critical that we provide them with the resources to continue serving their communities. This funding is not a fix-all solution, but it is a tremendous step forward toward ensuring no one is left behind as we continue to address this public health crisis. In Congress, I will continue working to get this legislation over the finish line as quickly as possible to ensure that our hardworking Granite State families, businesses, and first responders have the support they need to thrive and make it through this pandemic.
  
￼
I joined Senators Shaheen and Hassan to announce funding for Groton, NH
  
Earlier this week, I was proud to join Senators Shaheen and Hassan to announce that Groton, NH is slated to receive $250,000 in Department of Agriculture grant funding for a new Public Works Department building after its current one sustained wide-scale flood damage. This funding will allow the Public Works Department in Groton to move out of its current flood-damaged building into a new, upgraded space that will provide employees with a comfortable place to work, protect town equipment, and ensure Groton residents continue receiving the essential services the Public Works Department provides. I’ll continue working to ensure Granite State communities have the tools they need to thrive and succeed.
  
￼
I joined Dartmouth’s podcast, The Ballot, to talk about where our nation is heading
  
We have a difficult road ahead of us in our efforts to crush COVID-19, re-open our economy, and pave a better path forward for our country. Still, I am filled with hope and optimism about where our nation is heading, and what we can achieve by working together. I joined Dartmouth’s podcast, The Ballot, to talk about the state of our nation and where we go next.
 
Granite Staters have been stepping up for their neighbors and communities since this crisis began, and I’ve been so impressed with their resilience and progress. Congratulations to Chief Justice Landya B. McCafferty on receiving the Philip Hollman Award for her work advancing gender equality in New Hampshire’s legal system. Landya is a leader, educator, and role model for young people everywhere and I look forward to seeing what she does next!
  
 
News You Can Use
 
  
￼
Wearing two masks has proven more effective than one in preventing the spread of COVID-19. Click here for information from the CDC on how to ensure you are getting maximum protection from your mask.
  
This week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the results of a lab experiment that found that wearing two masks can be much more effective than one in slowing the spread of the coronavirus. The researchers found that wearing one mask — surgical or cloth — blocked around 40% of the particles coming toward the head that was breathing in. When a cloth mask was worn on top of a surgical mask, about 80% were blocked.
 
For nearly a year, our state and nation have been dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic, and so have our children. While the virus itself has largely spared children's physical health, studies have shown it has taken a toll on their mental health. While we work to expand access to mental health services and re-open our schools to get students back into classrooms, there are preventive measures parents and guardians can take, both immediate and longer-term, for kids who are seemingly faring well, or those in crisis.
 
Sign-ups for Phase 1B of New Hampshire’s COVID-19 vaccination process are now open. Phase 1B opens vaccine registration to:
	•	Those 65 years or older
	•	Those under 65 but medically vulnerable
	•	Residents or staff of residential facilities
	•	Correctional officers working in facilities 
Confirm your eligibility and register for your vaccination on www.vaccines.nh.gov/. If you need assistance, you can call 2-1-1 for help. Starting today, at appointments scheduled through the state, eligible Granite Staters can get COVID-19 vaccinations at Walgreens. State health officials said vaccine shipments to New Hampshire have increased, and they hope to pick up the pace of vaccinations.
 
As always, the CDC and the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services are the best resources to turn to during the COVID-19 public health emergency. If you are sick, stay home and call your health care provider. If you live in NH and have questions about coronavirus, dial 2-1-1 or visit CDC.gov for more information.   To stay updated on my work in Congress and around the Granite State, as well as for important information and resources, like my page on Facebook and follow me on Twitter.    As we all continue working to keep ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities safe, remember that hope and brighter days are on the way! We’re all in this together, and we will come out stronger on the other side. I hope you have a fun and safe weekend!   Sincerely,    Annie

Speaking Up for President Biden's 
American Rescue Plan 
￼

As the Energy & Commerce Committee met to mark up portions of President Biden's American Rescue Plan, I spoke about the importance of stepping up and passing this much-needed relief package. We promised the American people that we would go big, crush the pandemic, and save lives and livelihoods. It is now time to come together and get this done!

Raising Concerns Over the EU's Tariffs on Florida's Grapefruit Industry

￼

I led bipartisan members of the Florida congressional delegation in a letter to Acting U.S. Trade Representative, Maria Pagan, expressing concerns over retaliatory tariffs placed by the European Union (EU) on U.S. agricultural products, particularly Florida grapefruits.  

With the addition of a twenty-five percent retaliatory tariff on top of the existing 1.5 percent tariff, grapefruit exports from Florida have shrunk significantly. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Florida growers have already been struggling to maintain their livelihoods. If immediate action is not taken and the United States loses the fresh grapefruit market in the EU, they could face even harsher consequences.

Working with the Biden Administration to Boost Vaccine Allotments in Florida 
￼
￼
￼
￼
We are working to continue increasing Florida's vaccine allotment. It is our goal to get more Central Floridians vaccinated against COVID-19. 

Currently, we are in phase 1, which means the vaccine is available for long term care facility residents and staff, persons 65 years of age and older, and healthcare personnel with direct patient contact. 

In March, Florida will begin distributing the vaccine to critical organizations (as identified by the governor) and vulnerable populations who are at risk of severe illness. 

During phase 3 in April, our hope is that the vaccine will be available to the general public. 

As we continue receiving updates, we will communicate with our constituents to make sure everyone has the opportunity to be vaccinated against COVID-19. 

I have been vaccinated and urge you to do so once you are eligible! 

COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution in the District

As COVID-19 infections rise in Central Florida, we are working with local officials to provide up-to-date information on vaccinations. For more information on your county's distribution plans, please visit the websites linked below.

2/13/21 6:00,Pushing for a national COVID rescue plan,"￼

 
Our COVID Lifeline is Moving Through Congress
 
February 13, 2021
 Dear Friends,
While the eyes of the nation were on the powerful impeachment trial unfolding in the Senate this week, my colleagues and I were hard at work moving the pieces into place for a bold new COVID rescue for the American People. 
On Thursday, I kept up the pressure in the Energy and Commerce Committee to push for key COVID provisions during this major budget debate.
The legislative package we’re fighting for delivers a decisive and compassionate response that speaks to the critical needs of our workers, families and communities, both during this crisis and as we lay the foundation for America’s economic and personal recovery.
This rescue package would inject some $440 million in direct federal COVID-19 relief into our counties, cities, towns, and villages across New York’s 20th Congressional District to help maintain essential services and staff including teachers, nurses, firefighters, water systems managers and countless others. Under the current plan: 
	•	Public services in Albany County will receive a total of $173,960,989 
	•	Public services in Montgomery County will receive a total of $16,931,078*        
	•	Public services in Rensselaer County will receive a total of $82,699,814*
	•	Public services in Saratoga County will receive a total of $49,867,173*    
	•	Public services in Schenectady County will receive a total of $117,073,466
*NOTE: totals reflect funding for county & municipal governments within the boundary lines of NY-20
The COVID relief package also includes:
	•	Vaccines: $7.5 billion for vaccine distribution and support at the CDC to ensure workers on the ground have the resources they need along with $5.2 billion for research, development, manufacturing, production, and purchase of COVID-19 vaccines and ancillary supplies.
	•	Testing: $46 billion for testing, contact tracing, and mitigation. This includes implementing a national strategy for testing, contact tracing, surveillance, and mitigation and providing technical assistance, guidance, support and grants to states.
	•	Mental Health: $4 billion to scale up behavioral, mental health and addiction services and treatments.
	•	Utility Assistance: $5 billion in consumer energy and water assistance for Americans who are struggling to pay their bills, make ends meet, keep the lights on, the heat working and the water running.
	•	Broadband Access: $7.6 billion for schools and libraries to purchase technology and equipment that students, teachers & faculty need to conduct remote learning and help deliver broadband access for the millions of low-income households. 
	•	Health Disparities: $25.2 billion to address health disparities and protect vulnerable populations by ensuring increased access to COVID-19 testing in medically underserved areas, and equitable distribution of vaccines and supplies.
One major section of this COVID relief package is my bipartisan Medicaid Reentry Act, vital legislation that gives states flexibility to use Medicaid to ensure people leaving jail or prison have access to basic healthcare including mental health, addiction treatment and COVID testing. 
Every moment of delay in a COVID response means another life lost, another business shuttered, another family that slips into poverty. 
This week, we paved the way for landmark legislation that meets the size and scope of this crisis. We need to move this rescue package forward now and show the American people know that help is indeed on the way.  
As always, thank you for reading.   Your friend, ￼ 
 
 
p.s. As we celebrate Black History Month this month, consider the countless Black scientists, doctors and health care workers who have brought pioneering achievements in medicine and the many others who are fighting to beat this pandemic for all of us. For example, Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett is a viral immunologist at the National Institutes of Health and one of the leading scientists who worked to develop the Moderna COVID vaccine!
We must do all we can to ensure Dr. Corbett’s pioneering work, and the work of countless other scientists and doctors is not wasted. We must stay focused on equitable vaccine distribution, and work to achieve widespread immunity to save and protect our families and communities.
 
DID YOU KNOW?
Throughout this pandemic, my office and I have worked to make sure you remain informed with the latest updates and recommendations on any and all COVID-19 related topics. With that in mind here is some information from the IRS that may be of interest to you:
	•	Tax filing season opened on February 12, and there are simple steps you can take to help ensure you file accurate tax returns and speed tax refunds to avoid a variety of pandemic-related issues.
	•	People who have previously not used e-file, the IRS emphasizes using it this year to avoid paper-related processing delays.
	◦	Taxpayers can file electronically by using a tax professional, IRS Free File or other commercial tax preparation software.
	•	Taxpayers have until Thursday, April 15, 2021, to file their 2020 tax return and pay any tax owed. 
	•	This IRS fact sheet explains what taxpayers need to know to file a complete and accurate tax return.
	•	For the first time, Forms 1040 and 1040-SR are available in Spanish, and the IRS has a new form allowing taxpayers to request that they receive information from the IRS in their preferred language.

Iowans must have confidence we are receiving our fair share of vaccines. While the CDC routinely releases the state-by-state vaccine data for allocation, doses delivered and administration, it is difficult to determine based on this data whether Iowa is receiving its fair share.
This is why Senator Ernst and I are calling on the CDC to publish the week-to-week formula. Transparency will ensure Iowans and all Americans can confirm the federal government is fairly allocating vaccines and build confidence in the vaccine distribution process. 
In the middle of a pandemic, the federal government must also do everything it can to protect the inmates in its care. In 2018, the First Step Act established important home confinement and early release programs, which are especially important right now. 
The COVID-19 Safer Detention Act would clarify and expand those programs we wrote into the First Step Act, so we can better protect older and vulnerable populations.

2/13/21 8:37,American Presidents,"￼ 

February 13, 2021 
Dear Fellow Marylander: 
For many, Presidents’ Day usually is not a holiday that inspires deep philosophical reflections. 
But this year is different. 
On Monday, as we commemorate the lives of our most remarkable presidents like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, the U.S. Senate will be at the end of an unprecedented second trial for a U.S. president who was impeached while in office. 
So, as we execute our duties as set forth in the Constitution and act as jurors considering the impeachability of a former president, Presidents’ Day 2021 begs us to consider what qualities define the best of America’s chief executives. 
Humility is a quality that springs to mind first, probably because it’s quite difficult to strike a balance between being arguably the most powerful person in the world and the inherent fallibility of all human beings. 
Nobody’s perfect, and yet no one likes admitting they were wrong about anything. Ever. 
Truly great presidents, however, have been as willing to embrace their failures as they are their finest hours. Failures teach us lessons that victories never could. From failure can be born monumental success. 
President Lincoln’s life is a prime example. The internet is jam-packed with hardships that Lincoln supposedly suffered before becoming perhaps one of our finest presidents. While only maybe half of them actually are true, they are remarkable nonetheless. 
Lincoln endured and overcame political and personal heartbreak, mountains of honorably assumed debt, and a string of professional disappointments. 
Yet his terms as president redefined the type of massive social change possible via the Executive Branch, and the sheer good that resulted from his courage cannot be overstated. 
""Always bear in mind that your own resolution to succeed is more important than any other one thing,” President Lincoln wrote in 1855. 
Another great leader who led the nation out of extreme challenges, Franklin D. Roosevelt, underscored this mindset. “It is common sense to take a method and try it. If it fails, admit it frankly, and try another,” he said. “But by all means, try something."" 
The sage words of FDR also reveal another key attribute of the finest presidents, unshakable determination. 
His cousin, President Theodore Roosevelt, put a finer point on it. 
""No, I’m not a good shot,” the famed hunter and conservationist once said. “But I shoot often."" 
The 26th president, a populist’s populist, also had a clear understanding of the true meaning of patriotism, another facet shared by our finest leaders. 
""Patriotism means to stand by the country,” Roosevelt wrote. “It does not mean to stand by the president."" 
Teddy Roosevelt’s incisiveness rings especially poignant at the crossroads we find ourselves in today. As my colleagues consider how they will vote at the end of the current trial, I most hope they reflect on this Republican president’s reflections on patriotism. 
Interestingly, Roosevelt penned these words in a 1918 essay entitled “Lincoln and Free Speech,” which speaks to another key trait of our best presidents: a strong commitment to our First Amendment freedoms. 
Because his presidency occurred against the backdrop of the Civil War, President Lincoln was one of the first chief executives to find himself in a situation where free speech and assembly were limited to protect the lives of our military and hold the country together. 
Still, Lincoln, a strong believer in human liberties, knew there was a clear line between Americans’ First Amendment rights to peaceful assembly and a violent insurrection. In 1838, Lincoln said, “There is no grievance that is a fit object of redress by mob law."" 
Indeed, Mr. Lincoln. 
Another great, President John F. Kennedy, spoke frequently of the importance of being devoted to protecting these liberties so critical to our democracy. 
""I think it is appropriate that we pay tribute to this great constitutional principle which is enshrined in the First Amendment of the Constitution: the principle of religious independence, of religious liberty, of religious freedom."" 
""I would not look with favor upon a President working to subvert the First Amendment’s guarantees of religious liberty,” Kennedy said in 1960. “Neither do I look with favor upon those who would work to subvert Article VI of the Constitution by requiring a religious test - even by indirection."" 
President Kennedy’s support of our First Amendment protections also extended to respecting the role of the “Fourth Estate,” our free press, as all great presidents do.   
In April 1961, President Kennedy addressed the American Newspaper Publishers Association as Cold War tensions were spiking.   
“The unprecedented nature of this challenge … also gives rise to your second obligation — an obligation which I share. And that is our obligation to inform and alert the American people — to make certain that they possess all the facts that they need, and understand them as well — the perils, the prospects, the purposes of our program and the choices that we face."" 
""No President should fear public scrutiny of his program,” President Kennedy said. “For from that scrutiny comes understanding; and from that understanding comes support or opposition. And both are necessary."" 
""I am not asking your newspapers to support the administration, but I am asking your help in the tremendous task of informing and alerting the American people,” said President Kennedy. 
""For I have complete confidence in the response and dedication of our citizens whenever they are fully informed."" 
Complete confidence in the American people is another shared quality of all great presidents. Our distinct, shared perseverance is one of the many qualities that make America great. 
""When times get tough, we don’t give up,” President Barack Obama said of America. “We get up."" 
That resolve is being tested. As a nation, and as a Senate, we are being forced to decide whether to act in support of justice and accountability for a president who trashed the norms of the office and incited a violent insurrection against the very foundations of our government. 
On Presidents’ Day 2021, the words of the man the holiday was created to honor, President George Washington, ring most true. Washington’s unwavering commitment to justice set the standard for future presidents. 
Said President Washington: “No punishment, in my opinion, is too great for the man who can build his greatness upon his country’s ruin."" 
Thank you for your time. Please stay safe.

Additional Coronavirus Relief
After continued promises of unity, House Democrats are continuing to work at a rapid pace to advance their massive stimulus bill, putting more emphasis on getting it done quickly than actually crafting responsible policy that will help the country. In committee markup after committee markup, they have rejected sensible amendments offered by Republicans as they race to pass their partisan bill that does more to advance their agenda than solve problems that the country faces. 
They have refused to unfreeze the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP), failing to support producers impacted by the pandemic. They have failed American workers by prolonging dependence on government programs and they have fallen short in meeting the broadband connectivity demands of rural communities. Congress has worked together to provide assistance in support of both the transportation and agricultural sectors, and Republicans will continue to consider the need for careful, targeted measures. In weighing additional measures, we must be good stewards of taxpayers’ money. Republicans are not opposed to providing more help where necessary, but this rushed, one-sided procedure is the wrong approach and contradicts President Biden’s pledge for unity and bipartisanship.
Congratulations to the city of Ash Flat in winning the ""Best Tasting Water"" in the Arkansas Rural Water Association Taste Test in September of 2020 which advanced them to the finals of the National Rural Water Association's ""Great American Water Taste Test"" where they placed 3rd for the BEST TASTING WATER IN AMERICA!

Congressman Smith's E-news: February 13, 2021  
￼

￼

This week I spoke at the 2021 Bean Day, hosted by the Nebraska Dry Bean Growers Association, to discuss trade, CFAP, and hear producer priorities for this year.

Encouraging the American Workforce

Getting Americans back to work has been one of the primary challenges facing our nation since the COVID-19 pandemic began nearly one year ago. While the employment situation varies widely from state to state, ensuring every unemployed American can reconnect with work must be a top priority. In Nebraska we are fortunate to have an unemployment rate of just 3%, making us one of 18 states that have an unemployment rate below 5%. Other states which have had more restrictive lockdowns are seeing much higher rates of unemployment. 
 
The bipartisan COVID relief packages I supported last year were strongly focused on keeping workers connected during such difficult times. The Paycheck Protection Program was a loan program guaranteed by the Small Business Administration to help eligible small businesses and non-profits keep employees on the payroll. PPP loans have proved to be vital to the small businesses whose doors would have otherwise closed as a result of the loss of business brought on by the pandemic. Unfortunately, the current spending package pushed by President Biden and Congressional Democrats does not contain measures to encourage the most critical part of the American workforce: connecting workers and employers.
 
In addition to programs like PPP, the CARES Act also included a program to provide an additional $600 per week for every Unemployment Insurance recipient through the spring and summer of last year. While the goal of this program was well intended – to help the short term unemployed until temporarily closed businesses could reopen – I soon heard from employers across Nebraska that it was a major impediment to hiring or rehiring workers. The recently proposed $400 per week will be just as problematic as the prior $600 for Nebraska businesses looking for employees. 
 
I support COVID relief, but the bill the Democrats are pushing through simply does not help main street businesses reconnect the unemployed with jobs. Because of my concern, I introduced an amendment which would have allowed states to choose how they deploy the additional unemployment funds provided in the bill based on their own unique situations by allowing states with low unemployment to pay a lower unemployment add-on and using the remaining funds to pay back-to-work bonuses or provide reemployment services. Despite my amendment being an opportunity for states to better serve their unemployed, Democrats rejected my amendment. 
 
Congress should be laser-focused on defeating COVID and reopening our economy. We must recognize the reality of our economy and provide actual aid to the American workforce. The Democrats are pushing forward a partisan package full of their own wish list rather than targeted relief for the unemployed. The coronavirus pandemic is unlike anything we have seen before, and as we approach almost a full year of the trials and tribulations brought on by it, we cannot allow non COVID-specific bills, like the one before us, to masquerade as a resource for workers and businesses. We must do better to return to a working America.  

In the News
I joined KRVN Radio to discuss the urgent need to release the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program funds that were frozen from the USDA. Listen to my interview here. 

Keystone Pipeline
This week I joined 20 of my colleagues in sending a letter to President Biden urging him to reconsider his decision to discontinue the Keystone XL project, as well as his decision to cease the issuance of new licenses for oil and gas drilling. These projects contribute to the economic growth of local communities and provide well-paying jobs to Americans, both of which are particularly important as the nation grapples with the coronavirus pandemic.

West Virginia Families Are Forgotten in Biden Climate Agenda
This week, I delivered opening remarks during a hearing focused on the federal response to climate change. During my remarks I explained to the committee how detrimental it would be for hard-working Americans if the Biden Administration transitioned from using fossil fuels as a main energy resource:
“When the war on coal was underway, there was no transition to renewables, but rather those workers adapted their skills for jobs in the natural gas sector. What about America’s steel industry. During the 80s and 90s, excessive government regulations devastated steel towns and families. Think about it. Just 45 years ago, America was producing give times the amount of steel as China...The companies and jobs are gone. The communities have never recovered. Where was the compassionate transition for those communities and families?"" 
￼
Listen to My Opening Remarks
 

Restore Postal Service in Rural Communities
This week, Marcy Kaptur (D-OH) and I introduced bipartisan legislation that will return overnight delivery for first class mail, newspapers, and other post to the millions of Americans that use this service.
Starting in 2012, the U.S. Postal Service implemented an organization-wide changes that would close mail processing facilities and end the overnight delivery for mail sent and received in the same area. In lowering “service standards,” USPS abandoned the small and rural communities who rely heavily on the postal services to deliver their essential needs.
“Millions of rural Americans rely on postal services to receive critical packages they need, whether that be medications, bills, or even letters from grandma,” said Rep. McKinley. “During the pandemic, many have had to use the postal service to stay connected with their families, friends, and loved ones. In these unprecedented times, USPS should be held accountable to ensure that all Americans receive their mail in a timely manner, no matter where they live.”
Joining Reps. McKinley and Kaptur as original cosponsors are Reps. Joyce (R-OH), Tonko (D-NY), Young (R-AK), Ryan (D-OH), Fitzpatrick (R-PA), and Allred (D-TX).
Last Congress the resolution garnered 206 bipartisan cosponsors.

Expanding Access to Specialty Care in Rural Areas
On Monday, Peter Welch (D-Vt.) and I reintroduced bipartisan legislation that will incentivize specialty physicians to practice in small communities by forgiving their student loans in return for a commitment to practice in rural areas for 6 years.
“Expanding access to critical health professionals in rural communities remains essential to supporting the health and well-being of Americans nationwide,” said Rep. McKinley. “In many parts of the country there is a shortage of doctors in specialty areas, which reduces the access to care. Patients are forced to drive long distances simply to get the care they need – or worse, they forgo needed treatment. This bill will help improve quality of life for people in small communities across the country.”

 COVID-19 Vaccine
To date, 122,017 people in West Virginia are fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

The free vaccination clinics will be held in Berkeley, Braxton, Cabell, Greenbrier, Hancock, Hardy, Harrison, Kanawha, Logan, Marshall, Mercer, Monongalia, Pocahontas, Raleigh, Randolph, and Wood counties.

2/13/21 10:06,Weekly Update: U.S. Attorneys Should Be Allowed To Conclude Their Important Work,"

Weekly Update | February 13, 2021
 

U.S. Attorneys Should Be Allowed To Conclude Their Important Work

While U.S. Attorneys ultimately serve at the pleasure of the President, I believe it would be reckless and irresponsible for President Biden to fire U.S. Attorneys John Lausch, of the Northern District of Illinois, and John Milhiser, of the Central District of Illinois, without successors nominated and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. U.S. Attorney Lausch is currently pursuing a historic and major public corruption investigation involving a years-long bribery scheme that has implicated former House Speaker Michael Madigan and others. U.S. Attorney Milhiser recently announced an indictment against former State Senator Sam McCann for criminal charges, including fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion.
 
There is precedent for allowing a U.S. Attorney to remain in office until successors are confirmed, and I strongly believe both should be allowed to do so. I urge President Biden to permit U.S. Attorneys Lausch and Milhiser to remain in their jobs to conclude their ongoing corruption investigations and criminal cases.

Talking With K-12 School Administrators on Re-Opening
 

Pictured above: I talked with K-12 school administrators during a virtual listening session on Wednesday, February 10th 

On Wednesday, I hosted a Virtual COVID-19 Listening Session with K-12 School Administrators with two dozen school districts from across the 13th Congressional District participating. The discussion focused on the status of each district's transition back to in-person learning and what needs to happen to accomplish that transition. There were three common issues raised by local school administrators: funding, vaccines, and public health guidance. 

The vast majority of schools across my district are providing full-time or at least partial in-person learning and I am grateful for the administrators, teachers, and students for making that happen. I represent both rural and urban school districts and recognize they face different sets of challenges, but it is important we all work together to get schools reopened. 

I voted for additional federal funding for schools and vaccine distribution in December and that funding is on the way. Our kids deserve the best learning environment we can give them. That is undeniably in-person instruction and the science shows we can make that happen sooner rather than later.

Talking With County Health Departments on COVID-19 Vaccine Administration
 

Pictured above: I listened to county health department administrators during a virtual listening session on Monday, February 8th

On Monday, I hosted a Virtual COVID-19 Listening Session with County Health Departments with most all department administrators across the 13th Congressional District participating. The discussion focused on vaccine administration, testing operations, and contact tracing. Bolstering vaccine supply, funding to get shots in arms, and earlier notification of dosage allotments to improve planning were the main areas local leaders indicated they need support from the state and federal government. 

Our local county health departments are doing an admirable job of getting vaccines administered while still continuing testing and contact tracing operations. I heard clear and consistently that departments need more vaccines, further advance communication of allotments for planning purposes, and additional funding to get shots into arms. 

In December I voted for legislation that included billions of dollars for purchasing vaccines and distributing them. I will continue to listen to our public health officials leading the fight against the pandemic to see how we can best support their efforts. The sooner we get people vaccinated the sooner we can get back to normal. 

I continue to urge the Governor to take steps necessary to get shots into arms. With hard-working, capable county health department staff like the folks I spoke to yesterday there is no reason our state should be ranked at the tail-end of most vaccination measures.

Editorial: ""Biden Sacks a Corruption Prober""

President Joe Biden and his Department of Justice announced their intent to terminate dozens of U.S. Attorneys across the country, including John Lausch of the Northern District of Illinois. Editorial boards and lawmakers from both parties urged President Biden to allow Lausch to stay on the job until he concludes his work and a successor is confirmed.

From the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board: Biden Sacks a Corruption Prober: 

“A new President abruptly fires a prosecutor overseeing high-level political corruption cases. That’s big news, right? Well, it was in 2017 when President Trump axed Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York at the time and a media favorite. You can tell power in Washington has changed hands because of the muted response as the Biden White House ousts U.S. Attorney John Lausch of the Northern District of Illinois.
 
“Joe Biden is swiftly pushing out almost all U.S. attorneys who served under his predecessor, which is increasingly the norm for new Presidents. But even Illinois Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, staunch allies of Mr. Biden, objected to his firing of Mr. Lausch, who has been a scourge of corruption in Democratic-dominated Springfield.
 
“…Mr. Lausch’s corruption probes have implicated a Chicago alderman and Springfield politicians. In July 2020 his office announced a $200 million settlement with the state’s primary electric utility company for its efforts to buy off “associates of a high-level elected official for the state of Illinois.”
 
“That official is reported to be Michael Madigan, who until last month had been Speaker of the Illinois House for all but two years since 1983. The investigation is continuing, and there’s no reason outside of politics that Mr. Lausch shouldn’t be kept on the job until the Senate confirms a successor. Mr. Lausch’s four-year term ends in November 2021, and getting a replacement could take that long…”

From the Chicago Tribune Editorial Board: President Biden: Keep our U.S. Attorney John Lausch: 

“President Joe Biden’s Justice Department dismissed U.S. attorneys across the country appointed by former President Donald Trump on Tuesday, and Northern District of Illinois U.S. Attorney John Lausch appears to be out. That would be a terrible decision by Biden.
 
“…And what a coincidence that the politicians indicted, charged or under investigation so far happen to be mostly Democrats. Dismissing Lausch will look like a Biden-Durbin-Duckworth favor to their corrupt Democrat pals.
 
“…Lausch also has been helping Mayor Lori Lightfoot in Chicago with violent crime. The effort known as Operation Legend, which fanned across several U.S. cities to battle increases in crime, was credited as of last fall with 262 charges of firearm offenses in the Northern District, a number 33% higher than 2018 and 48% higher than 2017, according to the Trump Justice Department.”

HAPPENING IN THE HOUSE This week, the Energy and Commerce Committee marked up the next COVID relief package.  During my opening statement, I emphasized the importance of access to mental health care and how it must be included in the conversation for a relief bill. The pandemic has made the mental health crisis in our country worse and not all communities are lucky enough to have an organization like Light of Hope to provide these services. 
￼

 I also offered an amendment which would increase funding for mental health services for those who have been negatively impacted by President Biden's cancellation of the Keystone XL Pipeline and the Administration's pause on oil and gas drilling on public lands. This attack on the American oil and gas industry is nothing short of betrayal, and those who have lost good-paying energy jobs need our support. Unfortunately, House Democrats did not agree, and they promptly dismissed my attempt to provide relief to American workers in the interest of their partisan agenda.

I voted against the Energy and Commerce portion, which costs more than $188 billion. The entire Biden relief package spans 12 House Committees and costs a total of $1.9 trillion. 

This legislation only furthers dependence on the federal government and that is not how we recover from the pandemic. We need to get our economy fully reopened and Americans back to work.

MOURNING THE LOSS OF REP. RON WRIGHT
￼

I was devastated to hear of the passing of my colleague and a dedicated public servant, Congressman Ron Wright from Texas earlier this week. Christie and I are praying for his family, staff, and loved ones during this difficult time.

VACCINE ROLLOUT SUCCESS IN OK 
￼
  Thanks to the hard work of leading healthcare experts, dedicated state officials, and Operation Warp Speed, Oklahoma is a TOP 10 state for coronavirus vaccine distribution in the United States. Unsurprisingly, Oklahoma’s data-driven, well-coordinated approach to vaccine distribution is surpassing the vast majority of states, including many Democrat run states and localities.  THE BIDEN PLAN IS A BAD DEAL 
￼
 Despite President Biden’s calls for unity, the radical Left are continuing their all-or-nothing crusade of wasteful government spending, blue state bailouts, and burdensome regulations that hinder our economic recovery from the pandemic. Congressional Democrats are using what’s called the budget reconciliation process to pass a massive $1.9 trillion “relief” bill, which will fund their socialist agenda.
We cannot afford to write blank checks that will ultimately fall on the backs of hard-working families across the country. The proposed Biden “Stimulus” Plan, combined with the relief bills that have already been signed into law, will cost more than $17,000 per person, which is roughly $69,000 for a family of four. With more than $1 trillion from previous relief bills that has yet to be spent, saddling future generations with more debt in the name of “relief” is reckless.  OK ON ZOOM This week, I was grateful to have the chance to speak with so many wonderful advocates who are advancing meaningful causes in the Second District and around the country. While I regret not being able to meet with constituents in person, Zoom allows for safe and convenient connectivity.  If you would like to request a meeting with me, please click here.  
￼
I heard from members of the National Federation of the Blind of Oklahoma and discussed how legislators can best improve accessibility around the United States.
￼
I spoke with representatives from the National Sorghum Producers to talk about agricultural issues, including what congress can do to support farmers and manufacturers.
￼
I was privileged to speak with members of the Oklahoma Water Resources center to discuss the importance of the Water Resources Research Act and various projects around the state.
￼
I was honored to meet with the Special Olympics of Oklahoma to hear about their incredible efforts to enhance the lives of people living with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

WHERE ARE YOU IN DISTRICT 2? 
￼
Communities all across the Second Congressional District of Oklahoma are full of things that make them unique and I want to highlight some of them. Every week on my Facebook page, I will post an up-close photo of a landmark somewhere in the district with a clue to where it is. I encourage everyone to put their best guess in the comments. The correct answer will be right here, in my weekly e-newsletter.
￼

This landmark is Starr Springs in Stilwell. It produces 500,000 gallons of water a day and was the main source of water for Stilwell for many years. Congratulations to Mike Brown for being the first one to guess correctly. 

Stay in touch by visiting my Facebook and Twitter pages and as always, don’t hesitate to contact me if I can help in any way. 
Thank you, ￼

2/13/21 12:04,Rep. Grothman Newsletter- Vitamin D Resolution,"￼

 
Vitamin D Resolution
 
On Thursday, I introduced a House Resolution to recognize the significant role vitamin D may play in the fight against COVID-19.
 
Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, I have shared research about the possible benefits of vitamin D for COVID-19 prevention, referencing medical research studies out of Northwestern University, University of Chicago, and Trinity College in Dublin, Ireland, to name a few. These studies show a strong correlation between vitamin D deficiencies and negative COVID-19 patient outcomes, including severe symptoms, hospital stays, ICU admittance, and overall mortality rate. Furthermore, the studies suggest those with healthy vitamin D levels are likely to fare much better against COVID-19 infection because of the benefits vitamin D intake can have for overall respiratory health and immune response.
 
This past September, Dr. Anthony Fauci endorsed taking vitamin D supplements for immune system health and function. In December, 120 health, science, and medical experts from the U.S., U.K., and Europe sent an open letter to world governments stating that there is clear evidence that Vitamin D reduces COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations, and deaths.
 
During the early stages of COVID-19, the world was in need of a treatment for this virus while we awaited a safe, effective vaccine. While we now have vaccines to prevent COVID-19, not everyone has access to them yet, there are two existing COVID variants we know of, and people are still dying from the illness every day.
 
We have been told to listen to the science regarding COVID-19 since its inception. Now, 120 doctors from several of the world’s most prestigious medical institutions concur that there is overwhelming evidence that vitamin D can be effective in decreasing the severity of COVID-19, but our government’s top public health agencies still have not pursued this credible lead. The unwillingness of these agencies to investigate this lead has undoubtedly cost many lives.
 
I am once again calling on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and National Institutes of Health (NIH) to study the connection between vitamin D deficiencies and COVID-19 and let the public know how this could help in our fight against the virus, just as they have with other prevention methods during the pandemic.
  
 
Workplace Choice for Individuals with Disabilities
 
During my time as a state legislator, I made it a point to be an advocate for individuals with disabilities. The love, laughter, and pride they bring to everyone around them is something to be cherished and celebrated. I have taken this attitude with me to Washington, DC and continue to look out for their best interest.
 
Democrats have included the elimination of Section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act in the stimulus package they are currently pushing through Congress. This section of the Fair Labor Standards Act allows certain organizations, known as Community Rehabilitation Providers (CRPs) to pay individuals with disabilities a special minimum wage. Some balk at the prospect of paying someone a special minimum wage, but the reality of the situation is different from the theory.
 
I introduced an amendment during the House Committee on Education and Labor markup of the FY2021 budget bill that would maintain Section 14(c) and the employment opportunities for individuals with disabilities it provides. Sadly, this amendment was swiftly rejected by the Democrat-controlled Committee. Click below to watch me introduce my amendment and speak to the importance of preserving workplace choice and flexibility for individuals with disabilities.
  
 
￼
 
  
Here are some other common misconceptions about CRPs:
 
	•	Q: Don't individuals with disabilities deserve enough money to live?
	•	A: Yes. However, individuals who work at CRPs under 14(c) certificates have access to benefits like Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid.
 
	•	Q: Why do these individuals work at a CRP if they don't need the money?
	•	A: For anyone, having a steady job and earning a paycheck is a point of pride. These individuals deserve the dignity that comes from feeling productive and contributing to society.
 
	•	Q: Why don't these individuals get a job outside of the CRP? 
	•	A: Many do! CRPs are set up to assist individuals with disabilities in their work and teach them valuable skills, including how to operate in the workplace. Many people work for a CRP for a period of time, then use those skills to get a job elsewhere. Most people who do gain employment elsewhere, however, are only able to work four or five hours per week, so many retain their job at the CRP in addition to working part-time for another employer.
 
	•	Q: Shouldn't individuals with disabilities be paid $15/hour instead of the CRP's profits going toward making the executives richer?
	•	A: CRPs are most often non-profit and money they do make is reinvested back into the company to assist the employees. I have been told separately and on more than one occasion by different CRPs in Wisconsin's Sixth District that if government regulations require CRPs to pay $15/hour, they would likely be forced to lay-off all employees and close their doors permanently.
 
	•	Q: Why would it be bad if CRPs closed permanently?
	•	A: The individuals who work there would lose their job and many would be relegated to adult daycare. Employees of CRPs all over the Sixth District have told me that while it's nice to have a paycheck and some spending money, their favorite part about having a job is that they get to be with their friends at work. This support system is not available to them with other employers, which is why many have more than one job.
 
Oversight Committee Amendments
 
On Friday, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform held its own markup on sections of the FY2021 budget bill that fall under the committee's purview, including $350 billion earmarked for state and local governments. To these sections, I offered three amendments.
 
The first would help restore the jobs lost by President Biden's misguided decision to shut down construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline. We are in a recession due to COVID-19 and on day one, President Biden issued an executive order that will cost our country at least 11,000 jobs, hundreds of which are in Wisconsin. My amendment would ensure that funds are not distributed until the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline resumes.
 
The second would ensure sanctuary cities and jurisdictions are not rewarded for refusing to follow federal immigration law. These cities include Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, Baltimore and dozens more large, medium, and small cities throughout the country. Those jurisdictions do not cooperate with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials and decline to comply with lawfully issued orders to hold individuals (these orders are called “detainers”) from federal law enforcement agencies, like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), meaning dangerous gang members are then released back into their communities to reoffend. Just last year in Baltimore, a 16-year-old girl was murdered. Five suspects were charged with murder in the first degree, assault in the first degree, kidnapping, conspiracy to commit first degree assault, and conspiracy to commit kidnapping. ICE issued detainers on three of these individuals. In addition to being illegally present in the United States, they are members of the ruthless MS-13 gang. Two of these suspects had previous ICE detainers placed on them for past crimes but were released because of sanctuary policies. These criminal illegal immigrants and dangerous MS-13 gang members should have never had the opportunity to murder this teenage girl. My amendment would prohibit federal funding to areas that ignore these commonsense laws. 
 
The third would prevent a federal bailout of chronically mismanaged state and local public pension funds. For example, the Illinois state public pension fund is in disrepair because of misguided decisions made by the people in charge of the fund. On the opposite side of the spectrum, Wisconsin's state public pension fund is healthy because it has been managed responsibly. My amendment would prohibit COVID-19 funding from being used to bailout these mismanaged state and local public pension funds.
 
Unfortunately, the Democrat-controlled House Committee on Oversight and Reform did not adopt any of my amendments.

Let's Talk About the Minimum Wage!
Para leer en español, haz clic aquí.  Dear Lindsey,
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic in El Paso and our country have been catastrophic and deeply painful. The pandemic has taken hundreds of thousands of lives and unleashed economic hardships our country was unprepared for. Millions of Americans are out of work and facing housing and food insecurity.
My colleagues in Congress and I have worked to pass COVID-19 relief packages to ensure unemployed El Pasoans are able to receive federal unemployment benefits, tenants are able to keep their homes, and families are able to keep food on their table. While our emergency COVID-19 relief packages have fallen far short of meaningfully addressing the disproportionate effects of the pandemic on communities like El Paso, the Biden administration introduced the American Rescue Plan to tackle the public health and economic crisis.
The American Rescue Plan would provide direct assistance to households by $1,400 per person and nutrition assistance to families struggling to get by. This legislative package would also expand access to affordable health care and reliable childcare, extend unemployment benefits, and help our country recover. Last week, the House and Senate passed budget resolutions to pave the way for the American Rescue Plan and we are working to advance this legislation. As soon as my House colleagues and I pass the American Rescue Plan, we will send it to the Senate for further action, and to President Biden to sign into law.
As a part of the American Rescue Plan, Democrats are working to secure a provision to gradually raise the federal minimum wage to increase $15 per hour by 2025. Through this provision, the minimum wage would increase to $9.50 an hour this year, then to $11 next year, $12.50 in 2023, $14 in 2024, and then $15 in 2025. The current $7.25 per hour minimum wage makes it nearly impossible for a worker to afford basic necessities and support their families – especially in the midst of a devastating pandemic.
El Paso’s poverty rate is one of the highest in Texas. Gradually increasing the minimum wage will not only benefit our workers but also allow our businesses to adjust to the increase. I support raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025 and would like to hear from you. Please take a few minutes to fill out my survey below.

Testing, Vaccines, and Additional Information
The fight against COVID-19 is far from over, and this is not the time to let our guard down. We have to do our part and stay home unless we absolutely need to leave for an essential activity. We all have a role to play in slowing the spread and protecting ourselves, our family, and our community. 
New information about COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccine rollout plan is coming out daily, please visit my resource page on my website for the latest updates, recommendations from the CDC, and a Frequently Asked Questions section to know the latest. Additionally, visit the sites below to stay up to date.
The CDC provides updates on the virus and safety information for the public and healthcare professionals, as well as Frequently Asked Questions available here. 
The City of El Paso has a hotline for residents to call for more information regarding COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccine. The number is 915-21-COVID, or 915-212-6843.
If you need to get tested because you believe you’ve been exposed to COVID-19 or are experiencing symptoms, please get tested. The City of El Paso also offers mobile testing centers throughout the city that are now open and are free of charge for any symptomatic or asymptomatic person. So, whether you are exhibiting symptoms or not, you can get tested! For more information on locations and operating hours, please click here. 
Currently, the City of El Paso is administering COVID-19 vaccines to El Pasoans who meet the 1A and 1B criteria. Phase 1A recipients include frontline healthcare workers and residents in long-term care facilities. Phase 1B recipients include people 65 years of age and older and people 16 years of age and older with at least one chronic medical condition that puts them at increased risk for severe illness or death from COVID-19. If you fall into one of these categories, you may now be able to receive a vaccine depending on supplies and can pre-register on their website, or by calling their COVID-19 hotline at 915-212-6843. Vaccines have also been distributed to other local providers and I encourage you to visit the Texas Department of State Health Services website to find a provider near you.
Lastly, please encourage your family and neighbors to subscribe to my newsletter, so I can provide them with timely updates. For news throughout the week, you can also follow me on Facebook and Twitter at @RepEscobar.
The safety and well-being of you and your loved ones is of the utmost importance. If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact my office via email at Veronica.Escobar@mail.house.gov or by phone at 915-541-1400.

Backing America's Energy Producers
￼
￼
￼
￼
The world's demand for energy is growing. That's a good thing. However, the question remains: Who is going to meet that demand? The answer should be America's energy producers. We have a strong energy sector that is built on American businesses. We must continue to support them as they protect our national security interests while countries like Russia and Iran compete against us on the world stage.

Strengthening our energy standing is also about the American worker. Now is not the time to cut good-paying jobs and raise energy prices.

Last week, I spoke alongside Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, Congressman Kevin Brady, and others at the Port of Houston about why the Biden Administration's recent energy policies are harmful to the State of Texas and the nation. You can watch my remarks HERE.

I was grateful for the recent opportunity to speak at the Corpus Christi Right to Life Apologetics conference. 
I delivered a legislative update to this group that represents part of the pro-life movement in Corpus Christi, sharing with them the ways our office is influencing pro-life legislation in Congress. I got my start in grassroots, so I know how effective grassroots groups can be for influencing federal and even global policy. I appreciate citizens actively involving themselves in protecting life.

The right to life is essential, God-given, and inalienable. Congress should do everything it can to protect the preborn.

$3 Million Grant to Port of Victoria

I'm excited to announce that the Economic Development Administration (EDA) awarded a $3 million grant to the Port of Victoria. This grant will allow the Port to construct a 1.9-mile rail loop and a 2,000-foot ladder track to serve existing and future port customers. In turn, this will help the region’s economic resiliency and growth as the Port of Victoria expands. 

Texas railways and infrastructure are vital to our state’s and nation’s economic success, and I’m glad to call this grant a victory for our part of South Texas. By expanding its rail operating capacity and creating new jobs, the Port of Victoria will continue to be a major contributor to economic recovery and growth for the Crossroads area and the State of Texas.

The Port of Victoria’s rail project will be vital to our region as we continue to recover from the past few years’ hurricanes and COVID-19. I was glad to write a letter of support for the funding to the EDA last year. Additionally, my office has staff dedicated to assisting communities, schools, businesses, and families as they seek federal funding, and if we can help, we want to hear about it.
￼

COVID Vaccine Update

Beginning in January, Texas established large vaccination sites or hubs around the state. The goal of these hubs is to provide more people the vaccine and a simpler way to sign up for an appointment. Providers will focus on vaccinating areas and populations hardest hit by COVID‑19. Phase 1A and 1B individuals are eligible to receive a vaccine at these hubs, regardless of where they reside. 
	•	Phase 1A: Front-line healthcare workers and residents at long-term care facilities.  
	•	Phase 1B: People over 65 or with a chronic medical condition that puts them at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19. 

In our district, there are currently three hubs:
	•	Bastrop County: A+ Life Style Medical Group. Call (866) 268-2289. 
	•	Neuces County: Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District. Call (361) 826-7200, option 2. Driscoll Health System is partnering with them. 
	•	Victoria County: Victoria County Public Health Department. Call (361) 578-6281. 

The state also has created the Texas COVID-19 Vaccine Availability Map that you can use to see which providers have the vaccine and contact them to get scheduled. 
￼

In Other News:

	•	President Abraham Lincoln once said, “Be sure you put your feet in the right place, then stand firm.”  He served our country at its most divided point in history, where identity and relationships were determined by which side someone was on - a time very similar to what we are seeing now. President Lincoln encouraged people not to seek if God was on their “side,” but to seek God’s side, because “God is always right.”  We should take the wisdom of one of the United States’ greatest presidents by seeking truth and standing firm in that truth, especially as we honor his birthday on February 12th. 

	•	Do you know a teen who has a passion for leadership preparedness? FEMA is accepting applications for its 2021 Youth Preparedness Council. Since 2012, FEMA has brought together young leaders who are interested in supporting disaster preparedness and making a difference in their communities by completing disaster preparedness projects nationally and locally. The application period is open to teens in grades 8-11 till 11:59 p.m. PT on March 7th. Selected candidates will be notified in May 2021. Interested students may apply online HERE.

Calling For Justice And Reforms
 
  Dear Neighbor,
 Over the past week, we continued our fight for transparency, accountability, and justice for the families of New Yorkers who lost a parent or grandparent because of Gov. Cuomo’s disastrous nursing home orders. The latest data suggests nearly 15,000 souls were lost -- a 63% increase from New York State’s original figures.   Even more astounding, just this week the Governor’s top staff member, Melissa DeRosa, admitted that the Governor intentionally concealed unfavorable information about nursing home COVID-19 deaths out of concern that the data would be used against his Administration.  This stunning admission reveals Governor Cuomo’s obstruction of a federal investigation and abuse of power.  We are continuing our efforts to help demonstrate the true depth of the Governor’s misconduct by calling for justice and reform in the halls of Washington.
 During the second day of the Ways & Means Committee markups, we offered an amendment to promote fundamental accountability by requiring governors who receive federal support to attest that the data their states are reporting to the public and sharing with federal agencies is as accurate as possible.
 
The amendment is needed in light of states, most prominently New York, where it took months of fighting, a court order, and a report from the New York Attorney General to reveal the depths of Gov. Cuomo’s disastrous nursing home edicts and efforts to obfuscate the truth.   We will continue this fight in honor of these families and the loved ones that they lost. This cannot be allowed to happen again.  Until Next Time,  Tom

My First 30 Days

Friends,
 
This week marked my first 30 days in Congress. While it certainly didn't start off how I would've expected, I've learned a lot already and am hard at work for all of you.

On Wednesday, I was able to draw attention to the lack of infrastructure needed to rapidly deploy the COVID-19 vaccine in the Lowcountry and across America. Many elderly citizens and rural communities don't have the stable Internet connection needed to schedule vaccinations online. Even when they do, we lack the cold-storage facilities needed to keep large amounts of the vaccine nearby to meet demand. 

You can watch my full testimony before the Transportation & Infrastructure Committee here or below:

I'm happy to say I've received commitments from colleagues on both sides of the aisle to work with me to address this issue as part of legislation to help our nation finally beat COVID-19 once and for all. 
 
But, at almost every step of my committee work, I watched amendment after amendment get shut down. Most of us were there to work, to do our duty to help the American people fight COVID-19 without bankrupting the next generation. But, the higher powers simply weren't interested in hearing our thoughts. 
 
Instead, they were committed to funneling over $350 billion to states to supposedly cover ""revenue shortfalls"", all while those states haven't even spent all of the $150 billion Congress sent them last year. This isn't about helping states fight COVID-19. It's about forcing all of us to bail out state governments who refused to cut spending on useless programs and focus on COVID relief.
 
To top it all off, countless children across America are suffering academically, physically, and emotionally from school closures. The data and science informs us, when precautions are taken, schools can and should be a safe place to learn. Parents should have every opportunity to educate them at home or at school; it should be their choice. 
 
The Lowcountry cannot afford Congress to waste another second. Countless Americans are struggling to support themselves and their families, and Washington is failing them. I'm committed to working hard to help Washington roll up it's sleeves and get busy working to defeat COVID-19 and rebuild our nation.
 
Sincerely, 
￼

Missing 2019 Tax Refunds Finally Start to Reach Lowcountry

ABC News 4 fielded more than 150 calls, texts and emails from viewers about similar issues and sent them over to Rep. Nancy Mace's office. Mace reached out to the IRS, and now, some people are gaining clarity to reasons why and even a couple checks have came in the mail.

Rep. Mace: The kids aren't alright - open schools now.

When COVID-19 first reared its ugly head in the United States last spring, we immediately closed schools, with no knowledge of how it would affect our children. Over the course of the last year, kids needing mental health counseling jumped dramatically, with emergency rooms seeing a 24% increase in mental health-related visits from children ages 5 to 11 compared to last year. These aren’t just statistics. I’m seeing it firsthand.

2/13/21 15:27,COVID-19 VACCINE UPDATE,"
￼
 
DATA COMPILED ON FEBRUARY 12, 2021
Dear Friend, 
Information about the COVID-19 vaccinations in Florida has been limited and, at times, confusing. My team and I have compiled the most up-to-date information about vaccine distribution in our community, and I will continue to update you as soon as we get any new details. To better understand exactly what is happening in Central Florida, I would like to hear from you about any difficulties you have experienced when trying to register for a vaccine appointment or to obtain information about vaccines. Please fill out the survey at the bottom of this newsletter so my office can better assist you.  
I recently secured a bipartisan briefing for the Florida congressional delegation from the State of Florida on its vaccination rollout, which revealed numerous problems with the state’s effort to vaccinate residents in a swift and organized manner. 
An insufficient supply of vaccines continues to be a problem in Florida and many other states. That’s why I’ve urged congressional leaders to prioritize the swift passage of an emergency, vaccine-focused bill that will help accomplish President Biden’s goal of 100 million shots during the first 100 days of his administration. We can pass this bill at the same time as we work urgently to enact more comprehensive COVID legislation through the reconciliation process. 
In addition, I’ve urged the Biden administration to modify the formula it uses to distribute vaccine doses to U.S. states and territories. The current formula is based solely on a state’s population over age 18. That disadvantages states like Florida, since we have a relatively large population of seniors age 65 and over who need to be prioritized for vaccination, especially now that more contagious strains of the virus are circulating. I’ve asked the administration to update its allocation formula to send additional doses to states like Florida with large senior populations, who are the most likely to suffer serious health consequences as a result of the virus.        
Rest assured I will keep fighting to get more shots in the arms of more Floridians and to put more money in the pockets of working families until we’ve defeated the health and economic crises caused by COVID-19.
￼

Florida is currently in Phase 1 of vaccine distribution. This means that all providers administering any COVID-19 vaccine shall only vaccinate the following populations:  
	•	Health care personnel with direct patient contact
	•	Long-term care facility residents and staff
	•	Persons 65 years of age and older
	•	Persons deemed extremely vulnerable to COVID-19 by hospital providers
While these groups are being prioritized, the number of vaccine doses is limited, which has increased wait times. As more doses become available, the state will open up eligibility to other groups.
For a complete list of who is eligible, please click here.    
￼

Each county is making progress to implement their vaccination plan at a different pace, based on population size and local availability of the vaccine. Below is a list of current vaccination sites and tips on how you can stay up-to-date since information is changing rapidly. 
VACCINE APPOINTMENTS
	•	There are many vaccination sites in Florida. Some are located in malls and convention centers, while others are beginning to open in stores such as Publix and Walmart. Each location has a different system for signing up to receive a vaccine dose, and some even show a running list of appointments that are available because people who were previously registered have cancelled. 
	◦	To see most vaccination locations by county, click here. 
	◦	Once appointments become available at Publix locations in Orange and Seminole counties, you will be able to view them by clicking here. 
	◦	Once appointments become available at Walmart locations in Orange County, you will be able to view them by clicking here. 
	◦	Once appointments become available at Sam’s Club locations in Orange County, you will be able to view them by clicking here. 
ORANGE COUNTY INFO
	•	You can sign up for text or email alerts, download a phone or tablet application for alerts, see appointment availability, and check to see if there are any cancelled appointments available at the Orange County government website by clicking here. 
SEMINOLE COUNTY INFO
	•	You can check on vaccine appointment availability and get updates on which groups are eligible for vaccination at both this website and this website.
￼

While the process has been slow, the number of people being vaccinated in Florida is rising. Here is where things stand in the state of Florida:

I have heard from many Central Floridians who have encountered problems finding clear information about who is eligible, how to register, and the number of vaccines available in their communities. Listening to you is one of the most important parts of my job, so I want to hear directly from you about how you think Florida is handling the COVID-19 vaccine rollout.

Legislative Lineup
 
Dear Friends,
My team and I have wasted no time engaging in the legislative process. I’m proud to have introduced 4 bills and cosponsored 45 other pieces of legislation. I’d like to highlight just a few of the important legislative items we’ve already tackled.
 
HR 859, the Protecting American Energy Jobs Act
On February 6th, I introduced the Protecting American Energy Jobs Act. The bill would repeal President Biden's job-killing executive mandates, ensure reliable and affordable energy supplies for future generations, and foster economic growth and job creation in rural communities. I’m honored that this piece of legislation has received the support of 23 of my colleagues in the House and more than 30 local and national organizations.
 
Standing for Life
One of the promises I made to voters was to always stand for unborn children. During my first month in office, I cosponsored 12 pieces of prolife legislation including the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, the Life at Conception Act, and the Defund Planned Parenthood Act. On the 48th anniversary of Roe v. Wade, I spoke on the House floor about the importance of this issue and told a personal story.
￼
 
Protecting and Growing the Bureau of Land Management Headquarters
In 2019, the Bureau of Land Management’s Headquarters made the move to Grand Junction. This made sense for a wide variety of reasons. The establishment of the headquarters in Grand Junction has reduced the number of long cross-country flights, improved training, delegated more responsibility to employees in the field, improved customer service and coordination with local communities, ensured better decisions earlier in the decision-making process, reduced commute times for employees, and provided good-paying local jobs. On Monday, I joined U.S. Senators Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper, Colorado Governor Jared Polis and local community leaders for a biprtisan roundtable on this issue. I will continue to work with local, state, and federal leaders on both sides of the aisle to keep the Bureau of Land Management Headquarters in Grand Junction. 
_____________________
 
 
Hearing from Home
There’s nothing like returning home to meet with the people of the Third Congressional District. This past week, I spoke with small business owners and discussed the challenges they are facing. Their main concern: the government keeps getting in the way. One such instance was my meeting with Mike Pacheco who owns Papa Jose’s Union Café in Pueblo. He, like many in the food industry, has been hurt by workers purposefully remaining unemployed in order to receive increased unemployment checks. Government should never incentivize unemployment, and I assured him I understood the issue and would fight for small business.     
￼
 
On Tuesday, the Ranking Member of the House Armed Services Committee's Subcommittee on Readiness, Congressman Doug Lamborn, joined me for a tour of the Pueblo Chemical Depot. The Depot is an important employer for Pueblo supporting more than 1,500 direct jobs.The Pueblo Chemical Depot also plays a critical role in fulfilling international treaty obligations. I want to thank Colonel Cobb for the tour and his leadership for the Depot and our community.
￼
_____________________
 
 
Boebert on the Border
In January, I joined U.S. Representatives Warren Davidson, Bob Gibbs, Andrew Clyde, Matt Rosendale, Bob Good, Glenn Grothman, and Barry Moore on a tour of the United State-Mexico border. The congressional delegation, hosted by House Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs, visited Sasabe, Nogales, and Sierra Vista. While on the tour, I met with Border Patrol, customs officials, other local law enforcement, and the mom of a police officer killed by an illegal alien.
￼
 
I want to thank Chairman Biggs and his entire team for getting boots on the ground so my colleagues and I could see these issues firsthand and better understand the urgency of securing our southern border. Under President Trump’s leadership, illegal immigration was the lowest it had been in 17 years. The Trump administration achieved this success because they understood the actual problems and addressed them. So far under President Biden, the only actions he has taken regarding immigration involve amnesty and implementing a ban on using the term ‘illegal alien.’ It’s almost laughable, but what won’t be a laughing matter is the increase of illegal drugs, violence and human trafficking that will result from Biden’s amnesty policies and his unwillingness to secure the border.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
February 13, 2021
Risch Votes Against Conviction in Senate Impeachment Trial 
WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senator Jim Risch (R-Idaho) voted against conviction in the Senate impeachment trial of former-President Donald Trump. Risch issued the following statement upon the conclusion of the trial: 
“The purpose of the constitutional authority of impeachment is to remove the president from office. The person Democrats attempted to impeach was no longer in office. The United States Senate has no jurisdiction over a private citizen and thus impeachment was and is impossible.
“It’s time we stop the political hate and vitriol and move forward wiser and stronger just as America has countless times before.""

2/13/21 16:31,Why I voted to convict,"￼
February 13, 2021
Dear Friend,
What happened on January 6, 2021, was not a spontaneous event. This violent and bloody attack on our democracy was cultivated by months of Donald Trump repeating a completely baseless lie of election fraud, over and over and over again. It was cultivated through years of his encouraging violence by White Supremacists and extremist groups like the ""Proud Boys."" This was an intentional act. Donald Trump never put America first.  What he put first was his hold on power--our democracy and elections be damned.  I am deeply grateful that my colleagues and the Vice President were not murdered by the terrorist mob on January 6th, but it is only thanks to the dedication of Capitol and Metro police that we escaped harm. However, let's never forget that a Capitol Police officer was murdered and that we lost two more police officers in the aftermath.  Many members of Congress are literally scared to death of this man who has taken over the Republican party and turned it into a dangerous and violent cult of personality. I get it. We all felt fear when we saw what that mob was capable of doing to us and to America.  I was fearful that day that my sons might never see their father again. But fear will not defend this beautiful democracy. We have to stand up to this bully and take back our nation governed by laws and elections. The best way to do that was to convict Donald Trump for his crimes and relegate him to the dark corner of history where he belongs. 
I voted to do just that today.
Sincerely,
￼

2/13/21 16:58,43 Senators,"￼
Dear Friend,
 
It’s a sad day for our nation when elected officials put their own political interests ahead of the future of our democracy. That’s what 43 senators just did. They betrayed their oaths to support and defend the Constitution.
 
The case against Donald Trump was overwhelming. Videos, social media posts, and transcripts show that he incited a violent mob of his supporters to storm the Capitol in an attempt to overturn the election.
 
As officers were beaten, stabbed, and killed, he did nothing. As his own Vice President and members of Congress fled for their lives, he continued to fan the flames. And as the seat of our democracy turned into a warzone, he told the terrorists, “we love you.”
 
Donald Trump is guilty. You know it. I know it. Even the Senators who voted to acquit him know it. That’s why many of them pleaded to him directly to call off the insurgents and end the attack.
 
Those Republican senators didn’t have the courage to vote their conscience. They’ll have to explain that vote to their constituents and to American people who, unlike them, don’t live their lives in fear of losing re-election.
 
Sincerely,

2/13/21 17:59,I Voted For Accountability,"￼  
Dear Friend,   It’s impossible to watch the footage that was presented by the House Managers on the floor of the Senate this week as part of the impeachment trial, and not come to the conclusion that Donald Trump was responsible for inciting the deadly attack on our Capitol. 
The facts speak for themselves: Donald Trump spent years cheerleading violence and intimidation as political tools and months spreading conspiracies and lies about the election being stolen. He stoked the fury of his supporters, repeatedly telling them that they had to ‘fight like hell’ to overturn the election. He rescheduled his rally to coincide with the electoral vote count, and then sent his mob to the Capitol. He did nothing to stop the attack once it started and reportedly celebrated it at the White House. Since the attack, he has shown absolutely no remorse for the death and destruction it caused. 
All of the facts point to one inescapable conclusion. The insurrection was not to Donald Trump a terrible tragedy, it was exactly what he wanted. ‘We love you,’ he told the rioters who had just murdered a police officer and erected gallows to hang his Vice President. Donald Trump attacked the very foundation of our constitutional democracy by trying to seize power through lies and violence. Thus, I conclude that former President Trump did incite the insurrection, and I voted for his conviction today. 
In the months ahead, I will do all in my power to repair our republic and advance the vision of government of, by, and for the people. To that goal, I will work to pass S.1, the For the People Act, which tackles the dark money, partisan gerrymandering, and voter suppression that seeks to erect a blockade to prevent many Americans from voting. Congress has a grave responsibility to pass it without delay.  All my best,  Jeff

Sen. Rick Scott Honors the Victims of Marjory Stoneman Douglas, Continues the Fight to Make Students Safer in the Classroom
￼
On February 14, 2018, 17 innocent lives were lost in a senseless attack on Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Today, Senator Rick Scott joins Floridians with heavy heart to honor the victims and share support for the families immeasurably impacted on that day three years ago.   Since that tragic day, Senator Rick Scott has worked to pass effective and meaningful measures to keep our schools safe and ensure no family has to experience a tragedy like that ever again. As Governor, he worked closely with many of the victims’ families, as well as law enforcement, education and mental health experts, to pass the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act to provide additional state resources to keep our schools safe. As Senator, he’s working to build on these efforts with the Luke and Alex School Safety Act, to codify into law the Federal Clearinghouse on School Safety, which informs parents and educators on expert recommendations and best practices that schools can implement to improve school security. Senator Scott will never stop working to protect our students and educators, and ensure they have a safe environment to learn and succeed.  Read more on Senator Scott’s efforts to keep our students safe below.

In recognition of the third anniversary of the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14, 2018 in Parkland, Florida, Senators Rick Scott and Marco Rubio introduced a resolution honoring the 17 innocent lives lost that day, which was unanimously adopted by the Senate.   Senator Scott also spoke on the Senate floor this week on this resolution and to honor the lives of the victims.

Senators Rick Scott, Ron Johnson and Marco Rubio Introduce the Luke and Alex School Safety Act 
Last month, Senator Rick Scott joined Senators Ron Johnson and Marco Rubio to reintroduce the Luke and Alex School Safety Act. This legislation would codify into law the Federal Clearinghouse on School Safety, which informs parents and educators on expert recommendations and best practices that schools can implement to improve school security. The clearinghouse also provides information on available federal resources and grant programs that can be used toward these safety measures.   The Luke and Alex School Safety Act is named after Luke Hoyer and Alex Schachter, two students killed in the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School attack in Parkland, Fla. Luke and Alex’s parents, along with the group Stand with Parkland, have fought tirelessly for Congress to take common sense steps like the clearinghouse to prepare schools and protect students from harm in the event of an attack.  Senator Rick Scott said, “Nearly three year ago, we lost 17 innocent lives in the tragic shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. I think about those lives lost, and the families impacted, every day. Since that horrible day, I’ve worked closely with many of the victims’ family members as Governor and now as Senator to ensure no child, educator, or family has to experience that again. This legislation, the Luke and Alex School Safety Act, honors two of the victims, Luke Hoyer and Alex Schachter, and builds on our work to keep schools safe and prevent another tragedy. I will never stop working to protect our students and educators, and ensure they have a safe environment to learn and succeed.""  Read more from Senator Johnson’s office HERE.

Friends,

The recent arrivals of COVID-19 vaccines are the first light at the end of the global pandemic's tunnel. Moving forward, our main focus needs to be the distribution and administration of as many of these vaccines to as many people as quickly as possible.

This week, I had the opportunity to visit a local Discount Drug Mart in Concord to learn more about their preparations to begin vaccinating Northeast Ohioans. Discount Drug Mart is among the 21 national pharmacy chains and independent networks receiving COVID-19 vaccine shipments from the federal government this week. Pharmacies like Discount Drug Mart are critical to ensuring that vaccines are easily accessible to the public. I was impressed by the preparations taken to store and distribute these vital vaccinations. Each vaccination brings us one step closer to stopping the spread of this virus and restoring our way of life, and I am proud of the progress being made in our Buckeye communities.

Saluting Our Courageous Veterans Through Good Times and Tragedies


It is always an honor to meet with veterans from our district and celebrate their service. This week, I had the privilege of reuniting with Bob Zonneville, a World War II veteran who served as a combat trooper in the 8th Infantry Division across France, Belgium, Holland, Luxembourg and Germany. His commitment and hard work earned him the rank of staff sergeant, and subsequently he was awarded two Purple Hearts and the European Theater of Operations Medal with four Bronze Stars for each of the four major campaigns he participated in. I had the opportunity to first meet Bob last year, and I was honored to celebrate his 96th birthday with him this past week. As the son of a World War II veteran, I am always gracious when I meet heroes like Bob, and it was an honor to present him with a flag flown over the U.S. Capitol to celebrate his extraordinary heroism. 

Along with the celebration of Mr. Zonneville's birthday, I was also humbled to meet the families of the late Gold Star recipients Sergeant Wolfgang K. Weninger and Staff Sergeant Kyle McKee, and present them with flags flown in their honor. The loss of these two remarkable men reminds us that the freedoms we enjoy are not free. These brave men in uniform are not just remembered as true patriots, but also as brothers, fathers, and sons, to those who loved them the most. Meeting these Gold Star Families was a true honor and privilege. As a community, let us continue to keep these courageous families in our prayers, along with others who have lost loved ones serving our great nation.

Supporting and Informing Northeast Ohio Small Businesses

On Wednesday, I joined the Small Business Administration (SBA) in hosting a federal relief update webinar for small businesses in Northeast Ohio. The virtual event addressed the most recent COVID-19 relief package passed by Congress and updated information regarding programs like the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which have served as lifelines for small businesses across the nation. I was happy to join the SBA to keep constituents across Ohio’s 14th Congressional District informed as we work to support their businesses, protect their jobs, and reignite our economy. As of February 7th, nationally 1.3 million PPP loans were approved for a total of $101 billion, and I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in Congress to further support Ohio businesses as we continue to navigate the pandemic. You can learn more about this virtual event here. 

Celebrating Valentines' Day

I'd like to conclude by wishing everyone a joyful and safe Valentine's Day. I am lucky to have been married to my forever valentine, Kelly, for more than 30 years now.
￼

Whether in person or virtually, I hope everyone has the chance to spend some quality time with their loved ones this Valentine's Day. 

God bless and stay well,

Dave

FOLLOW THE SCIENCE AND REOPEN SCHOOLS

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has confirmed that in-person learning can be safe. In case you missed it, I wrote an op-ed this week about how we should follow the science and safely reopen schools. 

Follow the Science and Reopen Schools

Nearly a year after the world came to a halt due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are many things we still do not know about this virus. One thing we do know: Children can and should be safely back in school for in-person learning.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently confirmed that the “preponderance of available evidence” shows rapid COVID-19 spread does not occur in a school setting and instruction can be safe. With proper disinfecting procedures, mask wearing, ventilation and physical distancing, our country’s students can go back to school.

Sadly, unions and special interests have been arguing that students shouldn’t be back in classrooms, despite the educational, social, mental health and physical health consequences of staying home.

For example, the teachers’ union in Northern Virginia’s ultra-liberal Fairfax County only wants schools reopened after 14 days of zero community spread, an almost impossible metric to meet. Meanwhile, the union’s desire to keep children at home has resulted in an 83 percent increase in failing grades, with students who have disabilities seeing a 111 percent increase. Across the country, children from low-income households are also seeing a disproportionate setback to their learning opportunities.

These decisions are actively hurting children’s growth, while setting extreme metrics for a return to in-person instruction.

And it isn’t just student report cards that are experiencing turmoil. A tragic increase in student suicides drove a Las Vegas school system to reopen, and the CDC has reported a 31 percent increase in teenage mental health issues. Young kids are also experiencing worsening obesity rates during the pandemic with nearly 1 in 5 children overweight. Many of those children depend on school meals to supplement their diets and provide healthy foods. Additionally, there are concerns that increased time on a computer or tablet screen could have long-term implications on vision.

Just as we can safely reopen businesses and restaurants, we can reopen our schools too. In December, Congress allocated $82 billion to help schools reopen. Last March, Congress gave school systems $30 billion to help purchase personal protective equipment and adjust to CDC-recommended COVID-19 protocols. Yet President Biden’s chief of staff in a CNN interview sided with teachers’ unions to keep schools closed despite his own CDC saying otherwise.

Our kids deserve the best education they can get. They need to be in the classroom with their peers around them and teachers to help them learn. If this doesn’t happen, the long-term damage on our students would be irreversible.

But not everyone would be impacted. Some children have the advantage of living in an area that has reopened schools. In other areas, I’ve spoken to parents who have been forced to move their children from the public schools they love to private schools that are doing in-person learning. As we all know, not all families have the luxury to make this change. Anyone who supports equal education for all should be yelling from the rooftops that all kids need to be back in the classroom, not just some.

In the meantime, I’ll start yelling from the rooftops for them.

The next time you’re with a kid, ask what they think. I bet many will tell you they miss their friends, they are having trouble keeping up through a screen or they are tired of looking at their sibling all day.

Not bringing students back to the classroom now could disadvantage an entire generation of Americans. As a dad and grandfather, I’m not willing to stay silent.

President Biden has said children need to get back to school in his first 100 days, but we can’t afford to wait. In 100 days, most students will be at or near the end of the semester. President Biden needs to step in now and demand that our nation’s schools are fully reopened immediately.

Throughout the pandemic, we’ve heard over and over that we should follow the science, as we should. Let’s follow through on that and reopen our schools.

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL

Monday, February 8, 2021:  I’m honored to be at Calvary Day School in Savannah this morning at their regular Monday morning assembly where I recognize the girls flag football team who won the inaugural Georgia High School Association (GHSA) Class 1A-5A championship.  Under the guidance of coaches Chad Griffin and Nick Grassi, these student-athletes capped a 6-0-2 season with a thrilling victory over Portal in the championship game and were featured in a commercial during the Super Bowl. 
￼
Rep. Carter congratulates the Calvary Day School girls flag football team
Next, I head to our Savannah District office where I join in on our daily all staff conference call before heading to lunch with my good friend Mark Dana with Savannah Lodging who is serving as President of the 200 Club of the Coastal Empire.  Few sectors of our business community have been more negatively impacted during the COVID-19 pandemic than the lodging industry.  After returning to our Savannah office, I meet with a constituent who owns a yacht dealership in our district and is representing the Georgia Marine Business Association to discuss the discrepancy with sales tax on boat purchases between Georgia and surrounding states.  Afterwards, I have a virtual call with BioQ, an Atlanta-based company that offers a scalable solution to provide patients with access to easy and convenient health care services such as screenings, testing, and telehealth tools.  Next, I have an Energy and Commerce Committee (E&C) Republican member virtual briefing with ClearPath to discuss climate change and clean energy solutions before having a great call with former COVID-19 response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, Dr. Deborah Birx, on how to improve responses in future pandemics.  My final meeting of the day is a virtual call with Kalderos to discuss the 340B drug programs efficiency so that it better serves the patients who depend upon it.

Tuesday, February 9, 2021:  Once in our Savannah District Office, I have a meeting with RESULTS GA, a 40-year-old movement of passionate, committed, everyday people who try to influence political decisions that will bring an end to poverty.  Next, I join in on a Budget Committee organizational meeting where we adopt our committee rules for this session before joining in on an E&C Environment and Climate Change Subcommittee hearing on federal climate leadership.  A link to my questions can be found here. 
￼
Rep. Carter on a virtual meeting with the National Federation of the Blind of Georgia
After a virtual meeting with the National Federation of the Blind of Georgia to discuss their legislative priorities for the year, I have a phone interview with my good friend Mittie Vaughan, editor of The Pierce County Press, The Brantley County Express, The Long County Press, and The Camden County Press to discuss current Washington issues.  Next, I have a virtual call with the Georgia Pulp and Paper Workers Resource Council to discuss forestry issues before joining in on a Values Action Team (VAT) virtual call where we discuss challenges to the Hyde amendment that prevents taxpayer money to be used for abortions.  Next, I head down to downtown Savannah where I record this week’s edition of Buddy’s Briefing.

Wednesday, February 10, 2021:  My day begins with a Doctor’s Caucus briefing by the Congressional Research Services (CRS), an agency that works exclusively for the U.S. Congress providing policy and legal analysis to committees and members, regarding budget reconciliation.  Later, I have an E&C Republican member meeting as we discuss the mark-up scheduled for tomorrow for budget reconciliation in our authorizing committee.

Thursday, February 11, 2021:  I begin today with an E&C Republican member meeting as we discuss last minute preparations for the full committee meeting today.  Afterwards, I join in on what turns out to be an all day and all night mark up in the E&C Committee as we are considering legislation to be included in the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package that the Democrats are ramming through Congress.  The committee leadership divided the legislation into four sections- Public Health, Medicaid, the State Childrens' Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP), and other provisions.  Although we start today at 11:00 a.m. and finish at 11:30 p.m. with an hour break, we only finish the public health section.  During the aforementioned hour break, I join in on a GOP Conference call where we hear from each subcommittee ranking member as to the progress of budget reconciliation for the COVID-19 package in their respective subcommittee. 

Friday, February 12, 2021:  We’re back at it this morning as we have a GOP pre-meeting call to discuss today’s meeting and then begin the meeting at 11:00 a.m. We have three of the four sections left to consider today as we finished only one section during the marathon meeting yesterday.  Fortunately, today moves along swiftly compared to yesterday and we are able to complete our work by 6:30 p.m.  Combined with yesterday, we spend 19 total hours in the virtual meeting, debating dozens of amendments offered by Republicans, and passing a total of 0.  That’s certainly a far cry from President Joe Biden’s call for unity in his inaugural address.

2/14/21 10:21,Vaccination Update and Other Helpful Information,"
 
 
 

February 14, 2021
 

Dear Neighbor, 
 
Happy Valentine's Day to you and your loved ones. I love having the opportunity to serve as your voice in Washington, D.C. and to work on behalf of our community. 

While last week was a district work period, several committees- including the Energy and Commerce Committee- held virtual hearings to review the partisan pandemic relief package that was unveiled just a few hours before the committees were asked to convene and vote. This rushed, secretive and divisive behavior is part of what people hate about Washington, and I was very disappointed by my colleagues in the majority for abandoning previous efforts to unite as Americans and pass bipartisan pandemic relief. 

We all want to achieve similar goals: to restore our way of life, rebuild our economy, and renew the American Dream. However, we have dramatically different ideas about how to get there. I believe we need to achieve these goals by evaluating what has already been provided in the last 5 relief packages and then provide targeted assistance by building upon what has been working. We cannot just spend for the sake of spending without accountability and we should not be using the suffering of Americans to play politics. I want to increase the production and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine, to help small businesses and Americans who are still struggling, and to address the mental health and addiction issues that have been exacerbated during this crisis. I want to build consensus and move the country forward in a united manner. We have proven that we can be better than this, and I hope my colleagues will reverse course and join me in achieving our shared goals in a bipartisan manner.

Advocating for Seniors 

Update on Vaccinations 

Overview
As of last Wednesday, the state of Florida had vaccinated roughly 3 million people, 1.7 million of which are seniors. This represents about 35% of Florida's senior population. This is an impressive statistic and a big step in the right direction. However, we need to continually improve our distribution plan to ensure all seniors and vulnerable patients, especially those who are homebound, have the opportunity to get vaccinated. I will continue doing all I can to increase the amount of vaccine sent to Florida so we can achieve this goal.   
 
Where to Register by County
Pasco seniors have a few options for vaccination. They can register through the Pasco County health department’s portal. Then at 2:00 p.m. on Sundays the county releases appointment slots. Seniors can log on at exactly 2:00 p.m. and try to register for one of the slots. They are usually gone within 5 minutes. They can also pre-register for the state’s portal and reserve their space in line. The state will contact them once it is their turn for a vaccine. Additionally, seniors can register through Publix, Walmart, or Winn Dixie. I would suggest trying each approach until an appointment is secured.  

Pinellas seniors have similar options. They can register through the Pinellas County health department’s portal. County health officials are contacting those who have pre-registered as appointments become available.  They can also pre-register for the state’s portal and reserve their space in line. The state will contact them once it is their turn for a vaccine. Additionally, they can register through Publix and Walmart. 
 
Hillsborough seniors can pre-register for the state’s portal and reserve their space in line. The state will contact them once it is their turn for a vaccine. Additionally, they can register through Publix, Walmart, or Winn Dixie.  

*Note- there are no county residency requirement for any vaccine in the State of Florida, which means residents of all three counties can attempt to secure a slot through any of the options mentioned above. 
 
Federal Retail Pharmacy Program 

﻿Last Friday, seniors were able to begin registering for a COVID-19 vaccine through the Federal Retail Pharmacy (FRP) Program. During the first week of the FRP program, Florida received 65,300 doses of vaccine. This is in addition to the state’s regular federal weekly allocation of vaccine. Publix and Walmart/Sam’s Club will have locations in all three counties I represent (Hillsborough, Pasco, and Pinellas), while Winn-Dixie will only offer participation in Hillsborough and Pasco locations. Appointments (which are required) can be made on each pharmacy’s website. Please see links above for each pharmacy. 
 

Improving Seniors Access to Telehealth
I am excited to see the companion to our House ACCESS Bill filed in the Senate. This bipartisan legislation will help ensure seniors have access to telehealth. 
 
 

Expanding Access to Quality Healthcare

Finding Cures and Treatments

We must continue to support the research necessary to find cures and treatments for chronic, rare, and debilitating diseases. Additionally, like Operation Warp Speed, we need to streamline FDA processes to expedite review and approval of these remedies without sacrificing safety or efficacy. Watch this story to learn more. 

Tackling Addiction

The pandemic has exacerbated what was already a serious problem in our community. Pasco reported a 71% increase in overdoses in 2020. During last week's Energy and Commerce hearing I implored my colleagues to work together to address this concern. Click here to listen to my opening remarks and to hear the story of Kelly Mothershead (pictured below), a constituent of mine who is working to prevent others from experiencing the same tragic loss she has endured. 
 

Supporting Healthy Moms and Babies 
 
The United States has the highest maternal mortality rate in the developed world, with approximately 700 women dying from pregnancy-related complications every year. While we have recently taken legislative steps to address this problem, we need to use every tool at our disposal to improve health outcomes for moms and babies. Last week, I co-authored the bipartisan and bicameral Data Mapping to Save Moms’ Lives Act. This bill will empower the FCC to use data mapping to identify regions of the country where high rates of poor maternal health overlap with poor broadband access so that we can the target those areas for telehealth initiatives. Including this information into our broadband mapping will help us achieve this goal and ensure these moms get the prenatal care they deserve. Similar legislation passed the Senate last December, and we are hoping to get it across the finish line in both Chambers as quickly as possible.  
 

Helping Children
 
ICYMI- As noted in this story, my colleague and I have refiled legislation to ensure children who are struggling get the mental health treatment they need. Sadly, some communities in my district are among those with the highest suicide rates in our state. The pandemic has only exacerbated the problem. The need for this legislation is urgent. 
 

Rebuilding the Economy
 
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued a report last week determining that proposed legislation to artificially increase the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour would eliminate jobs for 1.4 million Americans, while increasing the deficit by $54 billion. Yet the Speaker and President are pushing for this measure to be included in the budget package. This is bad public policy and not the way to help Americans who are struggling. We all want to see wages rise, but this report makes clear that government intervention is not the way to achieve this goal. In fact, it would actually offer more consequences than benefits since it would result in lower and middle-income Americans losing out entirely on sources of revenue that they need.  
 
 

Prioritizing National Security

﻿In another example of focusing on divisive rather than unifying issues during his first month in office, President Biden has signed Executive Orders and issued agency directives that could jeopardize national security. A new report from Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee warns that if the Biden Administration continues to pursue this radical immigration agenda, the result will be less security at the border, reduced interior enforcement, and an increased security risk from those who wish to do us harm.  
 

Holding Big Tech Accountable
 
We have seen countless recent examples of how Big Tech has broken our sense of trust that they can be fair stewards for ensuring equitable standards of free speech and truth in public information. I understand that freedom of speech is not absolute, and believe Big Tech is right to restrict speech that incites violence; however, it should do so whether those incitements come from the right or the left of the political spectrum.  

Additionally, while private businesses do have the ability to develop terms of use on the platforms developed, operated, and monitored, blatant political bias and censorship should alarm all Americans, especially when Big Tech does so while enjoying significant legal protections by the United States Government. Section 230 grants Big Tech immunity from civil liability for content posted on its platforms. The Section 230 provision has largely been interpreted by the judicial system as justification for Big Tech to remove any content for any reason. However, if Big Tech is going to continue operating as a partisan arbitrator of the truth, the government has a duty to re-examine its relationship with Big Tech. 

﻿This should not be a partisan issue, as both the majority and minority should support impartiality and a free exchange of ideas. As the Lead Republican on the Consumer Protection Subcommittee, I will be pursuing several reform proposals which will require Big Tech to manage its platforms more responsibly, including repealing liability protections when the industry neglects its Good Samaritan obligations. When moderating content, Big Tech should be required to extend Free Speech Standards when operating under the blanket of liability protections granted under the law. I am optimistic that we can reform protections that define obligations and impartial standards with the goal of supporting a free exchange of ideas across Big Tech Platforms.   
 
 

Raising Awareness

February is National Heart Month! Here is some practical information and tips for how we can all work to have a healthier heart!
 
 
 

Consumer Protection Connection
 
Pro-Tip
 
I know some seniors are excited to finally be getting their COVID-19 vaccines, but this report highlights why it is dangerous to post your vaccination card on social media.  
 
 

Community Concentration 
 
Congratulations to WWII Veteran Murray Zolkower on the celebration of his 100th birthday. My team was honored to participate in a very special celebration of his life and service to our nation. Murry served as a medic with the highly decorated 45th Infantry Division, seeing action from the beaches of Belgium to Scotland. His unit penetrated both the Maginot and Siegfried lines and helped conclude the war in Munich. The 45th Infantry was known as the Thunderbird and suffered over 3,500 dead during more than 500 days of combat operations. After the war, Murray earned his degree as a pharmacist in 1948. He still works as a part-time Pharmacy Assistant at CVS. 

My District Aide, Colonel Jerry Custin, was able to present Murray with my Congressional coin and a letter of recognition for his distinguished service. WWII and Korean War Veteran O’Neal Duchame also was on hand to celebrate Murray's special day. My heartfelt thanks to Murray, O’Neal, and other members of our greatest generation for their heroic efforts to ensure peace. 
 

My team was privileged to recently help celebrate Safety Harbor VFW Post 10093 for its designation as an All-American Post. It has earned All-State recognition for the last three years, but this is its first time ever receiving All-American status. Congratulations to Post Commander John Osarczuk and the men and women of VFW Post 10092 on this prestigious achievement.
 
 

Constituent Corner

I recently received this message from the daughter of a woman my team helped access VA Widows' Benefits.

Thank you to all of you for assisting me in securing my mother's VA benefits. The Women's VA Advocate at Bay Pines in St. Petersburg did the initial hearing and had been tracking the progress of the case for quite some time. After you got involved, the case moved forward and has been resolved for my mother.  We are very grateful. 

This is just one example of the work we do each day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!

Sincerely,

CONGRESSWOMAN MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR'S WEEKLY UPDATE

Today is Marjory Stoneman Douglas Remembrance Day. We will never forget the 17 victims and their families, survivors, and first responders whose lives were forever changed by this horrific tragedy.

This week, we kicked-off our #ProsperityTour in Westchester at Maruchi's Clothing Store and continued to Cheeseburger Baby in the heart of South Beach. I'm listening very attentively to our local small business owners and fighting for them on the Small Business Committee in Congress.

I introduced an amendment that would extend the time to repay EIDL loans, related to COVID-19, from 1 year to 2 years. Our community has been devastated by the pandemic and our local job creators would have start paying these loans back in April! It is unacceptable. Our local 'mom and pop' businesses cannot start repaying the loans while they are still incurring losses from the pandemic. I'm fighting tirelessly for our community's small businesses in a bipartisan fashion to deliver immediate COVID-19 relief!

I look forward to continue addressing your cases, reading your letters, and responding to your comments on Social Media. Please continue to let me know what your thoughts are and never hesitate to reach out to my office. My team is more than happy to assist you with any of your concerns and guide you through any challenges you may have with our federal agencies. 

It is truly the honor of a lifetime to fight for YOU in the halls of Congress.

I WAS SELECTED TO SERVE ON THE FOREIGN AFFAIRS WESTERN HEMISPHERE & MIDDLE EAST SUBCOMMITTEES
￼
￼

Honored to share with you all that I was selected by my colleagues to serve on the key Western Hemisphere and Middle East Subcommittees in Congress! 

I will fight tirelessly to strengthen our economic ties with our allies and largest trading partners in Latin America, isolate the brutal socialist dictators that continue to oppress the people of Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua, and forge even stronger ties with the democratic, Jewish State of Israel.

WE KICKED-OFF OUR #PROSPERITYTOUR 
OF LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES
￼
￼

Over 80% of our local businesses employ less than 10 people and over 70% employ less than 5. Our local job creators have been the hardest-hit by COVID-19 and I'm fighting tirelessly for our small businesses in Congress!

I kicked-off our #ProsperityTour to highlight our community's local mom and pop shops and listen to their experiences throughout the pandemic. Maruchi has owned a clothing store for over 30 years in Westchester. Stephanie is the proud owner & operator of the only woman-run cheeseburger joint in our community, Cheeseburger Baby. Both have faced unprecedented challenges and it was an honor to meet with them to bring new proposals to the Small Business Committee in Congress.

I'm fighting tirelessly to deliver IMMEDIATE COVID-19 relief to our struggling small business owners.

Dear Friend,  
Happy Valentine's Day!
 
This week I had my first House Ways and Means Committee markup! A markup is a meeting of the Committee where we go through each line in a piece of legislation and ""mark"" it up before it gets voted on by the full House of Representatives. This week we marked up Democrats' expensive and partisan spending bill that includes COVID-19 relief.
 
The past COVID-19 relief packages have been negotiated on a bipartisan basis. Unfortunately, the same can't be said about this most recent package. This new legislation was written behind closed doors, includes a significant amount of liberal ""wish list"" items, and is being jammed through Congress by obscure legislative procedures. For a party that preaches unity, this is not unity from House Democrats.
 
There are still unused funds from past COVID-19 relief legislation that need to be used before we pass another piece of costly legislation. We need to target the communities that need the aid most, which is why in this week's markup I offered an amendment that would allocate emergency funds proportionately based on the number of children living in poverty in each state. It would ensure the funding in this spending bill effectively helps combat child poverty in West Virginia and across the country by targeting resources to states that need it most, not just allocating it to states with the largest populations as originally proposed in the package.
 
Sadly, every single Democrat on the Committee voted against this commonsense amendment.
 
You can watch my full markup remarks by clicking the link below.

Black History Month
 
 
Mary McLeod Bethune was born in Mayesville, SC, on July 10, 1875. Bethune was one of 17 children. Bethune was a leader in the black women's club movement and served as president of the National Association of Colored Women. She was a delegate and advisor to national conferences on education, child welfare and home ownership. She also served as director of Negro Affairs in the National Youth Administration, was a consultant to the Secretary of War, and was appointed consultant on interracial affairs and understanding at the charter conference of the National Council of Negro Women. She received the Haitian Medal of Honor and Merit, and the Commander of the Order of the Star of Africa from Liberia. Lastly, she was the first African-American woman to be involved in the White House, assisting four different presidents. Her picture hangs in the South Carolina State House and there is a statue erected to her in Washington, DC. Bethune died May 18, 1955.

I joined the Rural Broadband Caucus to support efforts to provide sufficient broadband access throughout rural communities in America. This week, I also joined 72 of my colleagues to send a bipartisan letter to President Biden urging that he include investment in rural broadband in any infrastructure proposal. Read more here.
My Ways and Means GOP Committee Colleagues and I sent a letter to the Biden Administration asking: Where are the jobs in this stimulus package? Read more here.
I recently cosponsored the Reopen Schools Act and joined 65 of his colleagues in sending a letter to President Biden urging him to follow the science and reopen schools. Read more here.
During the Ways and Means Committee Mark Up, I offered an amendment that would provide a refundable tax credit for COVID-19 testing, personal protection equipment (PPE), disinfecting, extra cleaning, and reconfiguring workspaces. It was blocked by Committee Democrats. I also offered an amendment that would encourage new investments in medical supplies, create bonus R&D incentives for infectious disease research, and help defeat the virus and rebuild the economy. But, it was blocked by Democrats.

Dear Friends,

President Joe Biden's decision to stop construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline is disastrous for American workers and puts our energy security at risk. That is why this week, I signed on to a bill to reverse President Biden’s decision and fight to protect American jobs. I also joined over 100 of my colleagues in sending a letter to President Joe Biden opposing his Executive Order banning oil and gas leasing on federal lands. This policy must be reversed as it will destroy American jobs and severely hurt our economy.

Donald Trump Acquitted Again
Yesterday's acquittal of Donald J. Trump was a victory for the Constitution and another defeat for those engaged in the permanent effort to destroy him before, during, and now, after four years of historic, successful policies that benefited the American people.

This impeachment trial never should have even taken place. It was wholly unconstitutional and somehow even more devoid of due process than the first ridiculous impeachment trial in 2020. Democrats have once again wasted our tax dollars and time on a sham impeachment because they hate Donald Trump, and to say this trial was pushed by anything other than that hate is a complete falsehood. They tried to take him down before he was sworn in as president and, along with their partners in the media and Big Tech, have now made it their top priority to do the same after he has left office.

The Left’s relentless obsession with destroying this man continues to divide our nation, but they clearly do not care. It was shameful to see such a sacred democratic process used as a political weapon, and especially to see a handful of Republican Senators and Representatives who went along with it after four years of taking credit for the accomplishments of President Trump and the conservative movement.

It is past time for Democrats to put an end to their divisive infatuation with ruining Donald Trump’s life and finally allow Congress to get back to working for the American people.
Take It Down
The barbed wire fencing surrounding the U.S. Capitol needs to come down. It’s unbelievable – Democrats will scream that the southern border wall is “immoral,” but have gladly hidden behind their own wall for more than a month.

Speaker Pelosi – TAKE IT DOWN.

Congressman McHenry Weekly Update 


We Need Targeted COVID Relief



Last week, the House Financial Services Committee held a markup of a portion of President Biden’s $1.9 trillion so-called stimulus package. We know there are sectors of our workforce still hurting—and Republicans want to provide support where it is needed—but this package goes far beyond that scope. We need to deliver temporary, targeted, and COVID-related relief to the people who need it most. Unfortunately, this package pushes partisan programs and ideas that are at the very least, unnecessary, and at the worst, harmful to the American people and the coronavirus recovery effort. Click here or on the image below to watch my opening remarks from this week's markup.

2/14/21 15:37,Senator Bennet’s Weekly Update,"A message from Senator Michael Bennet 
￼
Hello everyone,  
I hope you are taking some time over the long weekend to rest and recharge. I flew back to Denver late last night after a historic week in Washington. 
Yesterday, I joined 57 senators who voted to convict Donald Trump of impeachable offenses. Although the Senate fell short of the required two-thirds majority, our bipartisan vote reflects the powerful evidence that President Trump breached his oath of office. 
In my view, his egregious refusal to accept the results of a lawful election and his intimidation of election officials were enough to warrant conviction. In the end, President Trump stopped at nothing –– inciting a mob to attack the Capitol to overturn the lawful election of President Biden, putting American lives, principles, and democratic institutions at mortal risk. 
His conduct is a reminder that our exercise in self-government will always be vulnerable to demagogues who will do anything to hold on to power. As citizens we must stand in their way and strengthen our democracy –– today, tomorrow, and for generations to come.

This Week With Gosar
 
 
WASHINGTON D.C. - Here's what's happening...
 
 
Acquittal!
 
￼
 
Impeachment Trial:
This week, and for the second time, the Senate acquitted former President Trump, finding him innocent of the trumped-up charge brought against him earlier this year by angry, liberal Democrats in the House of Representatives. I strongly opposed this impeachment trial and voted against the ridiculous charge. The precedent that was set this week is deeply troubling and the optics for the rule of law are horrible. President Trump did not violate his oath of office and always acted to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. Furthermore, impeaching a President after he or she has left office is unconstitutional. The entire impeachment process was divisive, absurd, and illegal. Mr. Biden continues to say he wants unity, but actions speak louder than words. It is my sincere hope that Congress and the Administration turn its focus to the struggles currently facing the nation, including fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and strengthening our fragile economy.
 
 
Happy Birthday Arizona!
 
￼
 
Arizona Turns 109 Years Old:
Did you know that on Valentine’s Day, February 14th, Arizona turns 109 years old?  It’s true! The Grand Canyon state achieved its statehood on February 14, 1912. On this date 109 years ago, President Taft signed the Arizona Statehood Act, making our great state the 48th to enter the continental U.S. after spending 49 years as a U.S. territory. Arizona only had 200,000 residents at the time of statehood. Copper was discovered in 1854, and copper mining remained as Arizona’s premier industry until the 1950s. After World War II, the widespread availability of refrigeration and air conditioning gave rise to Arizona’s population boom, causing Phoenix to become one of the fastest growing cities in America. Today more than 7 million people call Arizona home. Happy Arizona Statehood Day!
 
 
 
Democrat's Frivolous COVID Spending
 
￼
 
Gosar Introduces Two Amendments To Combat Democrats Frivolous COVID Spending:
Democrats continue rushing a partisan, COVID-19 relief bill. Last week, the House Oversight and Reform Committee, which I serve on, considered portions of this nearly $2 trillion pandemic package, including provisions that would bail out certain states to the tune of another $350 billion. I am strongly opposed to allocating more money to states who stymied their economy by continuing to keep their states locked down. These lockdowns are unnecessary and have reduced state and local revenues.  Instead of bailing out liberal states, it’s time for these states to open back up.  Unfortunately, Democrats have hijacked the COVID-19 relief bill in order to give special treatment to liberal states and allocate spending for many things completed unrelated to COVID-19 relief. For these reasons, I introduced an amendment that ensures any misuse of COVID funds (such as paying down state pension funds) is punishable by 20 years in prison and a hefty fine, and another amendment that  eliminates special treatment for Washington D.C. by requiring it comply with the same rules are everyone else.
 
 
Follow the Science, Reopen Schools
 
￼
 GOP Doc Caucus Letter to Biden:
Last week, the nation’s top health agency, the Center for Disease Control (CDC), announced what we all have known the be true: there is strong evidence that in-person classroom are safe and schools across our nation should reopen. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, it was thought best that in-classroom schools be closed for the safety of our students and teachers. Unfortunately, many schools remain closed today, despite CDC guidelines advising otherwise. Our students are missing out on key socialization, education, and nutritional health services that open schools provide. One tragic side-effect resulting from these closures has been an increase in mental health emergency visit. When it comes to reopening schools, Mr. Biden and Democrats profess to be following science. But here are the facts. In January, the CDC recommended sending children back to school, and Mr. Biden’s top COVID-19 advisor, Dr. Anthony Fauci echoed these calls. The CDC has even said it is safe for teachers to return to the classroom even while vaccinations are ongoing. To aid this transition back to schools, Congress allocated $82 billion in December. Clearly, both the science and resources are present to revamp our educational system, therefore this week myself and my fellow members of the Doctors Caucus penned a letter to President Biden, urging him to follow the science and to work with governors to return our children to school in a safe and reasonable way.
 
 
 
We Must Steer Clear of the Iran Nuclear Deal
 
￼
 
A Bad Deal is a Bad Deal:
This week, Iran made headlines again over its continued pursuit of nuclear weapons. It was uncovered that Iran is producing uranium metal, which is critical for the development of nuclear weapons. The Iranian regime will stop at nothing to create nuclear weapons. For many reasons, the Iran Nuclear Deal was a terrible agreement and I am grateful that President Trump withdrew from it. Specifically, the agreement sunsets in 2030. Thereafter, Iran will be able to create weapons without any repercussions. It also does not allow the International Atomic Energy Agency the ability to conduct random inspections in Iran, allowing the terrorist nation time to hide all nuclear developments from the world. This week’s news reaffirms my position that the Iran nuclear deal is dangerous for America and the world, and therefore this week, myself and my Republican colleagues sent a letter to President Biden imploring him to not rejoin the Iran Nuclear Deal. 
 
 
 
Protecting Your Second Amendment Rights
 
￼
 
Protecting Your Second Amendment Rights:
Joe Biden is carrying a full-out assault on your constitutional right to bear arms – and I don’t support him.  Specifically, Mr. Biden wants to limit the number of guns you can own and is threatening to hold gun manufacturers liable for crimes committed using guns. I am convinced Biden’s ultimate goal is to ban citizens from owning firearms altogether.
 
As a gun owner myself, I believe Arizonans and all Americans have a right to protect themselves.  That right is being threatened like never before. 
 
I recently fought to prevent the Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms from banning pistol braces.  I am also an original co-sponsor of legislation that allows citizens the right to carry a firearm on Army Corps of Engineer properties. These are just some of the recent actions I have taken, and you can be assured that I will continue to fight to protect your Second Amendment rights.

Andy Biggs’ Fund and Complete the Border Wall Act (H.R. 58) & Voter Integrity Protection Act (H.R. 37), and signing onto Rep. Jason Smith's letter urging President Joe Biden to reopen schools and businesses. 

Personalized Care Act (H.R. 725):
	•	The Personalized Care Act works to allow individuals to control their healthcare by cutting down on bureaucracy and giving families more choices through more freedom. 
	•	The ""Personalized Care Act"" expands what Healthcare Savings Accounts (HSAs) can pay for: Including individuals who are part of a short-term duration plan, medical indemnity plan, or a group health plan. Government plans, including Medicare parts A & B or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) Quadrupling the amount people can contribute to an HSA. 
	•	Allows health insurance premiums, periodic fees for medical care and provider services to be paid for using an HSA. Allows over the counter medicines or drugs to be paid for. Lowers the penalties from non-qualified distributions from 20 percent to 10 percent.”

	•	Establishes funding for a U.S.-Mexico border barrier and revises how border patrol agents are compensated for overtime.

 Voter Integrity Protection Act (H.R. 37): 
	•	This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to make voting in a federal election (unless otherwise provided for under the federal criminal code) by an alien who is unlawfully in the United States an aggravated felony and a deportable offense.

Letter urging President Joe Biden to Reopen Schools:

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene announced her support of these America First Policies: 

“I didn’t come to Washington D.C. sit on the sidelines. I came to Washington D.C. to continue President Trump's America First agenda and deliver for Northwest Georgia. This week I backed strong conservative legislation that does just that.”

￼ 
Dear Friends,

During the month of February, we celebrate the birthdays of Presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln and observe Presidents’ Day to honor all who served in our nation’s highest office. This year, it feels especially important to reflect on the legacies and lessons of our past presidents. 

As our nation continues to recover from COVID-19 and grapple with the aftermath of the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol, we should remember that our nation has stood the test of time through other periods of division and hardship thanks to the leadership of American presidents. 

May we remember the words of President Lincoln’s famous second inaugural address: “With malice toward none; with charity for all … let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds…”

As we pause tomorrow to observe Presidents' Day, I hope all Arkansans and Americans will remember the lessons of the presidents who have gone before us and strive toward a more perfect union.

GETTING YOUR COVID-19 VACCINE 
Arkansas is currently receiving about 40,000 vaccine doses per week, approximately a 23% increase since mid-January. While demand remains high, I am proud that Arkansas has one of the highest per capita vaccination rates in the nation. I encourage all Arkansans to get the vaccine when they are eligible.   
On Friday, approximately 58 Walmart locations across the state began receiving 10,000 vaccine doses per week directly from the federal government. Vaccines will also be available soon at federally approved community health centers (CHCs).  
You can go online to find an approved pharmacy near you or sign up for an appointment at Baptist Health and UAMS.  Please contact my office if you have questions or concerns about vaccine distribution.   
On Thursday, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced that VA health facilities would receive a one-time supplemental allocation of 200,000 Moderna COVID-19 vaccine doses from the Department of Health and Human Services. This distribution is in addition to the VA’s normally scheduled delivery of approximately 125,000 doses of both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines each week.  
Currently, VA is offering the COVID-19 vaccine to Veterans already receiving care from the VA, based on CDC and VA risk criteria. If you're eligible to get a vaccine, your VA health care team will contact you.
Veterans who are not enrolled or do not currently receive care at the VA can visit the VA's Eligibility web page to learn more: Eligibility For VA Health Care | Veterans Affairs
I am continuing to monitor the vaccine distribution process and will keep Arkansans updated as I learn more information. 

SERVING ARKANSAS VETERANS 
My staff and I have been busy working on behalf of the more than 50,000 veterans who live in central Arkansas. I am committed to ensuring that those who have served our nation receive the highest quality of care and benefits. If there is anything I can do to help, please do not hesitate to reach out. Contact my District Office at (501) 324-5941.
On Wednesday, my Veterans Team hosted our first mobile office hours of 2021 at St. Francis House in Little Rock to assist veterans with TRICARE, medals, VA health, widow benefits, pensions, disabilities, and other critical issues. If you are a veteran or know of a veteran who could not attend, please contact our District Representatives for Military and Veterans Affairs. 
Veterans in Pulaski County are invited to join me on February 17th at 2:00 PM CT for a virtual meeting of my Veterans Advisory Council. This is the first of 2021, and we will have a lot to talk about.
If you would like to attend, please call my office to RSVP or send me an email at Hill.House.Gov/Contact. 
￼

I am proud of my Veterans Team for their dedicated efforts to include Arkansas veterans in the Library of Congress’ Veterans History Project.
Back in December, they interviewed U.S. Army Specialist Michael Springer to discuss his time serving in our military and record his memories for future generations.
SPC Springer served from January 29, 2002 – November 5, 2005, during Operation Iraqi Freedom in Baghdad, Iraq.
If you are a veteran and you would like to participate in the Veteran History Project, contact my District Representative, Dlayne Tucciarone, at (501) 324-5941.

KEEPING FAMILIES HEALTHY AND SAFE
During the ongoing pandemic, many Americans remain uninsured or underinsured and still need affordable health coverage. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has determined that COVID-19 presents exceptional circumstances for consumers in accessing health insurance and will provide a Special Enrollment Period (SEP) for individuals and families to apply and enroll if they need coverage. Starting on February 15, 2021, and continuing through May 15, 2021, eligible Arkansans can apply for new coverage or update an existing application through the HealthCare.gov platform. 
For more information, visit the HealthCare.gov website or call my office at (501) 324-5941.  

CALLING ON PRESIDENT BIDEN TO HOLD CHINA ACCOUNTABLE 
For three decades, China has not played by the rules. 
President Biden should not return to the status quo of hoping for reform from the Chinese Communist Party when that approach has not worked in the past. It did not protect our intellectual property rights, it did not create fair markets and trade with China, and it did not force China to honor the territorial rights of other countries and the human rights of its own citizens. 
Democrats in Congress are calling on the International Monetary Fund to give China $170 billion. Having the IMF issue special drawing rights (SDRs) to all member countries would do more harm than good because the relief is not targeted, and it will not help developing countries struggling during the pandemic. 
On Monday, I joined Maria Bartiromo on Fox Business to discuss my op-ed in The Wall Street Journal about how House Democrats and Senate Democrats plan to bail out China and how House Republicans will hold President Biden accountable for his China policy. 

￼

SAVE THE DATE: VETERANS JOB FAIR AND OUTREACH
On April 7, 2021, I am hosting a job fair for central Arkansas veterans. If you’re a veteran who has recently begun the transition to civilian life or lost your job due to COVID-19, I invite you to attend this job fair. Col. Nate Todd, Arkansas Secretary of Veterans Affairs, will be in attendance to answer your questions and hear your concerns. 
To RSVP, please call my District Office at (501) 324-5941 or email me at Hill.House.Gov/Contact.

Rob’s Rundown: Week of February 8 – February 13, 2021  
Senator Portman was in Washington this week as the Senate convened for the impeachment trial of former President Trump. His statement on the conclusion of the trial can be found here.  
On Tuesday, Portman delivered opening remarks at the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on the nomination of Neera Tanden to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) calling for the administration to work in a bipartisan manner to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, growing cybersecurity threats as demonstrated by the SolarWinds attack, and continuing the bipartisan work on federal permitting and regulatory processes. Portman secured commitments from Ms. Tanden that she would support his bipartisan Buy American Act, prioritize cybersecurity in the wake of the SolarWinds cyberattack, and also support the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council created through Portman’s FAST-41 legislation.
Also on Tuesday, Portman announced that he has officially been named the Ranking Member on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee for the 117th Congress. 
On Thursday Portman participated in a virtual event hosted by The Hill examining the impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on the opioid epidemic in the United States. Portman provided detailed analysis of the addiction crisis, discussed legislative efforts to address it, and touted his Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) 2.0 legislation as a needed next step in the fight against this nationwide epidemic. 
Finally, Portman issued a statement Wednesday calling on the Biden Administration to reconsider its decision to withdraw a rule proposed by the Trump Administration to require American schools and universities to disclose partnerships with Confucius Institutes and Classrooms.  
For a more detailed look at Senator Portman’s week, please see the following: 
Monday, February 8, 2021 
Portman, Cardin Lead Bipartisan Bill to Make Work Opportunity Tax Credit Permanent 
Senator Portman, Ben Cardin (D-MD), Roy Blunt (R-MO), Sherrod Brown (D-OH), Bill Cassidy (R-LA), and Bob Menendez (D-NJ) introduced bipartisan legislation – the Work Opportunity Tax Credit & Jobs Act – to make permanent the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC), which encourages employers to hire individuals who face significant barriers to employment.  Currently, the WOTC expires on December 31, 2025.   
The WOTC provides an employer tax credit of between $1,200 and $9,600 per employee for hiring and retaining individuals that are part of certain targeted groups representing populations that have a difficult time finding work, or are often out of the labor force altogether. The credit amount is based on the qualified wages paid to those employees within the targeted groups. These targeted groups include: veterans, long-term unemployed, ex-felons, the disabled, summer youth employees, as well as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and Supplemental Security Income recipients. 
""Because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, now more than ever individuals who are in the shadows are struggling to find meaningful employment,” said Senator Portman. ""Encouraging employers to hire those who have the most trouble finding work is good policy, and while securing a five-year extension last year was a positive step, it’s critical that we make the Work Opportunity Tax Credit permanent.""  
Bipartisan Senate Homeland Security, Rules, Judiciary, Intelligence, Appropriations and Armed Services Committee Leaders Press Security Agencies for Information Related to Capitol Attack 
Senators Portman and Gary Peters (D-MI), leaders of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee; Roy Blunt (R-MO) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), leaders of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration; Chuck Grassley (R-IA) and Dick Durbin (D-IL), leaders of the Judiciary Committee; Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Mark Warner (D-VA), leaders of the Select Committee on Intelligence; Richard Shelby (R-AL) and Patrick Leahy (D-VT), leaders of the Appropriations Committee; and Jim Inhofe (R-OK) and Jack Reed (D-RI), leaders of the Armed Services Committee, are pressing key law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies to provide them with all relevant information related to the January 6, 2021, attack on the United States Capitol. The bipartisan information requests follow an announcement from the leaders of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and Rules Committees to conduct joint oversight of the security failures that led to the breach of the Capitol building.  
""The January 6, 2021 attack on our Capitol, one of the great symbols of American democracy, will forever be a stain on our Nation’s history.  The attackers failed to disrupt the work of Congress, due in large part to the heroic acts of many officers and congressional staff.  Nevertheless, the security failures that led to the breach endangered not just the Vice President and the Congress, but the peaceful, democratic transfer of power itself.  The American people deserve a complete accounting of those failures,"" wrote the senators. 
The senators are requesting information from 22 agencies and departments related to the preparations for and response to the January 6, 2021 Joint Session of Congress and the security failures that led to a breach of the Capitol. The senators are seeking information on intelligence gathering on potential violence prior to the attack, security preparations, and detailed explanations of the agency’s security response. 
The following is a full list of the agencies the senators are seeking information from: Senate Sergeant at Arms, House of Representatives Sergeant at Arms, United States Capitol Police, Architect of the Capitol, District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department, District of Columbia Executive Office of the Mayor, District of Columbia Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency, Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Bureau of Prisons, United States Park Police, United States Marshals Service, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Department of Homeland Security, United States Secret Service, Federal Protective Service, Customs and Border Protection, Department of Homeland Security Office of Intelligence and Analysis, Department of Defense, National Guard Bureau, United States Army and Department of the Interior.

At HSGAC Hearing on Tanden Nomination, Portman Calls on Biden Administration to Work with Congress in Bipartisan Manner 
Portman delivered opening remarks at the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on the nomination of Neera Tanden to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) calling for the administration to work in a bipartisan manner to address the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, growing cybersecurity threats as demonstrated by the SolarWinds attack, and continuing the bipartisan work on federal permitting and regulatory processes. As a former OMB Director under President George W. Bush, Senator Portman understands the importance of the role and the importance of working productively both within the administration and across the agencies, but also with members of Congress, on a bipartisan basis.
A transcript of Senator Portman’s opening statement can be found here and a video can be found here. 
Portman Named Top Republican on Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  
Portman announced that he has been named the Ranking Member on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. He released the following statement: 
""I look forward to serving as Ranking Member on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and working with Chairman Peters to perform bipartisan oversight of our federal agencies and craft legislation to protect Ohio and our country from growing threats. I plan to prioritize cybersecurity as we continue oversight of the SolarWinds breach, and will continue working in a bipartisan manner on the investigation into the security failings at the U.S. Capitol on January 6th in a fair, thorough, and expeditious manner along with the other committees of jurisdiction – the Rules Committee, Appropriations Committee, Intelligence Committee, Armed Services Committee, and the Judiciary Committee – so that such a tragedy does not happen again. I will also work with my colleagues to ensure transparency in the ongoing COVID-19 relief efforts and on-shoring production of necessary supplies, continue to address the ongoing addiction epidemic, safeguard communities from the scourge of human trafficking, and hold foreign actors accountable for their actions that threaten our national security."" 
At HSGAC Hearing, Portman Secures Commitment from OMB Nominee Neera Tanden to Prioritize Cybersecurity & Federal Permitting Processes and Protect the Buy American Act 
During today’s Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing on the nomination of Neera Tanden to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Portman secured a commitment from Ms. Tanden that she would support Portman’s bipartisan Buy American Act, prioritize cybersecurity in the wake of the SolarWinds cyberattack, and also support the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council created through Portman’s FAST-41 legislation. Portman highlighted the importance of making his FAST-41 legislation permanent. In 2015, Portman sponsored the Federal Permitting Improvement Act, which Congress ultimately enacted into law as Title 41 of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act. That bill, now known as FAST-41, significantly reformed the federal infrastructure permitting process while leaving environmental protections in place, and created the Permitting Council. Currently, FAST-41 will expire in 2022.  Senator Portman, however, has introduced legislation, the Federal Permitting Reform and Jobs Act, to lift the sunset on FAST-41, which will ensure that the Permitting Council can continue its work to make the infrastructure permitting process more efficient and reduce unnecessary delays. A more efficient permitting process supports the creation of new jobs, which will help the nation recover from the COVID-19 crisis.
In addition, Senator Portman also questioned Ms. Tanden about the partisan public statements she has made in the past. As a former OMB Director under President George W. Bush, Senator Portman understands the importance of being able to work productively both within the administration and across the federal agencies, but also with members of Congress, on a bipartisan basis.
In addition, Portman Excerpts of the hearing can be found here and videos can be found here and here. 
Portman Joins Johnson & 19 Colleagues in Raising Alarm Over Biden Revoking Transparency Measures 
Portman joined Senator Ron Johnson (R-WI) and 19 of their colleagues in sending a letter to President Joe Biden questioning why he revoked an executive order requiring federal agencies to post guidance documents in a searchable database. The searchable database of federal agencies’ guidance documents, which explain how an agency will interpret and apply its regulations, provides transparency and ensures that Americans affected by federal agency guidance are aware of what guidance documents are so they can more easily comply with them. The executive order was modeled after bipartisan legislation, the Guidance Out Of Darkness Act (GOOD Act) that was approved by voice vote by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs each of the last two sessions of Congress.  
Senators James Lankford (R-OK), Rand Paul (R-KY), Joni Ernst (R-IA), John Cornyn (R-TX), Thom Tillis (R-NC), Kevin Cramer (R-ND), Ted Cruz (R-TX), Dan Sullivan (R-AK), John Barrasso (R-WY), Pat Toomey (R-PA), James Risch (R-ID), Mike Lee (R-UT), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Rick Scott (R-FL), Bill Hagerty (R-TN), Deb Fischer (R-NE), Mike Braun (R-IN), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), and Roger Marshall (R-KS) joined Portman and Johnson in sending the letter.  
""Your revocation of Executive Order 13891 is also contrary to sound policy,” the senators wrote. “The purpose of the executive order and the GOOD Act is to promote transparency and ensure that Americans affected by Federal agency guidance know what those guidance documents are so they can more easily comply with them. This policy addresses real problems with the growing administrative state that affect both everyday Americans and other regulated entities, like states and local governments. It is only fair that people, businesses and local governments know what is required of them.""  
Full text of the letter can be found here. 
Portman Applauds Service of David DeVillers, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio 
Portman issued the following statement on the service of David DeVillers as the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Ohio has three office locations in Columbus, Cincinnati, and Dayton, and handles federal cases that arise in the 48 southern counties in Ohio. Portman praised the confirmation of David DeVillers for the position of U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of Ohio in 2019.    
""I want to thank U.S. Attorney David DeVillers for his outstanding service to Southern District of Ohio and the U.S. Department of Justice. I was proud to recommend him for his role as U.S. Attorney and was grateful for his support and partnership throughout his tenure. Under David’s leadership, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Ohio has led the charge on tackling public corruption, combatting human trafficking, and stopping violent crime in our communities. David is a no-nonsense public servant and I wish him all the best in his future endeavors."" 
Wednesday, February 10, 2021 
Portman Statement on the Constitutionality of the Senate’s Impeachment Trial 
Portman issued the following statement after yesterday’s vote on the Constitutionality of the Senate’s impeachment trial: 
""There is no question in my mind that former President Trump bears some responsibility for the tragic events of January 6, through his words and actions. I have called his comments that day inexcusable. I’ve also consistently said that I believe there are serious constitutional questions surrounding holding a Senate trial with the intent of convicting of a former president. The text of the Constitution prescribes removal from office as the punishment upon conviction, and former federal officials by definition are no longer in office.  
""Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution says: ‘The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.’ This text, in my view, makes clear that the framers reserved the tool of impeachment for removal of current presidents, not private citizens. A president who is no longer in public office cannot be removed from office, regardless of how inappropriate we may deem their conduct.  That’s why I voted that the Senate does not have jurisdiction. The more appropriate place to hold private citizens accountable would be the criminal justice system."" 
Portman, Peters Reintroduce Bipartisan Bill to Improve Transparency of Federal Spending 
Senators Rob Portman and Gary Peters (D-MI), Ranking Member and Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, announced that they have reintroduced a bipartisan bill to help make information about how the federal government is spending taxpayer dollars more accessible to the public. The legislation will improve government transparency by requiring federal agencies to publish easily understandable justifications for their budget requests on a single, central website each year. Congressional budget justifications are plain-language explanations of how agencies propose to spend money that they request from Congressional appropriators. The materials would also be posted on each agency’s website. The bill was unanimously approved by the committee and passed by the House last Congress. 
""Ohioans and all Americans should be able to easily evaluate how the federal government is spending their hard-earned tax dollars,"" said Senator Portman. ""This bipartisan legislation will improve federal government transparency by requiring federal agencies to publish their annual budget justifications on a centralized website. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation to ensure the transparency Americans deserve on government spending."" 
Portman Urges Biden Administration to Reconsider Decision to Withdraw Rule Protecting American Students from Chinese Influence Operations 
Portman urged the Biden Administration to reconsider its decision to withdraw a rule proposed by the Trump Administration to require American schools and universities to disclose partnerships with Confucius Institutes and Classrooms. In February 2019, Portman, as Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), released a bipartisan report detailing the lack of transparency in how American colleges and universities manage Confucius Institutes—which are located at more than 100 American colleges and universities and have received more than $150 million in support from the Chinese government. These Confucius Institutes are controlled, funded, and mostly staffed by the Chinese government. Portman released the following statement: 
""The Biden Administration’s decision to withdraw this rule is deeply disappointing and surprising considering the serious nature of China’s efforts to expand its influence operations inside the United States.  I urge them to reconsider. As the bipartisan report which I co-authored in 2019 documents, there is a stunning lack of transparency about how Confucius Institutes operate inside the United States. We learned that schools in the United States—from kindergarten to college—have provided a level of access to the Chinese government that can stifle academic freedom and provide Confucius Institute students with an incomplete, and sometimes inaccurate, picture of Chinese history, government actions, and policies that run counter to U.S. interests at home and abroad. Our PSI reported documented how China and the Chinese Communist Party provides no reciprocity and has systematically shut down key U.S. State Department public diplomacy efforts on Chinese college campuses.  Absent full transparency regarding how and where Confucius Institutes operate, Confucius Institutes should not operate in the United States and be allowed to influence American students."" 
Saturday, February 13, 2021 
Portman Statement on Senate Impeachment Trial 
Portman issued the following statement on the conclusion of the Senate impeachment trial: 
""The siege of the U.S. Capitol on January 6 was an attack on democracy itself. That night, shortly after the rioters had been cleared from the Senate floor, I spoke to urge my colleagues to support the state certifications of the election results as our constitutional duty, and as a signal that ‘we will not be intimidated’ and that ‘mob rule is not going to prevail here.' 
""I have said that what President Trump did that day was inexcusable because in his speech he encouraged the mob, and that he bears some responsibility for the tragic violence that occurred. I have also criticized his slow response as the mob stormed the U.S. Capitol, putting at risk the safety of Vice President Pence, law enforcement officers, and others who work in the Capitol. Even after the attack, some of the language in his tweets and in a video showed sympathy for the violent mob. In response, I called on President Trump to ‘explicitly urge his supporters to remain peaceful and refrain from violence.' 
""But the question I must answer is not whether President Trump said and did things that were reckless and encouraged the mob. I believe that happened. The threshold question I must answer is whether a former president can be convicted by the Senate in the context of an impeachment. This would be unprecedented.  Consistent with the two votes I have already taken in this process, I believe the Constitution reserves the narrow tool of impeachment and conviction for removal of current officeholders and current presidents, and does not apply to former officeholders or former presidents. Impeachment in the Constitution is fundamentally about removing someone from office. 
""I think the Framers of the Constitution understood that it would be inappropriate to allow Congress – an inherently political body – to convict former presidents.  Instead, the appropriate place to address former officials’ conduct is the criminal justice system. In fact, the Constitution makes clear that former presidents are subject to the criminal justice system.  That is where the issues raised by the president’s inexcusable actions and words must be addressed.  
""I have a duty to uphold my oath to the Constitution and that’s why I voted as I did, on the state certifications of the election on January 6, on the jurisdictional issue earlier this week, and on the final vote on conviction today. My decision today in no way condones the president’s conduct. On the contrary, it is keeping an oath to the Constitution, that I believe the president did not keep on January 6.  
""Our country is already deeply divided. My decision was based on my reading of the Constitution, but I believe the Framers understood that convicting a former president and disqualifying him or her from running again pulls people further apart. Instead, our task should be to help bridge the growing gaps that separate us.  President Biden said in his inaugural address, ‘This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward.’  I agree, and will continue to do my part to try to find that common ground to bring our country together to address the many challenges we face.""

Government floods $1M into Old North Dayton investment 
The federal government is funneling over $1 million into the Miami Valley to further protect Dayton businesses from future threats of flooding.
The U.S. Department of Commerce will invest $1.1 million through its Economic Development Administration to upgrade the Greater Old North Dayton levee, according to a release. 
The grant will be coupled with a $276,000 local investment. The EDA says the investment will retain 100 jobs and generate $5 million in private investment. 
""Supporting community-led disaster resilience efforts is a top priority for the Economic Development Administration,” said Dennis Alvord, acting assistant secretary of commerce for economic development. “This EDA investment will reduce flood risk from the Great Miami River for businesses, homes, and infrastructure and ensure long-term economic benefits to the Miami Valley Region.""
U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-OH) says the investment will include an upgrade of the deteriorated concrete that armors the Greater Old North Dayton levee. 
""In doing so, lives, properties, jobs, and businesses will be safeguarded and protected,” Portman said in a release.
The EDA-funded improvements include re-armoring the levee with concrete and utilizing the levee as a new alternative transportation route for the region’s commuters. The project will ensure that more than 700 local businesses have adequate levee protection from future disaster events, providing the region’s employers with the protection and confidence that they need to compete and grow, according to the release.

Biden faces mounting GOP backlash after withdrawing Trump rule on Confucius Institutes 
The Biden administration is facing growing backlash from Republicans after it withdrew a rule aimed at imposing reporting requirements on educational institutions that harbor Confucius Institutes — Chinese government-connected organizations that are ostensibly cultural centers but have drawn widespread concern that they are spreading pro-China propaganda. 
Immigration Customs and Enforcement confirmed to Fox News that the rule ‒ first reported by Axios as a last-minute effort by the Trump administration ‒ was withdrawn on Jan. 26. The rule would have required schools to report whether they have relationships with Confucius Institutes. 
""Confucius Institutes are front groups for the Chinese Communist Party on American campuses,” Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., said of the rule’s withdrawal. “The federal government ought to shut down these regime-run institutes or, at a minimum, require colleges to disclose their secret agreements with them. Instead, the Biden administration is allowing a foreign influence operation to continue in the shadows.""
""The Biden Administration’s decision to withdraw this rule is deeply disappointing and surprising considering the serious nature of China’s efforts to expand its influence operations inside the United States,” Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said in a statement. “I urge them to reconsider."" 
Among the findings Portman pointed to from a 2019 Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations Report: “Since 2006, the Chinese government has provided more than $158 million to more than 100 U.S. schools for Confucius Institutes.""
Added Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.: “@FBI has warned about #China’s Communist Party using #ConfuciusInstitute to infiltrate American schools[.] But now Biden quietly withdrawn rule proposed by Trump admin to require schools & universities to disclose their partnerships with these agents of Chinese govt influence.""
Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., introduced a budget amendment in the House Education and Labor Committee that would have blocked schools with Confucius Institutes from getting federal funds. It was blocked by Democrats.  
""We must prevent American taxpayer dollars from going to institutions that have partnerships with any entity owned, controlled, or organized under the laws of the Chinese Communist Party, which we know is censoring free speech, engaging in genocide in Xinjiang Province, and influencing American academia before our eyes,” Stefanik said. 
Voice of America (VOA) reported that the White House emphasized the rule was not withdrawn from the Federal Register but from the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs process. The White House said, according to VOA, that the withdrawal happened because of a widespread regulatory freeze instituted by the Biden administration on Inauguration Day. 
Nevertheless, Republicans have raised alarm over the fact that the Biden administration’s actions halted the rule aimed at limiting Chinese government influence on American campuses.  
""Yesterday, Biden admin reversed a rule that stopped #CCP from sharing propaganda on US campuses,” Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., said. “@RepStefanik fought back & offered an amendment during markup last night to stop the reversal. Democrats struck it down."" 
Other Western countries have also raised alarm about Confucius Institutes. Sweden last year became the first European country to purge all Confucius Institutes from its country, The Times reported. That happened amid deteriorating relations between the two countries and persistent efforts by China to gain more influence in the Arctic. 
Republicans have long been opposed to supporting Confucius Institutes, and their recent opposition to the institutes came even before news broke that the Biden administration withdrew the Trump-era rule.  
""Confucius Institutes are merely a tool for the Chinese Communist Party to spread propaganda to our youth and they have no place in Utah schools or our country,” Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said last week in response to efforts to close the institutes in his state. “Applaud efforts in the Utah Legislature to remove these institutes from our state universities.”

Dear Friend,

Nearly a month after Joe Biden promised unity, the division in our country has only grown deeper thanks to the partisan actions of Washington Democrats. They are bending the rules to push a massive bailout package through Congress while at the same time trying to impeach a President who has already left office.

So far this impeachment trial has played out like a re-run of a bad sitcom. The plot is known, the outcome is guaranteed, and the emotions are forced with bad acting...KEEP READING HERE

WHAT'S GREAT IN THE 8TH 


￼

Missouri now has an online portal, the COVID-19 Vaccine Navigator, to help residents find vaccination locations and schedule an appointment. You can also find eligibility requirements, cost descriptions, and data about the vaccine.

￼

Chef Kelcie Miller has had culinary adventures around the world but, luckily for us, brought back her wealth of knowledge and talent home to Cape Girardeau. Her newly opened La Relance Cuisine is a labor of love that offers catering, meal prep services, and cooking classes for the community.

￼

The Love Out Loud youth group in Irondale worked for many hours on homemade chocolate covered strawberries for their most recent fundraiser. The proceeds from this fundraiser will go to benefit local veterans, a gift from our thoughtful youth to our treasured patriots.

￼

The Cape Girardeau County Sheriff's Office is helping deliver prescription medications for senior citizens who cannot retrieve their own during these harsh winter weather conditions. Thank you to every officer participating in this program and dedicating their time to ensuring the well-being of our friends and neighbors.

￼

Students who participated in Wyman’s Teen Outreach Program (TOP) at Central Middle School delivered their hand-made toys and treats for animals in local animal shelters. Throughout the school year, students in TOP complete 20+ hours of volunteer community service on projects of their choice and design.



 IN CASE YOU MISSED IT

￼

This week I joined Julie Mason on SiriusXM's POTUS radio channel to discuss my opposition to Biden's bail-out bill. Only 9% of the $1.9 trillion dollars would be used to stop the COVID-19 virus while the other trillions reward Biden's friends: failing blue states and big tech.

￼

I led 66 of my colleagues in writing Joe Biden's White House to tell them to follow science and open schools nationwide. There is little evidence to show in-person instruction in classrooms contributes to the spread of COVID-19. Our children are suffering, and it is time to allow them to resume their education with in-person lessons.

￼

I had the pleasure of joining Carrie Sheffield on Just the News to discuss Washington Democrats proving they are ""all hat and no cattle"" with their circus of an impeachment trial. Their continued refusal to work with their colleagues across the aisle to serve the American people is a disservice to those who voted for action rather than tantrums.

￼

This week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce chose to endorse Biden's Office of Management and Budget director nominee, Neera Tanden, who has spent her entire career taking big business money while pushing policies that destroy small business jobs. By endorsing Tanden, the Chamber is proving it cares more about protecting multinational, Wall Street-backed corporations than Main Street businesses.

￼

I offered two bipartisan amendments to the nearly $2 trillion ""stimulus"" package to make sure the money is used to benefit those who need it most. One would help families who have struggled to afford the costs of remote learning by allowing them to use their 529 savings accounts to buy books, tutoring expenses, and educational therapy for students with disabilities. The second would make the Child Tax Credit, that I voted to double in 2017, permanent for American families. Pelosi's Democrats rejected these improvements and 200 others which would have actually helped American families and instead Washington Dems are prioritizing spending Missourians tax dollars on bailouts for states that continue to enact lock downs, small business and school closures.

Friends,   It was an historic week. 
 

￼
ONE: Holding Former President Donald Trump Accountable
As a member of the U.S. Senate, it was my constitutional duty to sit as a juror in the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump for inciting the violent insurrectionist attack on our democracy that took the lives of five individuals, including New Jersey native son, Officer Brian Sicknick. Not only were all 100 members of the Senate jurors, each of us was a witness to the insurrection. Read my statement about why I voted to convict the President. 
 
￼
TWO: Getting Help to the American People
Democrats made sure that last week’s impeachment trial did not slow down our efforts to pass President Biden’s American Rescue Plan to end this pandemic and relieve the economic suffering across our country. I am working with my colleagues in the House and Senate to finalize this legislation quickly so that we can speed vaccination distribution, provide a lifeline to small businesses and struggling families, help schools reopen safely, and save the jobs of teachers, police officers, firefighters, and other frontline workers. And as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, I’m also working to prevent new strains of COVID-19 from spreading abroad and reaching our shores. Here’s what I said earlier this week:

THREE: Securing the Vaccines America Needs
The Trump Administration said 20 million Americans would be vaccinated by December 2020 but by year’s end only about two million people got their shots. That’s why I’m pleased to see President Biden quickly take the kind of aggressive action we need to speed up vaccination distribution and protect more Americans from this deadly virus. This week, the President announced his administration has secured 200 million more doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines – combined with previous purchases, this is enough for every American to get vaccinated. Read more about it here. 
 
Also!
From Harlem Renaissance writer Jessie Redmon Fauset, to actor and civil rights icon Paul Robeson, and of course our social and racial justice warrior Senator Cory Booker, New Jersey has been the home of prominent and influential Black leaders dedicated to bringing change to our nation.

Dear Friends,  
Tax filing season began on the 12th. As I mentioned in last week's update, Ohioans should file electronically, if possible, as the IRS is still working through a backlog of paper returns filed last year. It's also important to keep your eyes out for signs of tax fraud, particularly regarding unemployment insurance benefits. If you receive a 1099-G tax form from the state for benefits that you did not apply for, you may be the victim of identity theft and can file a report here. The IRS has provided information to help protect yourself from identity theft and unemployment insurance fraud, which you can view here.
 
I am actively working with the State of Ohio and the IRS to help Americans who may find themselves the victim of unemployment insurance fraud. Read more about the four actions I am requesting the IRS take to help taxpayers.
 
This past week, House committees met to consider portions of the forthcoming COVID-19 relief package. In the Ways & Means Committee, Democrats rejected amendments that would have helped get Americans back to work, protect against fraud, and assist parents. Unlike the four previous relief bills that were done in a bipartisan fashion, this bill is being pushed through by one party. I joined Neil Cavuto to discuss the proposal and the process on Friday. You can watch my interview here.
 
On the vaccine front, Ohioans 65 years of age or older, employees of K-12 schools that will remain or return to in-person learning, and individuals with severe congenital or development disorders are eligible to receive the vaccine, per state guidance. You can find more information here.
 
In your service,
Brad

2/14/21 21:59,Weekly Wrap Up,"
￼ 
Dear Neighbor,  I hope this email finds you safe and warm.  Of course, the arctic blast reaching our district tonight is on everyone’s minds.  We are just beginning a challenging few days for our region. Many roads are already closed and unfortunately, there are already accidents from ice on the roads.  So, please stay safe and follow guidance from our local officials.  I’ve been following the weather as well as the events in Washington, and I am glad to send you a summary of news from this week.  It was a busy week, and there is much to report.  Of course, yesterday, the Senate voted to acquit former President Trump against the Article of Impeachment for inciting violence against our democracy.  The second impeachment trial against former President Trump has been one of the most important and somber responsibilities of this Congress.  It is a responsibility I take seriously, and I did when I co-sponsored and voted in favor of the Article of Impeachment.   Throughout the trial this past week, House impeachment managers presented a clear and compelling case to the Senate, laying out the overwhelming and undisputed evidence that that former President Trump incited an insurrection against the government of the United States resulting in an unprecedented attack on the symbolic and functional heart of our democracy, our Capitol.  And, once he had, President Trump failed to defend the Capitol or the government as the attack took place.  There is no greater violation of the Presidential oath to “preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States.”  As you know, I was present in the Capitol that day, in the House Gallery, and I saw firsthand the real threat to our country.  I followed the evidence of this week’s trial to see the presentation of the events as they unfolded, including my own evacuation from the Gallery.  The House impeachment managers showed the very physical danger we faced on January 6 as well as the ongoing danger that our country faces and the danger of not holding the former President—or any future President—accountable for actions against our country.  As I told you almost immediately after the events of January 6, I supported addressing the insurrection with the seriousness and immediacy it deserved, including co-sponsoring the Article of Impeachment we passed in the House on January 13.  Many of you agreed, and many of you called or emailed my office asking me to support impeachment.  I also know that some of you did not support impeachment, for multiple reasons.  I appreciate hearing from all of you.  I hope those who agreed and disagreed had the opportunity to see the House impeachment managers present the case this week.  Even Senator McConnell admitted after the trial that “[t]here’s no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day.”  I was disappointed in the final vote in the Senate, but note that in both the House and the Senate, this was the most bipartisan impeachment in the United States history – with 10 Republicans Representatives and 7 Republicans Senators voting to impeach and convict.  I was proud of the work the House managers did to present the case and the constitutional issues as I see them.   At the same time that the impeachment trial took place in the Senate, the House of Representatives worked to respond to the crisis presented by the COVID-19 pandemic.  And that was my primary focus this week. 
￼
The House of Representatives is working to enact President Biden’s American Rescue Plan as quickly as possible.  The Energy and Commerce Committee “marked up” the legislation to end the health and economic challenges caused by the coronavirus for two full days—more than 20 hours debating the provisions in our jurisdiction.  We voted to pass several items to provide relief for families and communities across the country, which will be included in a budget from the House very soon, including: 
	•	investing in a national vaccination program; 
	•	implementing a national testing strategy; 
	•	addressing health disparities for vulnerable populations; and
	•	increasing internet access as families continue remote working and learning.
I am glad that my bill to incentivize Medicaid expansion for Texas and other states that have not yet done so was included as a part of the COVID-19 relief package.  No one should have to worry about affording the health care they need—especially as we face this pandemic.  You can watch my statement during the markup on the vital need for our state to expand Medicaid here. 
￼
In addition to my work on the Energy and Commerce Committee, I was appointed to the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology this week, where I will build on the work I did there in the 116th Congress.
￼

In addition to committee work, I was glad to co-sponsor several critical bills this week, including: 

	•	The Pregnant Workers Fairness Act, to prohibit employment practices that discriminate against making reasonable accommodations for qualified employees affected by pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions; 
	•	The Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2021, to end racial and ethnic disparities in maternal health outcomes and achieve maternal health justice; 
	•	The Forced Arbitration Injustice Repeal (FAIR) Act, to restore the rights of workers and consumers by prohibiting corporations from forcing individuals into forced arbitration;  
	•	The Research Investment to Spark the Economy (RISE) Act, to provide $25 billion to award to various universities and research institutions to continue their work on ongoing federally funded projects; 
	•	A resolution to award the Congressional Gold Medal to U.S. Capitol Police. 
	•	A resolution expressing support for the Iranian people's desire for a democratic, secular, and nonnuclear Republic of Iran and condemning violations of human rights and state-sponsored terrorism by the Iranian Government.

I also joined my colleagues in sending several letters on matters of concern, including: 

	•	A letter to House and Senate leadership opposing the narrowing of eligibility for Economic Impact Payments in budget reconciliation
	•	A letter to HHS Secretary-Elect Becerra urging HHS to take immediate action to restore many covered entities’ access to lawful drug discounts under the 340B program. 
	•	A letter to Facebook regarding concerns about its advertising practices with my colleagues on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
And my team and I met with dozens of people virtually and over the telephone to talk about their concerns and legislative priorities.  You can see all the bills I have cosponsored at Congress.gov and you can view my full voting record on my website.
￼
Mark your calendars for this Thursday, February 18, 2021 at 6:05pm!  I am hosting another COVID-19 Telephone Town Hall.  As Congress and the new administration ramp up vaccine distribution, I want to make sure all your questions are answered.  I will be joined by representatives from the Texas Department of State Health Services and Harris County Public Health.   You can SIGN UP HERE to make sure you are on the call. 
￼
￼
In the last two weeks, there have been nearly 19,000 new cases of COVID-19 in Harris County.  The positivity rate for our region is 15.5%, a slight decrease from last week.  There is still a high concentration of COVID-19 around Cy-Fair, with more than 3,442 active cases as of Friday.  More than 40,000 people across our state Texas have passed away due to coronavirus—about half of them passed in the last three months.   Vaccinations are picking up across our state and our country, with the average number of vaccines administered daily increasing steadily since December.  Experts continue warn that most Americans won’t be vaccinated until the end of the summer.  With more contagious variants spreading across the country, it is as vital as ever that we continue taking precautions necessary to slow the spread of the virus: wear a mask and limit social gatherings.   As a reminder, because of the winter storm in our region, Harris County COVID19 testing sites and vaccination sites will be closed until Tuesday, February 16.  
￼
This week, I had the privilege and pleasure of meeting virtually with outstanding students from across our district who I had the honor to nominate for an appointment to U.S. military service academies.  I am inspired by their patriotism and desire to serve.  It represents the best of our community and country.  
￼

We were so happy to organize our second annual Valentines for Vets this year, THANK YOU to everyone who participated!  We had an incredible response from our TX-07 community, and our team delivered all the cards to veterans at the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center, thanking them for their service!

￼

And I wish you all a happy Valentine’s Day today and a Happy Lunar New Year to all who celebrate!
￼

As always, my team and I are here to serve you, and I hope you will let us know how we can, especially during these challenging times.  We are just a phone call or an email away—you can reach us at (713) 353-8680 or through email here.  I look forward to hearing from you!
With best wishes,

Special Enrollment Period
 
Dear Friend,  As the global pandemic continues, millions of Americans are facing new health concerns and also remain underinsured or uninsured and still need affordable health coverage. Thats why President Joe Biden signed an executive order calling for a Special Enrollment Period so you and your families can apply and enroll in the coverage you need.
 
Beginning Today, February 15, 2021, through March 15, 2021, you can purchase, change, or renew your health care plans under the Affordable Care Act for coverage starting on the 1st of the next month.
 
Visit Healthcare.gov to learn about the options that are available to you and your family.
  
￼
  
Most people using Healthcare.gov qualify for financial assistance and in 2019, 2 in 3 people found plans for $10 per month or less. Access to affordable health coverage is more important now than ever. Don’t go uncovered. Go to HealthCare.gov and find a quality affordable plan that works for you.
 And as always, if you have any questions, feel free to call my district office at (773) 267-5926.
Sincerely,
￼
  
Mike Quigley

2/15/21 10:25,Wicker Opposes Biden’s Spending Bill,"￼
Wicker Opposes Biden’s Spending Bill   $1.9 Trillion Package Not Necessary for Strong Recovery 
After a year of economic uncertainty, America received some encouraging news from the Congressional Budget Office this month. This non-partisan agency projected that our economy will return to its pre-pandemic size by the middle of this year, even without new stimulus from Congress. This report indicates that the foundations of our economy remain strong and that workers can expect more opportunity as vaccines reach more Americans. This positive forecast calls into question President Biden’s case for a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill, which he says is necessary to jumpstart our economy. 
Over the past year, Congress has approved $4 trillion in COVID-related relief to workers, families, and vulnerable sectors of our economy. Over $1 trillion of this money still remains to be distributed, making Mr. Biden’s proposal premature. The President’s plan also contains a number of wasteful priorities that do not address the nation’s most pressing needs. 
Biden’s Bill Pushes Partisan Agenda 
Republicans have proposed a new round of cash payments targeted for those who are most in need. Many Americans who would receive checks under President Biden’s proposal, however, have not missed a paycheck during this crisis. These massive payments would add to the mountain of debt that our children and grandchildren will have to repay. In addition, the President’s proposal would use taxpayer dollars to bail out pension funds in poorly-run states like Illinois. It would allow union-controlled school districts, such as those in Chicago and Los Angeles, to receive billions in aid without reopening classrooms. And it would allow Planned Parenthood affiliates—which previously had been barred from COVID relief funds—to receive taxpayer-funded aid. 
In another troubling development, Democrats are getting behind Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’s proposal to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. Although this might bring a pay raise to some, it would devastate small businesses and result in many Americans losing their jobs or having reduced work hours. The Congressional Budget Office projects that a $15 minimum wage would cost the nation 1.4 million jobs, and the Heritage Foundation has estimated Mississippi would lose more than 120,000 jobs. 
Restaurants in particular would be devastated by this policy. The food service industry has already suffered roughly one out of four job losses from the pandemic. Many restaurants are now hanging by a thread, and this proposal could wipe them out for good. Now is the worst possible time to impose such a heavy burden on our small businesses. 
America Needs Targeted Relief 
Instead of undermining job creators and spending unnecessary trillions, Congress should play a constructive role by sending relief where it is actually needed. Last year, I introduced the RESTAURANTS Act to create a fund to help independently-owned restaurants survive the COVID-19 crisis. Congress recently adopted the outline of this proposal by an overwhelming vote of 90-10. This measure will extend a critical lifeline to struggling restaurants across America. 
The more modest and targeted Republican plan would include new funding for vaccine development and distribution, as well as replenishing the Paycheck Protection Program, which has helped many small businesses stay afloat during this crisis. Above all, Congress needs to focus on helping rather than undermining our recovery. All five COVID bills last year were passed with near-unanimous bipartisan support. I hope President Biden will back away from his partisan proposal and make good on his pledge to work with Republicans to meet our nation’s needs.

Dear Friend,
  
The IRS began accepting 2020 tax filings on February 12. Completing your tax forms can raise a lot of questions, especially if you've experienced any income-related impacts due to COVID-19.
 
I wanted to share some information and tips for filing your return this year, including economic impact payments, refunds, volunteer tax assistance and security awareness.
  
 
FILING YOUR TAXES
 
  
The deadline to file your 2020 taxes is April 15, 2021. If you do not file on time, you risk penalties. If you need more time, you can submit a filing extension for free online, which will give you until October 15 to file.
 
The quickest way to receive your tax refund is to file electronically and provide your banking information for direct deposit.
 
If you prefer to file your taxes on a paper form, you can download those forms from the IRS and print them at home. Those without access to a computer or printer can request them directly from the IRS at 1-800-TAX-FORM (1-800-829-3676).
  
 
SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
 
If you received unemployment insurance income in 2020, it is taxable and must be claimed on your return.
 
Due to COVID-19 delays last year, the IRS was unable to process all returns in a timely manner meaning many people received interest with their 2019 tax refund. This interest is taxable and must be claimed on your 2020 return. 
 
Economic impact payments (also known as stimulus checks) received in 2020 and January 2021 were an advance payment of the 2020 Recovery Rebate Credit. It is not considered income and you will not be taxed on it. If you were eligible and did not get an Economic Impact Payment or it was less than expected, you should claim it on the 2020 tax return as the Recovery Rebate Credit. Learn more here.
  
 
PROCESSING
 
  
Tax return processing time can vary depending on how and when you submitted your return as well as the credits you claim. The IRS estimates that e-filing with a direct deposit refund will take 1-3 weeks, whereas e-filing with a check refund takes approximately 1 month. Mailed returns typically take 3 weeks to 2 months depending on your refund delivery method.
 
Check the status of your return on Where's My Refund? to confirm the IRS has received it. Your return can be tracked 24 hours after electronic receipt or 4 weeks from the date it was mailed. Do not attempt to file your return twice.
 
Amended returns take longer than original tax returns. It may take up to three weeks to show up on the Where’s My Amended Return system and up to 16 weeks to be processed. Check status here. 
  
 
TAX PREPARATION RESOURCES
 
  
Tax preparation assistance programs are provided throughout the Central Coast including the United Way VITA program and AARP Tax Aide. Despite operating virtually this year, they are open and ready to assist you. 
 
The Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program offers free tax help to people who generally make $57,000 or less, persons with disabilities and limited English-speaking taxpayers who need assistance preparing their own tax returns. IRS-certified volunteers provide free basic income tax return preparation with electronic filing to qualified individuals.
 
AARP Foundation Tax-Aid offers free tax preparation help to anyone regardless of age or finances, though seniors and low-income individuals take priority. Virtual appointments can be scheduled with IRS-certified volunteers throughout the region.

VIRTUAL RESOURCES
 
MyFreeTaxes.com is available for individuals and families earning up to $66,000. This assistance is free. 
 
Individuals with incomes under $72,000 can use an IRS Free File partner. 
  
 
PROTECT YOUR IDENTITY
 
  
The IRS will never initiate contact by email text or social media to request personal or financial information. It will never call taxpayers with threats of lawsuits or arrests. And it will never call, email or text to request taxpayers’ identity protection PINs. 
 
More information to protect yourself from identity theft can be found here. 
  
Many other factors may affect your tax filing. I know this continues to be a very difficult time for our community. If you are in need of assistance, please don't hesitate to reach out to my office at the numbers below.
  
Sincerely,
￼
  
Congressman Salud Carbajal

Weekly Wrap up with 
Congressman Byron Donalds
                             February 16, 2021
 
 
Last week, I took part in two committee bill markups. I introduced amendments to bloated Democratic bills that do not put the American people first and leave our future generations with a massive price tag. 
 
While our nation continues to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, I led my colleagues in the Florida Republican delegation, where we called on the Biden Administration to rethink reported efforts to ban travel to our home state. Such a measure does not follow the science nor the United States Constitution.
 
Lastly, on this President's Day, we honor the life and legacy of our first President and true American hero, George Washington. For more than two centuries, courageous and proud Americans have taken the solemn oath to protect and defend our beloved nation, and we thank all those who have served our country.

District Updates
 
Last week, I had the pleasure of attending a luncheon at American Legion - Post 38, the oldest Post in Southwest Florida, and to meet the James W. Oxford, the National Commander of the American Legion. 
 
I am incredibly grateful to all who have served, past and present, to protect and defend our freedoms.  
 
￼
 
 

 
 
Legislative Updates
 
Florida has benefited from many liberal governors and mayors' burdensome policies that have forced businesses and residents to freer and more prosperous states like here at home. As a result,  Florida's real estate market has boomed as people from all across our country are buying property sight unseen, and businesses are flocking to the Sunshine State. 
 
Just last week, the New York Stock Exchange warned politicians in New York to reconsider their overbearing tax system or else they will look for another state to do business. The NYSE embodies the principles of capitalism, free markets, and American exceptionalism. If New York is distancing itself from those values, the Sunshine State will proudly welcome the world's largest stocks exchange in Southwest Florida. Read my full statement below: 
 
 
￼

 
Last week, I led the Florida Congressional Delegation opposing President Biden's potential Florida travel ban. My Floridian colleagues and I sent a letter to the President expressing our concerns with his reported proposal. 
 
Americans continue to appreciate FL's response to the pandemic juxtaposed to the authoritarian measures in blue states that have shown little to no success in controlling the virus. Any unconstitutional or partisan plan to ban travel to Florida is anti-science & anti-Constitution.
 
Read the full letter below:

The education of our students can't wait. Reopening schools means reopening our country, and the Biden Administration must start that now.

Dear Lindsey Cormack,
Those who missed open enrollment season now have a new opportunity to apply for 2021 health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace. Due to the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, President Biden has issued a Special Enrollment Period for individuals and families seeking coverage. Eligible people now have an additional three months to find a health insurance plan in the ACA marketplace from February 15th to May 15th, 2021.  Anyone in need of health insurance can apply through the marketplace. There is no requirement to provide proof of a major life event such as loss of a job to enroll. To see if you qualify, complete the Healthcare Screener. Many individuals are eligible for financial assistance to cover part of the monthly premium. You can learn more at www.healthcare.gov. 
Get Covered – Apply for Health Insurance 
I encourage you to take the time to explore what options are available to you and your family. Along with HealthCare.gov, you can utilize the following websites for North Carolina-based resources, which include instructions on speaking with health care “navigators” who are trained to help people evaluate their health care options:
	•	NC Get Covered
	•	NC Navigator
	•	NC Department of Health and Human Services 
Health care must be affordable and available for every American, especially during a global pandemic. We are facing enormous public health and economic challenges in this country. As we work on pandemic recovery legislation, I will continue to advocate for policies that that expand – not restrict – access to affordable, high-quality health coverage.
I want to leave you with a simple reminder. As COVID-19 cases continue to rise, please do your part to help slow the spread of the virus and protect your neighbors by following the three W’s: wear a mask, wait six feet apart, and wash your hands.
Sincerely, 
￼

2/16/21 10:20,Weekly Update:  U.S. Attorneys Should Be Allowed To Conclude Their Important Work,"

Weekly Update | February 13, 2021
 

U.S. Attorneys Should Be Allowed To Conclude Their Important Work

While U.S. Attorneys ultimately serve at the pleasure of the President, I believe it would be reckless and irresponsible for President Biden to fire U.S. Attorneys John Lausch, of the Northern District of Illinois, and John Milhiser, of the Central District of Illinois, without successors nominated and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. U.S. Attorney Lausch is currently pursuing a historic and major public corruption investigation involving a years-long bribery scheme that has implicated former House Speaker Michael Madigan and others. U.S. Attorney Milhiser recently announced an indictment against former State Senator Sam McCann for criminal charges, including fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion.
 
There is precedent for allowing a U.S. Attorney to remain in office until successors are confirmed, and I strongly believe both should be allowed to do so. I urge President Biden to permit U.S. Attorneys Lausch and Milhiser to remain in their jobs to conclude their ongoing corruption investigations and criminal cases.

Talking With K-12 School Administrators on Re-Opening
 

Pictured above: I talked with K-12 school administrators during a virtual listening session on Wednesday, February 10th 

On Wednesday, I hosted a Virtual COVID-19 Listening Session with K-12 School Administrators with two dozen school districts from across the 13th Congressional District participating. The discussion focused on the status of each district's transition back to in-person learning and what needs to happen to accomplish that transition. There were three common issues raised by local school administrators: funding, vaccines, and public health guidance. 

The vast majority of schools across my district are providing full-time or at least partial in-person learning and I am grateful for the administrators, teachers, and students for making that happen. I represent both rural and urban school districts and recognize they face different sets of challenges, but it is important we all work together to get schools reopened. 

I voted for additional federal funding for schools and vaccine distribution in December and that funding is on the way. Our kids deserve the best learning environment we can give them. That is undeniably in-person instruction and the science shows we can make that happen sooner rather than later.

You can learn more about our discussion here. 
 


Talking With County Health Departments on COVID-19 Vaccine Administration
 

Pictured above: I listened to county health department administrators during a virtual listening session on Monday, February 8th

On Monday, I hosted a Virtual COVID-19 Listening Session with County Health Departments with most all department administrators across the 13th Congressional District participating. The discussion focused on vaccine administration, testing operations, and contact tracing. Bolstering vaccine supply, funding to get shots in arms, and earlier notification of dosage allotments to improve planning were the main areas local leaders indicated they need support from the state and federal government. 

Our local county health departments are doing an admirable job of getting vaccines administered while still continuing testing and contact tracing operations. I heard clear and consistently that departments need more vaccines, further advance communication of allotments for planning purposes, and additional funding to get shots into arms. 

In December I voted for legislation that included billions of dollars for purchasing vaccines and distributing them. I will continue to listen to our public health officials leading the fight against the pandemic to see how we can best support their efforts. The sooner we get people vaccinated the sooner we can get back to normal. 

I continue to urge the Governor to take steps necessary to get shots into arms. With hard-working, capable county health department staff like the folks I spoke to yesterday there is no reason our state should be ranked at the tail-end of most vaccination measures.

You can learn more about our discussion here. 
 

Editorial: ""Biden Sacks a Corruption Prober""

President Joe Biden and his Department of Justice announced their intent to terminate dozens of U.S. Attorneys across the country, including John Lausch of the Northern District of Illinois. Editorial boards and lawmakers from both parties urged President Biden to allow Lausch to stay on the job until he concludes his work and a successor is confirmed.

From the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board: Biden Sacks a Corruption Prober: 

“A new President abruptly fires a prosecutor overseeing high-level political corruption cases. That’s big news, right? Well, it was in 2017 when President Trump axed Preet Bharara, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York at the time and a media favorite. You can tell power in Washington has changed hands because of the muted response as the Biden White House ousts U.S. Attorney John Lausch of the Northern District of Illinois.
 
“Joe Biden is swiftly pushing out almost all U.S. attorneys who served under his predecessor, which is increasingly the norm for new Presidents. But even Illinois Sens. Dick Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, staunch allies of Mr. Biden, objected to his firing of Mr. Lausch, who has been a scourge of corruption in Democratic-dominated Springfield.
 
“…Mr. Lausch’s corruption probes have implicated a Chicago alderman and Springfield politicians. In July 2020 his office announced a $200 million settlement with the state’s primary electric utility company for its efforts to buy off “associates of a high-level elected official for the state of Illinois.”
 
“That official is reported to be Michael Madigan, who until last month had been Speaker of the Illinois House for all but two years since 1983. The investigation is continuing, and there’s no reason outside of politics that Mr. Lausch shouldn’t be kept on the job until the Senate confirms a successor. Mr. Lausch’s four-year term ends in November 2021, and getting a replacement could take that long…”

From the Chicago Tribune Editorial Board: President Biden: Keep our U.S. Attorney John Lausch: 

“President Joe Biden’s Justice Department dismissed U.S. attorneys across the country appointed by former President Donald Trump on Tuesday, and Northern District of Illinois U.S. Attorney John Lausch appears to be out. That would be a terrible decision by Biden.
 
“…And what a coincidence that the politicians indicted, charged or under investigation so far happen to be mostly Democrats. Dismissing Lausch will look like a Biden-Durbin-Duckworth favor to their corrupt Democrat pals.
 
“…Lausch also has been helping Mayor Lori Lightfoot in Chicago with violent crime. The effort known as Operation Legend, which fanned across several U.S. cities to battle increases in crime, was credited as of last fall with 262 charges of firearm offenses in the Northern District, a number 33% higher than 2018 and 48% higher than 2017, according to the Trump Justice Department.”

2/16/21 11:30,ICYMI: Espaillat Named Champion for Children,"￼ 
  

For Immediate Release
February 16, 2021


Standing Up For Our Children, Fighting For Our Families

By Representative Adriano Espaillat

Original Article Published in Patch.com
February 11, 2021


￼

2020 was a rough year for our nation, and in particular, for our children. The coronavirus pandemic and its economic fallout closed their schools, pushed more than 2 million of them into poverty, sent record numbers of them to bed hungry, and affected every aspect of their social and emotional lives. 

In Congress, some of my colleagues and I worked hard to mitigate these effects on our children. We introduced or supported key pieces of legislation on children’s health insurance, hunger, homelessness, tax credits, treatment of immigrant children, and other issues critical to advancing the needs of our kids and families.

For these efforts, the bipartisan advocacy organization First Focus Campaign for Children recently named me a 2020 Champion for Children. The nonprofit’s 2020 Legislative Scorecard recognizes 120 lawmakers across both parties and chambers who have worked to prioritize children.

Awards are nice. They make us feel good. And they can signal to our constituents that perhaps we are getting things done. But the work behind this award is what really matters.

During these extraordinary times amid COVID-19, families really didn’t have a choice but to opt out of in-person instruction and choose remote learning full-time. The transition has been undoubtedly difficult, so I joined efforts with New York City’s Department of Education to help close the digital divide which is core to the systemic and institutional inequity that threatens the prosperity of our communities, an inequity further exacerbated by COVID-19. Through our efforts, we were able to successfully distribute over 70,000 devices to students across each of the school districts within New York’s 13th congressional district. 

Once students received their devices, my office understood that parents were struggling with the various remote learning platforms. As a solution, my team worked once again with the City’s Department of Education to create a 10-week program to provide weekly remote learning support workshops for parents and caregivers. These weekly sessions will cover a range of topics, including best practices to navigate remote learning for students with disabilities, multilingual learners, and more topics in both English and Spanish.

Additionally, as part of my legislative efforts in Washington, during the end of the 116th legislative calendar, I was able to successfully help secure an extra $2.5 million for WIC’s Farmers’ Market Nutrition Program as part of the House Appropriations bill. We must continue such efforts to increase funding for vital programs that support Women and Infant Children by helping those with WIC program nutrition assistance purchase fresh produce from locally sourced farmers markets. Furthermore, I have long fought in opposition to the now-former Trump Administration on its harmful Public Charge Rule, which had terrible chilling effects on immigrant families’ access to public services. Thankfully, the Biden Administration is now reviewing the rule and moving forward to undo this terrible assault on immigrant families.

These are just a few of my efforts to ensure support and protections for children and families. Children in all parts of our country need more attention than lawmakers traditionally have given them. Children make up one-quarter of our population, but we spend just 7.48% of the federal budget on them, even as the global pandemic threatens to reverse economic gains made since the Great Recession.

Research from the nonpartisan Opportunity Insights project suggests that for every dollar invested in children, our nation gets $1.47 back. Yet the share of federal spending on kids has declined 9% over the last five fiscal years.

This trend must not continue. It is up to us – members of Congress – and the public that supports us, to demand that we put “the best interest of the child” first. Only when we do that, will we finally, truly put the best interest of our country first.

Defendiendo a nuestros Niños, Luchando por nuestras Familias
Por el congresista Adriano Espaillat  Artículo original publicado en Patch.com 11 de febrero de 2021  

El 2020 fue un año duro para nuestra nación y, en particular, para nuestros niños. La pandemia del coronavirus y sus consecuencias económicas cerraron sus escuelas, empujó a más de 2 millones de ellos a la pobreza, envió a un número récord de ellos a la cama con hambre y afectó todos los aspectos de su vida social y emocional.

En el Congreso, algunos de mis colegas y yo trabajamos arduamente para mitigar estos efectos en nuestros niños. Introdujimos o apoyamos leyes clave sobre el seguro médico de los niños, el hambre, la falta de vivienda, los créditos fiscales, el tratamiento de los niños inmigrantes y otros temas críticos para avanzar en suplir las necesidades de nuestros niños y familias.

Por estos esfuerzos, la organización de defensa bipartidista First Focus Campaign for Children recientemente me nombró Champion for Children 2020 (Defesor de los Niños 2020). La Tarjeta de Puntuación Legislativa 2020 de la organización sin fines de lucro reconoce a 120 legisladores de ambos partidos y cámaras que han trabajado para dar prioridad a los niños.

Los premios son agradables. Nos hacen sentir bien. Y pueden indicar a nuestros constituyentes que tal vez estamos logrando que las cosas se hagan. Pero el trabajo detrás de este premio es lo que realmente importa.

Durante estos tiempos extraordinarios en medio del COVID-19, las familias realmente no tuvieron más remedio que optar por no recibir instrucción en persona y elegir el aprendizaje remoto a tiempo completo. La transición ha sido indudablemente difícil, por lo que uní esfuerzos con el Departamento de Educación de la Ciudad de Nueva York para ayudar a cerrar la brecha digital que es fundamental para evitar la inequidad sistémica e institucional que amenaza la prosperidad de nuestras comunidades, una inequidad agravada por el COVID-19. Gracias a nuestros esfuerzos, pudimos distribuir con éxito más de 70,000 dispositivos a los estudiantes en cada uno de los distritos escolares dentro del distrito congresual 13 de Nueva York.

Una vez que los estudiantes recibieron sus dispositivos, mi oficina entendió que los padres estaban teniendo dificultades con las diversas plataformas de aprendizaje remoto. Como solución, mi equipo trabajó una vez más con el Departamento de Educación de la Ciudad para crear un programa de 10 semanas para brindar talleres semanales de apoyo al aprendizaje remoto para padres y cuidadores. Estas sesiones semanales cubrirán una variedad de temas, incluidas las mejores prácticas para navegar el aprendizaje remoto para estudiantes con discapacidades, estudiantes multilingües y otros temas tanto en inglés como en español.

Además, como parte de mis esfuerzos legislativos en Washington, durante el final del 116º calendario legislativo, pude ayudar con éxito a asegurar $2.5 millones adicionales para el Programa de Nutrición del Mercado de Agricultores de WIC como parte del proyecto de ley de Apropiaciones de la Cámara. Debemos continuar con esos esfuerzos para aumentar los fondos para programas vitales que apoyan a mujeres y bebés, ayudando a quienes reciben asistencia nutricional del programa WIC a comprar productos frescos de los mercados de agricultores de origen local. Además, he luchado durante mucho tiempo en oposición a la ahora ex Administración Trump por su dañina Regla de Carga Pública, que tuvo terribles efectos en el acceso de las familias inmigrantes a los servicios públicos. Afortunadamente, la Administración Biden ahora está revisando la regla y avanzando para deshacer este terrible asalto a las familias inmigrantes.

Estos son solo algunos de mis esfuerzos para garantizar el apoyo y la protección de los niños y las familias. Los niños de todas partes de nuestro país necesitan más atención de la que tradicionalmente les han prestado los legisladores. Los niños constituyen una cuarta parte de nuestra población, pero gastamos solo el 7.48% del presupuesto federal en ellos, incluso cuando la pandemia mundial amenaza con revertir los avances económicos obtenidos desde la Gran Recesión.

La investigación del proyecto no partidista Opportunity Insights sugiere que por cada dólar invertido en los niños, nuestra nación recupera $1.47. Sin embargo, la proporción del gasto federal en niños ha disminuido un 9% durante los últimos cinco años fiscales.

Esta tendencia no debe continuar. Depende de nosotros, los miembros del Congreso, y del público que nos apoya, exigir que pongamos en primer lugar “los mejores intereses del niño”. Solo cuando hagamos eso, final y verdaderamente pondremos los mejores intereses de nuestro país en primer lugar.

2/16/21 13:24,Op-ed: The SolarWinds cyberhack is a blow. The U.S. must prioritize cybersecurity now.,"￼ 
Contact:  Marty Cozza 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
February 16, 2021
￼ 
Op-ed: The SolarWinds cyberhack is a blow. The U.S. must prioritize cybersecurity now. 
By U.S. Senator Jim Risch - February 9, 2021 
December’s revelation that U.S. government agencies and our largest corporations were subject to a hyper-sophisticated cyberattack was not unexpected, but the breadth of the SolarWinds hack was shocking. FireEye, a world leader on cybersecurity, stated the company had never witnessed a breach of this scope and magnitude. In a blog post disclosing the attack, FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia wrote, “We are witnessing an attack by a nation with top-tier offensive capabilities.” It was evident just how serious the situation was.
Then the other shoe dropped. Days after the initial report disclosing the breach, we learned that the SolarWinds hack impacted thousands more entities than previously believed and is still ongoing as we speak. Through a series of seemingly innocuous software updates, hostile actors penetrated our networks and spread undetected for months like a metastatic cancer.
We don’t yet know the full extent of what assets were compromised in SolarWinds, something that will take months or longer to assess. What is clear is very few nation-states have the cyber capabilities needed to orchestrate a hack of this sophistication, and SolarWinds bears all the hallmarks of Russian malign activity.
Malware and cyberattacks are something of a Russian specialty and remain their tools of choice because they are cheap to execute and can wreak maximum havoc. In 2007, a massive Russian cyberattack crippled Estonia’s government and economy for three weeks. Eight years later, Russia hit Ukraine’s critical infrastructure with a cyberattack that cut off power to hundreds of thousands of people.
It is critical we respond with a clear, forceful message to the Russians and any others who wish to do the United States harm. For now, the SolarWinds hack is considered an egregious act of espionage, stealing data and establishing unauthorized access of information technology. If it becomes clear the actions also impact operational technology (the operation of physical processes or systems), it must be considered an attack and the realm of potential responses greatly escalates.
Next, we must move past jurisdictional grandstanding to develop a national cybersecurity strategy. Once we identify the vulnerabilities that allowed this hack to take place, we need a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity that keeps the United States a step ahead of its adversaries. The Idaho National Lab has been at the forefront of this work with its Consequence-driven Cyber-informed Engineering (CCE), which urges leaders in industry and cyber professionals to think like an adversary by developing techniques to defend our most critical systems by isolating them in order to limit attack options. While our coordination on these issues has improved in recent years, greater collaboration between the federal government, businesses, national labs and our energy sector will unite our greatest strengths to protect our most sensitive systems and information from hostile foreign actors.
Finally, we need a long-term solution to build and maintain a deep bench of cybersecurity professionals. Early exposure to STEM education, computer coding and cyber curriculum can inspire a whole new generation of students to pursue a career in cyber. Meanwhile, our universities have an opportunity to evolve with the changing workforce to facilitate a pipeline of talented individuals to succeed in a fast-paced, well-paid and highly-skilled career in cybersecurity.
SolarWinds has set us on a course to one of two eventualities: allow ourselves to fall victim to bureaucratic paralysis by analysis, or act decisively to enact policies to ensure America’s cyber dominance for decades to come. Let it be the latter.

 Thought of the day: “It’s not about perfect. It’s about effort. And when you bring that effort every single day, that is where transformation happens. That’s how change occurs.” – Jillian Michaels  
￼

For me, Pączki Day has always been important and was one of John’s favorite traditions. The Dingell family immigrated to the United States from Poland, and Pączki Day is a Polish celebration of Fat Tuesday – the last chance to indulge before the fasting days of Lent. Celebrating this heritage on Pączki Day with friends each year is a reminder that our heritage is important. Though our celebration may look different this year, traditions such as this keep us connected and tie generations together.
Coronavirus Update

On Monday, Michigan reported 1,265 new cases of COVID-19 and 8 new deaths, bringing the state’s total cases to 575,489 and deaths to 15,158. Michigan’s COVID numbers continue to trend in a hopeful direction, with a current positivity rate is 4.5%. Governor Whitmer’s science-based actions have been effective in mitigating the spread of COVID. As our health care professionals continue working to vaccinate Michiganders, we have got to stay committed to following the CDC’s guidelines, by wearing a mask (two is better than one, according to the CDC), keeping our physical distance, and washing our hands.  
The UK COVID variant is threatening to potentially reverse the recent declines in case numbers since the state’s peak at the end of November. Yesterday, Michigan reported at least 67 confirmed cases of the more contagious variant, with two-thirds of those in Washtenaw County. As COVID variations spread, we all need to be even more vigilant and careful.
On Monday, Michigan reported 2,294,775 COVID vaccines have been distributed and, of that, 1,634,609 vaccines have been administered. With the Biden Administration expanding vaccine distribution to 41 qualified health centers throughout Michigan, Michiganders now have more options available to receive one of the life-saving vaccines. Michiganders may visit Michigan.gov/COVIDVaccine for the most up-to-date information on vaccine eligibility, safety information, and clinic locations. Residents without or with limited access to the internet, or have difficulty accessing the information online, can call the state’s COVID-19 hotline at 888-535-6136 Monday through Friday, 8 am to 5 pm.
President Biden is working to improve the distribution and volume of vaccines being delivered to states. Much work still needs to be done as many Americans continue to experience difficulties in getting a vaccine, even when eligible, and health centers are forced to cancel appointments due to shortages. 
On Thursday, President Biden will travel to Michigan to meet with workers at Pfizer as the Administration continues work to increase the supply and availability of vaccines. Last week, the Biden Administration secured a deal with Pfizer and Moderna for an additional 100 million doses of each of their vaccines. There’s no time to waste. We must do everything we can to address vaccine shortages and quickly get shots into the arms of as many as possible.
Local pharmacies like Meijer and Rite Aid have launched webpages to provide the most up-to-date information on their vaccination plans, including options for eligible Michiganders to pre-register and schedule appointments for COVID vaccines online or by phone.
Michigan continues to prioritize vaccines for those 65 and older, front-line workers, some state and federal workers, jail and prison staff, Pre-K through 12th-grade teachers, and childcare providers.
To pre-register with a Meijer Pharmacy, visit their online pre-registration form or text “COVID” to 75049 or call your local Meijer Pharmacy. Visit Meijer Pharmacy’s COVID vaccination webpage for more information.
To check your eligibility and schedule a COVID vaccine appointment with Rite Aid, visit their COVID-19 Vaccine Scheduler.  
￼
In the midst of a global health care crisis, having comprehensive health care coverage has never been more important. With this in mind, President Biden has announced An ACA Special Enrollment Period, empowering Americans without adequate health care coverage to shop for a plan that meets their needs at HealthCare.gov.
ACCESS Community Health & Research Center is providing free, independent assistance during the Special Enrollment Period to residents needing help enrolling in the right plan for their needs.
President Biden has also taken action to extend the COVID-19 forbearance and foreclosure protections for homeowners through Jun 30, 2021. The President’s order places a moratorium on federally guaranteed mortgage foreclosures through June 30; extends the mortgage payment forbearance enrollment window for borrowers through June 30; and provides up to six months of additional mortgage payment forbearance, in three-month increments, for borrowers who entered forbearance on or before June 30, 2021.

 Legislative Update
Work continues this week in Congress to speed desperately needed aid to individuals, families, and small businesses, with House committees of jurisdiction continuing to work on President Biden’s American Rescue Plan. The President’s recovery plan includes funds to expand COVID-19 vaccinations, scale up testing, provide support to small businesses, aid schools in safely reopening, expand and improve critical Home- and Community-Based Services, extend assistance for the unemployed, deliver $1,400 survival checks to most Americans, and much more.
The urgency to pass this critical legislation has never been clearer. States are facing budget shortfalls, employment for women has hit a 33-year low, and COVID variants have begun to spread in our communities. We must act with the urgency this moment demands and get this bill signed into law by March.
Last month, along with 77 of our colleagues, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib (MI-13) and I introduced a measure that would create a $1.5 billion fund for local communities to assist with paying water bills for low-income residents. This legislation, supported by nearly 100 organizations, would require all cities and counties to reconnect service and impose a shutoff moratorium to receive federal funding. These requirements will not only help residents and local governments in the short term by providing access to water and funding to assist our front-line communities; they will also provide long-term solutions that will ensure everyone permanently has access to clean, affordable water.
This week, Congresswoman Tlaib and I called for immediate action on this legislation to treat access to clean water, especially in the midst of a global health crisis, what it is – a basic human right. Every person deserves the right of access to safe, clean water no matter their financial status.

Extreme Weather Situation Update
Guidance and Resources for North Texas
 
Fellow Texans,
 
This massive storm system has brought snow, sleet, and freezing rain to North Texas. Millions across the state have experienced power outages and here in Collin County we are facing single digit temperatures. Treacherous travel conditions and reduced internet and cellular data service is further exacerbating the situation.
 
While our entire state is under a Federal Emergency Declaration, further inclement weather is anticipated later this week.
 
Residents across Collin County have reported complete power outages as well as rolling blackouts which may continue for an extended period of time.
 
While ERCOT, ONCOR, COSERV, and other service providers are working around the clock to restore power, there is no guaranteed resolution time frame and Collin County residents need to take extra precautions to be prepared for the coming days.
 
Below are resources to help keep you and your family safe during this difficult time. If you need help accessing additional information, and have access to a working phone, please contact my office at (202) 225-4201.

Guidance for High-Risk Residents 
High risk individuals, such as seniors, those with certain health concerns, or families with infants, experiencing extended power outages, should make arrangements to stay with family, friends, or a neighbor who has power. Locally, shelters and warming centers are opening to the public. A list of these locations can be found at the bottom of this email.
 
If you or a loved one depends on electric or battery powered medical devices such as respirators, ventilators, oxygen machines, or home dialysis equipment, please contact your healthcare provider immediately. If you are experiencing a health emergency, don't take any chances and call 911 right away. 
 
Keep Warm
When the power goes out in winter, the cold can be dangerous however, there are ways to stay warm:
	•	Wear layers of warm clothing
	•	Close blinds and curtains to retain heat
	•	Stuff towels/rags in cracks under doors
	•	Close off rooms to avoid wasting heat
Stay Safe
Follow these simple rules to help keep you and your family safe during the winter weather emergency:
	•	If possible, delay travel plans and avoid driving on slick roads 
	•	Never use a charcoal grill, stove or oven to heat your home
	•	Keep indoor space heaters at least feet from other items
	•	Place generators outdoors and away from windows, keep them dry and properly grounded, and never plug them into a wall outlet or main electrical panel
	•	Boil water notices are currently in effect for the Town of Anna and the City of Princeton
Conserve Energy 
If your household continues to have power, please take these critical steps to conserve usage and reduce the burden on the power grid:
	•	Turn down thermostats to 68 or lower 
	•	Close shades and blinds to reduce the amount of heat lost through windows
	•	Turn off and unplug non-essential lights and appliances 
	•	Avoid using large appliances like ovens and washing machines

The American Rescue Plan
 
February 16, 2021
  
 ¿Quiere leer este boletín en español? Haga clic aquí. 
 
Dear Neighbor,  
Last week, Congress continued our work on COVID-19 relief legislation. President Biden’s American Rescue Plan is on track to be finalized and hopefully pass in the weeks ahead. As people continue to struggle from this unprecedented pandemic, I will continue to fight to get direct payments to each person and invest in the equitable distribution of vaccines. 
 
This past Saturday was a sad day in our country. The Senate had an opportunity to hold our former president accountable for his role in trying to stop democracy and inciting and encouraging the U.S. Capitol riots on January 6th. Several weeks ago, I voted in favor of impeachment because I believe that no one is above the law. Unfortunately, on Saturday a number of Republican senators ignored the facts, the evidence, and their constitutional duty when they put one man above their solemn oath to defend and protect the Constitution.
 
Even though the impeachment vote fell short, I am grateful for the Senators that were willing to put their oath first to deliver the largest bipartisan vote for presidential conviction in history. I also applaud the amazing work by the House Impeachment managers who laid our such a compelling case. Lastly, I continue to thank Capitol Hill police officers their heroism on that dreadful January 6th day. They deserve the Congressional Medal of Honor.
 
In this newsletter, you will find new information about vaccines, opportunities for free internet access, our upcoming events, and legislative updates.
  
 
Vaccine Updates and Information
 
  
￼
Vaccine appointments are available for those who qualify. Continue to check the website or call 833-540-0473 between 8 am & 8:30 pm to book an appointment, but supply is still limited. You may have to try a few times to get an appointment. CVS Health is also providing limited vaccination appointments, and you can sign up here.
 
Remember: the L.A. County sites (Pomona Fairplex, The Forum, Cal State Northridge, Six Flax Magic Mountain, and the Downey Education Building) and the city-run sites like Dodger Stadium can sometimes operate under different rules.
 
  
 
More Vaccine Sites in our Community
 
Thousands of appointments suddenly became available this week. Please continue to check the site frequently and let your friends, family, and neighbors know when you see openings.
 
Dignity Health has announced that COVID-19 Vaccinations are available in Carson by appointment until February 19th. Appointments here.
 
The Biden Administration announced this week it plans to send doses of COVID vaccine directly to community health centers, something I’ve been pushing for in order to ensure a more equitable distribution.
 
￼
  
It’s important to have enough vaccines at these sites in the communities that are most impacted. Both AltaMed and JWCH have locations in the district and have been approved for vaccines. If you are eligible for a vaccine, please contact these sites and inquire about appointments. I’m still concerned about the equity in the vaccine rollout, and will continue to push to get more doses into our communities.
 
What to bring to a Vaccine Appointment
 
If you’re eligible for the vaccine and are able to secure an appointment, make sure you bring the appropriate documents to your appointment. Those 65+ must bring proof of age and proof of residency.  The full list of required documents for vaccinations through L.A. County can be found here. If you’re being vaccinated through a site run by a different entity, please make sure you confirm what documents you are required to bring.
 
Long Beach Vaccinations
 
The rules in Long Beach are different than in the rest of L.A. County. Here’s who’s currently eligible: Subject to vaccine availability
	•	Healthcare workers
	•	Long Term Care Facility Residents
	•	Anyone age 65+
	•	Government Emergency Response
	•	Food or Agriculture Worker
	•	Education and Childcare
Visit VaxLB for more information on how to make your appointment in Long Beach. 
 
State public health officials just announced that starting March 15, people ages 16 to 64 who are at highest risk if they catch the coronavirus, including people with cancer, chronic lung disease and various heart conditions will be eligible for the vaccine. Stay safe and protect our community in the meantime! Remember that wearing a mask is the best thing we can do right now to save lives.
  
 
COVID-19 Updates
 
  
California continues to see improvement in the fight against COVID-19. Hospitalizations are down 34 percent in the last two weeks and ICU admissions are also down 24 percent. Daily case numbers and test positivity rates have also been drastically cut. All of this was achieved thanks to your efforts to stay home and wear your mask. By continuing to do so, you’re continuing to save lives! 
  
￼
 
We are still seeing troubling signs as a new COVID strain from the UK spreads across the nation. This new strain is more infectious and public health experts advise that you “double-mask” (wear one mask on top of the other) when you go out in public. 1 in 10 Californians have now been vaccinated and the situation should improve as this number goes up. Until then, please keep up your efforts to stay safe and save lives.

Here’s a video laying out the common mistakes and obstacles that people face when filing for unemployment in California. Understand the continued claim certification questions here. Remember:
	•	Answering YES to “Were you too sick to work during this time?” will disqualify you.
	•	Answering NO to “Are you available to work?” will disqualify you.

COVID Relief Priorities
 
The Congressional Progressive Caucus, of which I'm a member, recently released its top 5 priorities for the upcoming COVID-19 relief package. They include: 
	•	Increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour.
	•	Automatic enrollment for the uninsured and unemployed into Medicaid or Medicare. 
	•	Aid to local and state governments facing deficits from the economic downturn. 
	•	Inclusive aid for all people and communities, regardless of immigration status. 
	•	Survival checks to families for the duration of the pandemic, and a fully refundable child tax credit of $3,000 to $3,600. 
In addition, I recently signed onto a letter to protect the income-eligibility requirements for survival checks that were in previous relief bills, rather than lower the amount and make it harder to be eligible.

VACCINES FOR VETERANS
On Feb. 9, the Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center began administering COVID-19 vaccines at community outpatient clinics in Myrtle Beach and Beaufort, SC. Enrolled Veterans are being contacted directly for vaccine appointments at these clinics. At this time, Veterans do not need to call to schedule. Veterans ages 70-years-old and older are being scheduled in accordance with CDC and VHA guidelines based on age and existing health conditions. As the supply of COVID-19 vaccines increases, clinics will expand eligibility criteria for vaccination.
The VA Medical Center will be operating the COVID-19 vaccine clinic at the new North Charleston VA Outpatient Clinic, located at 6450 Rivers Ave., on Wednesday and Friday from 8 a.m. until 12 p.m. Veterans ages 70-years-old and older can call 843-789-6900 to schedule a vaccine appointment at the North Charleston Clinic.
For Veterans who are not currently enrolled in the VA, please call the eligibility office at 843-789-7008 or visit the eligibility website https://www.charleston.va.gov/patients/eligibility.asp
More information on COVID-19 is available at:

Dear Lindsey,
I’m reaching out to you today to discuss getting vaccinated for COVID-19 in Arizona.
Currently, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines for distribution under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
Other vaccine candidates, including those from AstraZeneca, Johnson & Johnson, and Novavax are expected to seek an EUA in early 2021 as well.
Due to the limited, initial supply of vaccine, Arizona counties will be utilizing a vaccine prioritization phased approach. In order to be vaccinated, you will need to be a member of the current phase, schedule an appointment, and provide appropriate identification once you arrive at the vaccination site. Each county in Arizona has its own individual supply of the vaccine and has set its own eligibility requirements. 
You can view a map of Arizona vaccine distribution sites, HERE, and register for a COVID-19 Vaccination appointment in Arizona, HERE. 
For a step-by-step video guide to registering for a vaccine appointment through AZDHS, click HERE. For technical support with the Arizona Department of Health Services’ vaccine portal, call (602) 542-1000 and, for general information, call the Arizona COVID-19 hotline at 1-(844) 541-8201.
Sign up for your county's alert system to receive updates on COVID-19 vaccines and more by clicking the appropriate link below.

For more information, visit my Vaccines webpage, HERE.
I know our state has had a fair share of issues in this vaccine rollout, but I want to assure you that I am fighting for you and your family every step of the way. My colleagues and I recently demanded an additional 300,000 doses for Arizona from the Biden Administration and today I sent a letter to Governor Doug Ducey urging him to prioritize vaccine distribution in overlooked rural and underserved areas--many of our beloved First District cities, towns, and tribal communities.
As always, my staff and I are here to assist you. There are Arizona-specific COVID-19 resources, information, and updates, as well as information about how you can get in touch with a caseworker on my team, available to you on my website, here.
Together, as Americans, we will get through this.

2/16/21 15:38,STARTING THIS WEEK: Special Enrollment Period for Health Care,"￼  
Dear Friend,
This pandemic has made it even clearer that every American -- regardless of the color of their skin, their zip code, or their income -- needs and deserves quality, affordable health care. That’s why I’m pleased that President Biden took swift action to open a special enrollment period for Americans to sign up for health care coverage through HealthCare.gov.   That means you have from now until May 15, 2021 to sign up and get covered. To get started, you can visit HealthCare.gov or CuidadoDeSalud.gov to view 2021 plans and prices and enroll in the best one for you. You can also call the Marketplace Call Center at 1-800-318-2596, which provides assistance in over 150 languages. TTY users should call 1-855-889-4325. And don’t forget that you can get help with any step of the process here: https://localhelp.healthcare.gov.   The past 12 months have been especially difficult on a lot of Oregonians’ finances, so even if you think you may not be able to afford coverage right now, I encourage you to take a look at the options available through the exchange during this special open enrollment period. You may even quality for free coverage through the Oregon Health Plan if your income has dropped significantly this past year, and there are also other forms of financial assistance that could help you access coverage.   Health care is a basic human right, and it shouldn’t be reserved just for the powerful and privileged. I hope you’ll join me in spreading the word so we can get all of our communities signed up for care during this difficult time.   All my best,  Jeff

Weekly Newsletter: February 16, 2021
 
 

Severe Winter Weather Resources

As temperatures remain low and power outages continue in Texas, my office is in communication with local officials. We're working to help in any way we can. Please reach out if we can be of assistance to you, answer questions, or facilitate information. You can find contact information at the end of this email. 

Since yesterday, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has ordered utility providers across the state—including American Electric Power (AEP)—to begin shedding electricity, and they don’t know when the grid will stabilize. In total, 34,000 megawatts (MW) has been forced off the system since early Monday. Yesterday, ERCOT announced that it was working to restore 2,500 MW of power—serving 500,000 households. 

The ice storm caused a drastic demand in electricity. This demand combined with adverse weather created a strain on the electric grid and caused equipment failures across normal electricity generating sources (i.e. natural gas pipelines freezing up, turbines being frozen, etc.). ERCOT has said that some of the issues with power generation have been rectified so some power should be restored today and tomorrow, hopefully decreasing the number of outages. For instance, South Texas Project (STP) has said that they are trying to get back online this evening. Once AEP receives orders from ERCOT, it will begin restoring power. 

In addition, Governor Abbott issued a disaster declaration in all 254 counties, deployed resources throughout the state, and ordered the Texas State Operations Center to expand its daily operations to 24-hours a day. The White House has issued a Federal Emergency Declaration for Texas in response to the severe winter weather throughout the state. 

Resources and Information:
	•	Be aware of any sources that ask you to text your private account number to them in order to restore power. This is a scam according to ERCOT. 
	•	Call (800) 525-5555 for roadside assistance if you become stranded on the road. You can find road condition updates at DriveTexas.org. 
	•	Follow FEMA Federal Emergency Management Agency for other updates. 
	•	Monitor U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) for winter weather watches, warnings and advisories, and listen to the instructions of your local officials. 
	•	If you have power, keep your usage low and if you don’t, unplug all major appliances until you get it.
	•	You can also keep warm by closing the blinds and curtains, stuffing towels or rags in cracks under doors to prevent the loss of heat, and bundling up. 
	•	Keep indoor space heaters at least three feet from other items.
	•	Place generators outdoors and away from windows, keep them dry and properly grounded, and never plug them into a wall outlet or main electrical panel.
	•	A boil water notice is currently in effect for Nueces County.

Seeking Applicants for the Gold Star Family Fellowship Program
 
 
 
 
To give one’s life in service to our country is the greatest sacrifice an American can make. As a nation, we will never fully be able to show our gratitude to these men and women and the families they leave behind. We owe our Gold Star Families a debt that can never be repaid. 

Congress has identified a new way to serve these families and express our thanks through the creation of the Gold Star Family Fellowship program. This year-long paid fellowship was created recently as a way of giving back to those directly affected by the loss of a servicemember. 

﻿We are looking for an individual to take part in this career opportunity. 
If you are a Gold Star Family member, have a high school diploma or higher, and are interested in expanding your career, I would encourage you to apply. We are filling the position in either my Corpus Christi or Victoria office. 

As issues are debated and legislation is weighed in Washington, this program is one way Congress is recognizing the voices of Gold Star Families. It is our goal to help and in a small way say thank you.

Urging the Biden Administration to Secure the Southern Border
 
 
 
 
On Wednesday, Corpus Christi Border Patrol Station agents arrested a MS-13 gang member who was here illegally in Refugio. In addition to being a gang member, the subject has criminal convictions for carrying a concealed weapon, trespassing, and was previously ordered removed from the country in 2005.

Our Border Patrol agents continue to safeguard our communities and the entire nation. But the spread of the coronavirus and President Biden's harmful border security policies have not deterred cartel activity and migrants from crossing our borders. 

I sent a letter to President Biden today urging him to reverse his decision on banning deportations, restart construction of the border wall, and keep the successful Migrant Protection Protocols, all of which deter mass migration and mitigate cartel profits. We must do everything we can to prevent another surge at the southern border like our country experienced in summer 2019.
 

Meeting with Caldwell County Leadership
 
 
 
 
I had the pleasure of eating BBQ in Lockhart and hearing the many great projects that are in the works for Caldwell County. Seated squarely in the innovation belt, Caldwell County is producing many innovative projects. These range from artificial intelligence to agriculture to construction and many more. The opportunities in Caldwell County are endless with the resources and leadership available. 

Infrastructure is key to the development of our nation and the success of our communities. I’m constantly make an effort to ensure communication between our counties and the federal government to ensure they have the resources they need to succeed.
 

In Other News:

	•	The Texas Agriculture Task Force in the U.S. Congress recently named me a leader and co-chair. The Task Force promotes and champions federal policies that strengthen Texas agriculture and rural communities and engages producer groups and other key stakeholders in the state. In this new Congress, the group will also develop pro-agriculture strategies in trade, taxation, rural development, environmental regulation, rural broadband and the 2023 Farm Bill, advocate to the USDA, EPA and other agencies within the Biden Administration, and work closely with other members of Congress and the top Republican of the House Agriculture Committee Rep. G.T. Thompson. I look forward to representing farmers and ranchers from our part of Texas on this important Task Force. Our collective goals include standing up for the interests of the Texas agriculture community in Congress, boosting the voice of rural Texas in policy development, and securing innovative solutions for Texas producers. 
 



God Bless,

2/16/21 16:00,#GetCovered,"￼

Dear Neighbor,
 
As we continue to do all we can to keep our neighbors and loved ones safe and healthy, I want to take a moment to make sure you’re aware that it’s not too late to enroll in health coverage if you need it. 
 
President Biden has opened a special enrollment period on www.HealthCare.gov from February 15, 2021 - May 15, 2021, so that Americans trying to navigate this pandemic without insurance can log on and get covered. If you need coverage, I encourage you to visit HealthCare.gov, or click the button below, and find the plan that works best for you
  
  
CLICK HERE TO GET COVERED
  
  
COVID-19 has stolen the lives of more than 480,000 Americans and has infected 1 out of every 12. Many who recover are left with long-term health complications that will require care well into the future, even as they grapple with the lingering medical and financial consequences of the initial illness. Simply put, there has never been a more important time for us to ensure that every single American who needs coverage can get it.
 
That’s why Congress must take swift action on President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, which would take big steps to build on the Affordable Care Act, lower health costs, and expand access to care for all Americans, including those who have lost their jobs. In addition to increasing federal subsidies and lowering premiums, the plan incentivizes states to expand coverage to an additional four million people with low incomes, and provides states the opportunity to extend coverage for a year to low-income women who have recently given birth. Critically, the plan will also ramp up testing, tracing, and our national vaccination program so we can finally defeat this virus and get Americans back on their feet.
 
Please visit HealthCare.gov to enroll in coverage if you need it, and be sure to encourage your friends and family to do the same. We will get through these difficult times, but only if we continue to take care of each other. 
 
Be sure to visit the COVID-19 page on my website for more information and resources. If you have any questions or concerns, or if you need assistance, please don't hesitate to call us at (703) 256-3071.
  
Sincerely,
￼

SAFE & EFFECTIVE VACCINE DEPLOYMENT
￼
I’m fully confident the vaccines approved by the FDA are safe and effective, and they are the key to our nation’s recovery. I will continue working with federal, state, and local officials to ensure vaccine doses are distributed in our communities as efficiently as possible so that together we can defeat this invisible enemy.
Indiana is implementing a phased plan to administer FDA-approved vaccines, starting with frontline health care workers, residents and staff of long-term care facilities, and now all Hoosiers aged 65 or older.
To register and to find the nearest vaccination clinic:  Call 2-1-1 or visit OurShot.in.gov.
The state has opened hundreds of vaccination sites with at least one in every country. So far 828,078 Hoosiers have received their first dose, and 347,508 have been fully vaccinated. Vaccines administered by the state are free to all Indiana residents, but insurance may be charged an administrative fee.
The second dose will be scheduled at the clinic when the first dose is administered. A caregiver or loved one also may make an appointment on behalf of an eligible senior.
VACCINES FOR VETERANS
Attention Hoosier veterans – the St. Joseph County VA Clinic will be providing free COVID-19 vaccinations to veterans by appointment only. Appointments can be made in-person at the clinic starting Tuesday, February 16th through Friday, February 19th.
REMINDER for veterans who have scheduled an appointment – the clinic is providing vaccinations THIS SATURDAY, February 20th, between 8:00am to 3:30pm ET, at 1540 Trinity Place in Mishawaka.
For more information about COVID-19 vaccines administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, click here.

￼
Dear Fellow Utahn,
 
Welcome to my first e-newsletter! These newsletters will fill you in on what I’m up to each week, from committee work to constituent meetings. These last several weeks have been a whirlwind, but I’m settling in and working hard on your behalf.
 
Shortly after I was sworn in to the 117th Congress, the United States Capitol experienced an assault on our democratic process as we met to certify the results of the presidential election. I was deeply troubled and saddened by what took place on January 6th. It’s been a difficult season for our nation, and I want to thank the members of the Utah National Guard who came to Washington to ensure a peaceful transfer of power on January 20th.  
￼
￼
￼
￼
Last week, we drove out to the Uinta Basin to meet with regional leaders and tour the Ashley Springs water treatment facility. It was great to see the local government operating the Basin’s water supply after the Department of the Interior transferred the land in 2020. 
 
I also drove up to Logan to meet with the Bear River Association of Governments led by Executive Director Roger Jones, along with Cache County Executive David Zook. I visited with Utah State University President Noelle Cockett and Vice President for Academic and Instructional Services Robert Wagner and heard how they are helping students excel in the midst of the pandemic. I had the chance to learn more about USU’s impressive programs, including the Center for Anticipatory Intelligence, the Electrified Transportation Center, and the Space Dynamics Lab. Go Aggies!  
￼
￼
￼
￼
I stopped by Autonomous Solutions, Inc. to talk to Founder and CEO Mel Torrie about their efforts to advance technologies that contribute to driverless vehicle automation systems. I also visited the team from Neighborhood Housing Solutions, led by Executive Director Josh Runhaar. They’re doing amazing work providing affordable housing to low-income families across the First District with funding from HUD and USDA.  
 
The pandemic is allowing me to connect with many Utah organizations via Zoom, and a highlight this week was my virtual meeting with Utah’s Habitat for Humanity to hear about their legislative priorities. Keep up the great work! 
 
We are so grateful to be engaging with the incredible work happening across the First District. Please reach out to my office if you need help navigating a federal agency or if your group needs to schedule a meeting. It is an honor to serve you, and I look forward to updating you next week!

2/16/21 17:23,Join Us for a Conversation with Black Leaders,"
￼
 
Dear Friend,  
As we continue to observe Black History Month this February, I would like to invite you to join a virtual conversation with Black leaders in Central Florida next Monday, Feb. 22 at 7 p.m. This event seeks to elevate local Black voices and listen to the issues facing the Black community in our area. In the course of this discussion, we’ll aim to dissect some of the most urgent issues affecting the Black community, from the COVID-19 pandemic, to social justice, to jobs and housing, and more.
I will facilitate the panel on Facebook Live, which will include the following speakers:
	•	Dr. Karenna Senors, Chief Medical Officer of True Health
	•	Pastor Octavius Smith, Senior Pastor of Allen Chapel A.M.E. Church
	•	Emory Green, Lead Volunteer of Midway Coalition, Inc.
	•	Dr. Barbara Jenkins, Superintendent of Orange County Public Schools
I know that our community continues to feel the impact of this pandemic in different ways, which is why I am hosting this panel to discuss disparities within communities of color, and the best way we can move forward together. I encourage all those in Florida’s Seventh Congressional District, which includes all of Seminole County and most of northern Orange County, to join us. This panel will be held on Facebook Live on Mon., Feb. 22 at 7:00 p.m. Follow my page on Facebook to get an invitation and reminders about the event.
I look forward to listening to these Central Florida leaders and having these important conversations to help us better understand what we can all do to help everyone in our community.
Sincerely,

￼

It's Time to Drain the Swamp.﻿
￼
￼
￼

Friend, 
 
Washington is broken. One of the main reasons why is because members of the DC swamp have more incentive to serve special interests than their constituents. Until we fix this corrupt incentive structure, the jerseys may change, but the results will stay the same. 

That's why I introduced common-sense reforms that would help drain the swamp and make our government function the way our Founders intended it to. These bills would dramatically upend ""business-as-usual"" in Washington by: 

	•	Forcing Congress to pass a balanced budget, 
	•	Establishing a five-year lobbying ban on members of Congress and high-ranking staff, 
	•	Terminating tax-payer funded pensions, and
	•	Codifying President Trump's 2017 Ethics Pledge into law. 

I discussed these ideas at length last week with Jay Weber on WISN Radio, but the purpose is clear: we need to make sure members of Congress need to serve the people, not the swamp. 

Our time in Washington should be viewed as a deployment, not a career. And while there's more to be done (like imposing term limits on members of the House and Senate), these bills are an important first step towards making serving in Congress about just that: service. 

Semper Fi,
￼

P.S. Check out the Washington Examiner article for more information on my efforts to drain the swamp.

2/16/21 18:18,Working Across the Aisle on COVID Relief,"A message from US Senator Todd Young
￼ 


My Statement on the Impeachment Trial
I remain troubled and saddened by the events leading up to and on the day of the Capitol riots. However, it is improper under the present circumstances for the former president of the United States to be subject to an impeachment trial.  Simply put, the U.S. House of Representatives conducted a rushed and incomplete process for this snap impeachment. In its haste to impeach the former president, the House declined to engage in any fact-finding, investigation, hearing, or testimony before adopting the article of impeachment. Therefore, the former president and his counsel were denied the opportunity to review and test the integrity of the evidence offered against him.  As I warned after the last impeachment, the House majority’s rigged process is creating a dangerous new precedent to weaponize impeachment, a precedent that is increasingly likely to lead to serial impeachments in a polarized America.   Our nation is facing a crisis. It’s time to put this improper impeachment trial behind us and focus on the issues that matter most to the country — bipartisan efforts to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and restore the health of our economy.
Working Across the Aisle to Get Targeted Coronavirus Relief to Hoosiers 
I have long believed in the importance of working across the aisle to get things done. I recently visited President Biden with a group of nine of my colleagues to present a more targeted COVID relief proposal. With so many Hoosiers suffering due to the adverse impacts of this public health crisis, it is critical that we in Congress work together to get this done.    Learn more in an editorial by the Indianapolis Business Journal. 
Supporting Mental Health and Addiction Services During the Pandemic
This pandemic has been hard on Americans. Now more than ever, we must prioritize mental health by dedicating resources like telehealth, support groups, and outreach services so people can get the help that they need. I introduced the bipartisan Coronavirus Mental Health and Addiction Assistance Act to provide mental health and addiction services and treatment to Hoosiers struggling at home.  The Coronavirus Mental Health and Addiction Assistance Act would include an emergency authorization of $100 million to initiate or expand programs offering mental health and substance use disorder services in response to the pandemic, including support groups, telephone helplines and websites, training programs, telehealth services, and outreach services. 
Protecting Americans With Pre-Existing Conditions    
Last week, I reintroduced the Protect Act to ensure that Americans will never be denied health care coverage or be charged more because of a pre-existing condition.  When it comes to healthcare, there is bipartisan agreement that we must protect people with pre-existing conditions. Families should never have to worry about being denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition, and our legislation will ensure they are protected.  Learn more about this bill through WANE’s coverage here. 
Constituent Spotlight
Members of my team are working around the clock to ensure that the federal government is properly and effectively serving Hoosiers. In one week, we helped return nearly $75,000 to the hands of constituents who were not receiving the Social Security benefits they deserve.  If you or someone you know are experiencing issues with Social Security, click here to contact my office.

Sincerely, ￼ Mark DeSaulnier Member of Congress 
COMMITTEE ACTION 
Last week, the House was hard at work finalizing the coronavirus relief package through a long series of committee hearings. In total, Congressman DeSaulnier spent over 31 hours over three days debating the bill and successfully fighting back against attempts to weaken the relief package and delay support to American families. 
Supporting the Minimum Wage
In the House Committee on Education and Labor, one of the Congressman's top priorities is helping workers across the country earn a livable wage like California has done. As a former small business owner and a longtime labor advocate, Congressman DeSaulnier fought back against claims that raising the federal minimum wage would be detrimental for our workers and business owners. To hear more about how this measure would benefit workers and our entire economy, click here or on the image below. 
￼ 
IN THE NEWS
Congressman DeSaulnier joined Phil Matier and Liz Kreutz of ABC7 to discuss the impeachment trial, Senate Republicans' shameful acquittal of ex-President Trump, and what comes next as House Democrats continue their efforts to get coronavirus relief to the American people.

BROADBAND 
Take a Speed Test Here. 
The sad fact is that many places in West Virginia simply do not have access to reliable broadband and the lack of access affects West Virginians every day. Back in 2015, the FCC released a coverage map that stated 99.9% of Americans had wireless coverage. I knew then what I know now: That is just plain wrong. 
HOW MAY WE HELP YOU? 
To request assistance from my case team, click here.  As your U.S. Senator, I am proud to be your voice with government agencies during your time of need. My goal is for me and my staff to provide the best possible customer service for every West Virginian who contacts me needing assistance. While I have no direct jurisdiction in legal or administrative matters of any federal, state, or local agency, I welcome the opportunity to assist you in any way possible and to assure that full consideration is given to your case. See one of our success stories below: 
  
Mr. Jonathan Carr, of Princeton contacted the Senator for assistance with his appeal for service connected benefits. As a result of Caseworker Kim Berry’s inquiry, John’s appeal was granted, resulting in a retroactive payment.

MANCHIN ENCOURAGES WEST VIRGINIANS TO APPLY FOR HEALTH INSURANCE DURING ACA OPEN ENROLLMENT PERIOD   West Virginians interested in applying can learn more at acanavigator.com/wv/home or call at 1-844-WV-CARES.   Charleston, WV – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) urged West Virginians to apply for health insurance coverage during the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Special Enrollment Period, which ends May 15, 2021.  ""Every West Virginian deserves to have access to affordable, reliable healthcare – especially during the COVID-19 pandemic that has taken the lives of more than 2,200 West Virginians and 470,000 Americans,” said Senator Manchin. “Over 180,000 West Virginians currently rely on the ACA for healthcare coverage and many more West Virginians lost their coverage due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I am pleased the Biden Administration has opened a Special Enrollment Period to allow uninsured Americans and West Virginians to apply for healthcare coverage until May 15, 2021. To apply and enroll, please visit healthcare.gov to find a plan that works for you and your family."" 
MANCHIN STATEMENT ON IMPEACHMENT VOTE  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) released the following statement on his guilty vote on the articles of impeachment brought against President Donald Trump for inciting an insurrection at the United States Capitol on January 6th, 2021.  ""Today I voted guilty on the articles of impeachment brought against former President Trump to hold him accountable for his seditious actions and words that threatened our democracy. It is time to move forward as one nation to focus on helping Americans suffering from the pandemic. Now more than ever, it is on each of us to seek unity over division and put partisanship aside for the good of our country.”

WORKING FOR YOU
MANCHIN ANNOUNCES TWO WEST VIRGINIA HEALTH CENTER SYSTEMS TO RECEIVE COVID-19 VACCINE ALLOCATION SOON, STATE RECEIVING ANOTHER WEEKLY DOSE INCREASE   Charleston, WV – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) announced that two West Virginia health center systems, Valley Health Systems and Shenandoah Valley Medical System, will soon be receiving direct COVID-19 vaccine dose shipments through the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) COVID-19 Vaccination Program. COVID-19 vaccines provided to community health centers under this program are separate from the state’s weekly allocation, and will increase the overall vaccine supply in the state. Senator Manchin also received notification that West Virginia will receive a 7,000 dose increase in the Pfizer vaccine weekly allocation, the 4th weekly allocation increase in a row for the state.   “Today I received notification that two West Virginia health center systems will soon be receiving direct shipments of COVID-19 vaccine doses to administer to West Virginians. West Virginia continues to lead the nation in vaccination efforts and our health centers have been integral to the distribution program. The HRSA COVID-19 Vaccination Program is aimed at ensuring equitable vaccine distribution across the state and our health centers, who serve roughly 27 percent of West Virginians, are well equipped to do just that. Vaccines are essential to defeating this horrible virus and I am incredibly pleased that our health centers have been chosen to receive doses directly. I am also pleased West Virginia will be receiving another weekly vaccine allocation increase from Pfizer, increasing the state’s ability to vaccinate more West Virginians. As vaccine production continues to increase, I will continue to work with the Biden Administration to quickly procure enough doses for every West Virginian who wants to be vaccinated,” said Senator Manchin.

2/16/21 18:40,Partisan Stimulus Process,"
￼ 
Partisan Stimulus Process
Dear Friend, 

Last week, the House Ways and Means Committee held a series of mark-up hearings to discuss President Biden’s new $1.9 trillion so-called stimulus package. Between House Democrats’ use of reconciliation and their actions during the mark-up process, it’s clear that they are not interested in compromise or bipartisanship. 

My Republican colleagues offered several commonsense amendments to better support small businesses, fight against unemployment fraud, bring transparency to nursing homes, and help workers re-enter the workforce – but Democrats rejected these proposals. They even unanimously objected to a measure that would use a science-based approach to getting children back in schools. 

During the hearing on Wednesday, I spoke in support of Ranking Member Kevin Brady’s (R-TX) amendment to ensure that no one gets paid more on unemployment than by working. Unfortunately, Democrats blocked it. Click here to watch my committee remarks.

￼

I also discussed Representative Kevin Hern’s (R-OK) amendment to incrementally phase out bonus employment benefits. While this shouldn’t be a controversial issue, every single Democrat voted against this amendment. Click here to watch my remarks.

￼

On Thursday, I advocated for the passage of Representative Tom Reed’s (R-NY) amendment to promote accountability by requiring governors who receive federal support to report accurate data on nursing homes. This amendment is badly needed in light of Governor Cuomo's disastrous nursing home edicts and efforts to hide the truth. It shouldn’t take months of fighting, a court order from the New York Attorney General, and intense media scrutiny for this important information to become known. Click here to watch my remarks.

￼

Furthermore, much of this “COVID-19 relief"" package includes provisions entirely unrelated to the coronavirus, including an attempt to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. This has nothing to do with the pandemic. In fact, this wage mandate has been a Leftist priority that Democrats – led by Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described “Socialist” – have been trying to push since before COVID-19 was even in our vocabulary. 

They consistently try to impose one-size-fits-all policies across the country regardless of what the impact might be and how needs in New York might be different from those in Georgia. Blanket mandates are conceptually a flawed strategy, and at a time when so many businesses are struggling and people are out of work, the consequences of such an extreme hike in the minimum wage would be even more severe. 

The reality is, many small businesses – particularly in regions with lower costs of living – would be unable to afford a $15 minimum wage, especially as they struggle to recover from severe lockdowns and the devastating economic impacts of the pandemic. Many Main Street shops, stores, and restaurants would simply go out of business – while others will be forced to lay off workers. Furthermore, the CBO predicts the $15 wage would fuel inflation, slow overall economic growth, raise the national deficit by $54 billion, and destroy 1.4 million jobs. 

This job-killing proposal is simply not the right way forward. We should be focused on pro-growth policies, not advancing the extreme Left’s agenda. Before the pandemic hit, our nation witnessed historically low unemployment, growing wages, and record job creation. How was this done? Not through heavy-handed mandates. With targeted deregulation and smart economic policies, American families and businesses benefit. 

As I mentioned last week, it is worth noting again that more than a trillion dollars from previous bipartisan COVID-19 relief bills has yet to be spent. Remaining funds include billions for important priorities like testing, PPP funding to support small businesses, vaccine rollout, schools reopening, and more.  

We want to get Americans working, small businesses operating, and children around the country back at school (and for more than one day a week). The Democrats’ partisan proposal is certainly not targeted to those priorities. 

Closing the Digital Divide
￼
In case you missed it, I recently wrote an op-ed for the Newnan Times-Herald highlighting an exciting rural broadband announcement in Georgia Third’s Congressional District! 
Access to high-speed internet is critical for our 21st century economy, and I’m thrilled Central Georgia EMC and Southern Rivers Energy are partnering with Conexon to bridge the digital divide for 80,000 homes in 18 counties across middle Georgia.
Click here to read the full piece.

Good News for Vaccines
I’m pleased to announce that CVS Pharmacies are now offering vaccine appointments at 12 stores across Georgia. If you feel that receiving the vaccine is the right choice for you and your family, you can make an appointment through the CVS Pharmacy website here. 
I’m also happy to share that the Georgia Department of Public Health has launched a new COVID-19 vaccine dashboard to provide a detailed picture of the vaccination administration in Georgia. The dashboard includes statewide and county specific numbers. Information includes the number of vaccine doses administered, shipped to Georgia, and received by Georgia providers as well as more details on the Georgia vaccination progress. The dashboard updates daily at 3pm. Click here to learn more about the dashboard.

Follow the Science, Reopen the Schools
As a father and member of the medical community, our students’ and educators’ well-being is a personal concern of mine. Last week, I joined my House Doctors Caucus colleagues in sending a letter to President Biden urging his administration to work with all Governors to take the necessary and reasonable safety measures to resume in-person learning. 
Education is the key to opening a world of opportunity for America’s younger generations, and we cannot risk the welfare and futures of our youth by keeping schools closed. New research from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) shows that in-person education does not pose a significant risk of spreading COVID-19 and can be carried out safely as long as mask-wearing and social distancing are maintained. 

Furthermore, the Director of the CDC, Zeke Miller - who was appointed by President Biden - said last week that vaccinating all teachers is not a prerequisite for safely reopening schools. It is vital that we follow the science and safely get our children back in the classroom – soon.

My Message on Impeachment
In last week’s impeachment trial, our country relived the chilling and un-American assault on the foundations of our democracy. New video footage reinforced both the brutality of the rioters and also the heroism of members of law enforcement who, just barely, prevented further loss of life. The personal threat of that day, however, is not nearly as troubling as the threat to our democracy.   After listening to the arguments from the House Managers and former President Trump’s defense, I voted in favor of convicting Trump. As dangerous as Donald Trump’s actions were over the course of the months, days, and hours leading up to the violent insurrection, my vote was less about holding Trump as an individual accountable than it was about protecting our country from similar threats in the future – at his hands or at the hands of others.   Impeachment is not designed to punish – it was included in our Constitution to protect the Republic from abuses of power and tyranny. I voted to protect the America that we know and love – because January 6, 2021 will be our future if we tolerate what the impeachment trial showed, which was Trump’s concerted campaign to prevent the peaceful transition of power.  Of all the things former President Trump did, it is actually what he did not do once he knew the Capitol was being attacked, and his own Vice President – among others – was being threatened, that was most troubling. Should there be any doubt that Trump intended to disrupt the certification of votes and encourage the violence that desecrated the Capitol, his decision to allow it to continue for hours should dispel that uncertainty. If he had not intended the violence when it began, his failure to exercise his power to secure the Capitol and protect those inside was itself a violation of his oath of office and merits conviction and disqualification from holding future office.   Before Trump’s refusal to engage in the peaceful transfer of power, the public could gather outside the Capitol – families could play soccer on the weekends and tourists could take photos of this temple of democracy. Before COVID, the public could even walk right in, after being properly screened. But during the impeachment trial, I came to work through fences and barbed wire. There was no open space for the public because we have lost the common understanding that the Capitol is a place where we spar with words, not physical violence.  It is fitting that this past Monday, we marked the birthday of George Washington, who helped establish some of the bedrock principles of our democracy not simply through his service as our first President, but by voluntarily surrendering the office, peacefully. Our union that Washington helped birth – and that Lincoln managed to preserve – is still fragile, and it cannot be taken for granted.  We will need to continue the work of investigating what led to the grim events of January 6 as well as what happened on that day, and we will need to take steps to make clear that acts of tyranny will not be tolerated in our country.   We have considerable work ahead to bring our country together and strive for greater opportunity for all, both in the face of this pandemic and beyond. I am committed to continuing that work and showing the American people – and the world – that we are resilient, strong, and willing to renew our commitment to government of, for, and by the people. 
With every good wish,  ￼   Senator Maggie Hassan

Kansas Common Sense  February 16, 2021
Hello,  Welcome to “Kansas Common Sense.” Thanks for your continued interest in receiving my weekly newsletter. Please feel free to forward it on to your family and friends if it would interest them. 
  
Concluding the Senate Impeachment Trial 
The violence at the United States Capitol on January 6 was an attempt to subvert democracy, and I condemn it in the strongest possible terms. Rioters and extremists sought to prevent Members of Congress and Vice President Pence from performing their constitutional obligation to affirm the results of an election, and President Trump was wrong to continue to spread allegations of widespread fraud and not immediately discourage the reprehensible and unpatriotic behavior.  The Constitution does not clearly state whether a former president can be tried for impeachment by the Senate, but I believe the impeachment process is intended to be used for considering whether or not “The President” should be removed from office. Because former President Trump is no longer in office, I voted to acquit. Establishing the precedent that the Senate has jurisdiction to convict a former president would cause extreme damage to our country and the future of the presidency. 
  
Celebrating Black History 
February is a month to reflect on Black history, to both understand its struggle throughout American history and celebrate the lives and contributions of Black Americans. This past week, I’ve introduced two pieces of legislation that aim to highlight, uplift and preserve our collective knowledge of Black history.  Expanding the Brown v. Board of Education Sites  This week, I joined my Senate colleagues in introducing legislation to honor and commemorate the historic sites that contributed to the 1954 landmark Supreme Court decision, Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka.  As one of the cornerstones of the civil rights movement, Kansan Linda Brown and her parents took their case all the way to the Supreme Court, leading to the unanimous overturning of the “separate but equal” doctrine which was established in 1896’s Plessy v. Ferguson that discriminated against school children because of their skin color. This legislation will expand and preserve the historic sites in Kansas and around the country connected to this case. Kansas has played a key role in the civil rights movement, and we must seek to preserve this legacy that calls on all Americans to uphold the self-evident truth that all men and women are created equal.
  
Honoring the Women of the “Six-Triple-Eight""  Additionally, I introduced legislation to honor the brave women of the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion. Seventy-six years ago, the women of “Six-Triple-Eight,” the only all-female, all-black battalion to serve overseas during World War II, arrived in the European Theater of Operations on February 12th, 1945. Upon arrival, they were faced with warehouses full of millions of pieces of backlogged mail. This unit did the essential work of sorting and directing mail for the 7 million Americans that worked or served in Europe during the war. They cleared that backlog in just three months, making certain that troop morale remained high at a pivotal point in the war, so that troops on the front lines were able to receive mail from home, strengthening their resolve to remain in the fight.  I have had the opportunity to recognize the brave service and sacrifice of these women on multiple occasions in the past, and it is my honor to advocate for this final award. In 2018, I helped lead the effort to place a monument commemorating the women of the Six-Triple-Eight in Buffalo Soldier Memorial Park at Fort Leavenworth (pictured below). I then championed an effort to award the unit the Army Meritorious Unit Commendation: this was the first unit award the 6888 ever received and was well overdue.  Their contributions to the war effort cannot be overstated and my “Six-Triple-Eight” Congressional Gold Medal Act further recognizes their tremendous service and sacrifice. 
  
￼
  
Remembering Ike this President’s Day 
On President’s Day, we recognize the contributions our American presidents have made to our freedom and to the greatness of our nation. Yesterday, I was thinking of Abilene native, President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Ike, a five-star general in the United States Army and the Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in Europe, represents the best of our country. His name, adorned on schools, memorials and hospitals across our nation and abroad, lives in our memory, and we are inspired by his selfless service and sacrifice to our nation. 
  
I encourage all Kansans to visit Abilene’s Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library & Museum (pictured below) to learn more about the incredible life and legacy of Kansas’ favorite son.

Combatting Global Hunger 
Joining CARE’s U.S. Leadership Forum  This week, I joined CARE’s Global Hunger and U.S. Leadership Forum to discuss the impact of COVID-19 on global food systems. This forum highlighted opportunities where Americans can work to meet the challenge of ending global hunger. I believe that fighting hunger is not only the morally right thing to do, it is also the smart thing to do.  International food aid programs provide a valuable market for Kansas agricultural producers, as well as strengthen America’s national security by promoting greater stability in the world. As a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and co-chair of the Senate Hunger Caucus, I work to prioritize funding for our international food aid programs, including Food for Peace and Dole-McGovern Food for Education. The Food for Peace law was signed into law by President Eisenhower and Dole-McGovern was established by Senator Dole, and I am proud to carry on the strong Kansas tradition of fighting against global hunger.  
  
Urging Replenishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development  As co-chair of the Senate Hunger Caucus, I led a group of senators this week in urging Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to pledge support from the United States for the 12th replenishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) to help reduce global hunger. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated global food insecurity and poverty, which had been made worse in recent years due to widespread incidences of conflict and economic disruption. In order for the United States to continue to demonstrate strong leadership, I urged Secretary Yellen to make a robust pledge to IFAD at the pledging conference on February 16, 2021. Taking such action will benefit and enable the world’s most vulnerable populations to generate more income and improve nutrition and food security. 
  
Billions of Dollars in COVID-19 Relief Still Left to be Spent 
Last year, Congress spent $4 trillion on bipartisan COVID-19 relief packages to support Americans as our country faced the challenges of this pandemic. The latest COVID-19 relief package provided $900 billion in additional resources and was signed into law on December 27, 2020. Much of that assistance is only now being disbursed.  Federal funds that remain unspent as of late January include $14 billion for COVID-19 testing, $11 billion for the Department of Veteran Affairs, $64 billion for K-12 schools and over $200 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Before authorizing additional funding, Congress must make certain these existing resources are being used efficiently to combat the ongoing effects of this pandemic. 
  
Discussing Rural Health Care with Kansas Medical Students 
This week, I met virtually with a group of Kansas medical students who want to serve rural communities after completing their doctorate degrees.  During our meeting, we discussed COVID-19 relief for hospitals through the Provider Relief Fund and allocating 20% for rural hospitals; ensuring pharmaceutical manufacturers do not undermine the role of contract pharmacies in the 340B Drug Pricing Program; and the staffing recruitment difficulties rural hospitals continue to face, especially throughout the pandemic. Ensuring rural communities have access to quality medical care has never been more important, and I thank these students for their commitment to providing medical care in hard-to-reach places. I was pleased to see these students promise they will come back to serve Kansas communities following graduation.  Thank you to Landon Fulmer for organizing this meeting. 
  
￼ 
 
Ensuring Veterans Have Access to COVID-19 Vaccines 
As the top Republican on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I have worked with my colleagues in Congress and in the administration to make certain that veterans in Kansas have access to the best COVID-19 care possible. This included providing PPE and ventilators to health care workers and hospitals during the onset of the pandemic and has now transitioned to efficiently administering vaccines across our state. I was with the leadership of the Dole VA Medical Center in Wichita when they received their first shipment of vaccines in December, and I am encouraged that we are able to vaccinate vulnerable veterans. More than 23,000 veterans have been vaccinated between the Kansas City, Topeka, Leavenworth and Wichita VA Medical Centers and their associated Community-Based Outpatient Clinics.  Currently, veterans who have existing health risks or are over 75 years of age are eligible to receive the vaccine. The VA is reaching out to those individuals personally to notify them of their eligibility and coordinate their vaccines. If you are a veteran, you can click here for more information about the VA’s COVID-19 testing and treatment resources. You can also sign up for updates about vaccine availability here.  As ranking member of the Senate VA Committee, there is no group of individuals whom I hold in higher regard than those who served in uniform. My work in Congress will continue to ensure that veterans are able to access these vaccines. 
  
Meeting with National Sorghum Producers 
I met virtually with members of National Sorghum Producers this week to discuss a number of issues facing farmers. We discussed the negative impact the Biden administration’s proposed changes to step up basis rules and capital gains tax rates would have on family farms; the role sorghum and agriculture will play in carbon sequestration in the future; resource conservation and sustainability; and the importance of trade for the success of Kansas farms. Kansas leads the nation in sorghum production, and exporting the crops we grow to consumers around the world is vital for the success of our farmers. It was great to hear from sorghum producers both in Kansas and throughout the nation as I work to advocate on behalf of farmers and ranchers. 
  
￼ 
  
Hearing from Kansas Independent College Leaders 
This week, I was grateful for the opportunity to hear from several of our Kansas independent college presidents, including Sterling College, Tabor College, University of St. Mary, Central Christian College and Friends University. The funding provided by the CARES Act and other coronavirus relief measures passed by Congress has allowed Kansas higher education institutions to safely reopen for in-person learning.  In addition to providing a strong college experience in the midst of a pandemic, these institutions and their students are helping retain a low unemployment rate in their institutions’ towns. The educators at Kansas’ independent colleges, like the rest of our state, will benefit from an accelerated vaccine distribution process, and I remain committed to securing the necessary funding and resources to get more shots in more arms. Thank you to these leaders for your dedication to Kansas students despite the many challenges you are currently facing. 
  
Honored to Serve You in Washington  It is an honor to serve you in Washington, D.C. Thank you to the many Kansans who have been calling and writing in to share their thoughts and opinions on the issues our state and country face. I appreciate the words of Kansans, whether in the form of a form of letter, a Facebook comment or a phone call, who wish to make their voice heard.

Severe Weather Situational Update
No Certain Timeline to Restore Power
 
Neighbors,
 
As a result of severe weather and historically low temperatures, our power grid has been dealt a serious blow, with many generators going offline completely. 
 
Over the last 48 hours, millions of Texans have had little to no power in their homes. Access to clean water, cellular and internet service, and transportation are also acutely impaired. 
 
While the failures of our energy grid are unacceptable, what's even more concerning is the lack of accurate and clear communication being provided to the general public. While I have been working to get Collin County residents the answers they deserve, my confidence in the information I have been provided thus far is insufficient.
 
Ultimately, those responsible for the operation and management of our energy grid will have to answer for the glaring collapse of our energy infrastructure and inadequate communication to the public. However, at this time, my priority is to help you navigate this situation. 
 
This situation is serious and should not be taken lightly. As your Representative, my top priority is making sure my constituents have a complete understanding of current circumstances so that you may make the best decisions for you and your family. In the absence of accurate and timely information, I believe it is best to error on the side of caution.
 
With more severe weather on the way, I want to urge all those in North Texas, especially high-risk residents, who have the ability to safely travel to, and stay with, friends, family, or neighbors with power to do so. Officials warn, if you have already experienced extended power outages over the lasts 24 hours, it is likely you will continue to experience outages over the coming days. A lists of local warming centers is included at the bottom of this email, but pleases note, this information is subject to change.
 
Those preparing to leave your home should turn off water mains to help prevent future flooding. If you are fortunate to have power, please take efforts to conserve energy, but above all, check in on your neighbors - especially seniors, those with medical conditions, and families with young children. 
 
Texans are strong and we will get through this together.
 
     Semper Fi,

Rep. Weber Statement on Texas Winter Storm Blackouts
Washington, D.C. – Tuesday, February 16, 2021 U.S. Rep. Randy Weber (TX-14) issued the following statement on Texas' winter storm blackouts.   This is a painful time for Southeast Texas. After more than our fair share of hurricanes and tropical storms, we are now enduring a historic winter storm that has paralyzed our state, risked countless lives, and threatens untold property damage. 
What is happening across our state is unacceptable, and the lack of adequate preparation by ERCOT or resiliency in our power grid is inexcusable. 

We do not yet have all the answers, but I am working and will continue to work with my state and federal colleagues to get answers and formulate solutions so that nothing like this occurs again. In the meantime, I have been in contact with ERCOT, CenterPoint, and Entergy. I will continue to work with local utilities, power providers, and government officials to encourage the fastest possible restoration of power to our community.

Texans are strong, and we support one another. Please be sure to check on family, friends, and neighbors who may be without power for extended periods. If you or someone close to you is in need of a warming center, several have been established across the district and can be found at Warming Centers – TDEM (texas.gov).

Additional freezing rain and other wintery precipitation may be coming tonight and into tomorrow. With cold surface temperatures and ice, road conditions are considered dangerous. We are urging drivers to stay home. 

If you must move about, please be safe. For road conditions and closures, visit DriveTexas, but note road conditions can change suddenly.
This will be difficult, but just as we made it through Harvey, Imelda, and so many other storms, if we together and support each other, we will get through this and ensure this never happens again.  God Bless Texas

Representatives Adriano Espaillat and Don Bacon Launch 2021 National Congressional Art Competition

Members Named 2021 Co-Hosts of National Art Competition Open to High School Students Around the Nation


￼


WASHINGTON, D.C. – Today, Representatives Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) and Don Bacon (NE-02) announce details of this year’s Congressional Art Competition, a national contest open to high school students from around the nation to showcase their artistic talents with an opportunity to display their winning art in the United States Capitol for up to one year. 

Reps. Espaillat and Bacon will serve as this year’s national co-hosts to provide guidance for House Member offices, art organizations and students interested in participating. This year’s competition will be open to high school students who may submit digital renderings of their artwork to their respective congressional district offices. 

“New York is home to some of the world’s most celebrated artists and that artist talent starts early. I am proud to serve as a co-host of the 2021 Congressional Art Competition and encourage high school students from my district and from around the nation to submit their artwork for a chance to showcase their creativity and artist talents as part of this outstanding program,” said Rep. Espaillat. 

“The Congressional Art Competition is a great way for our youth to showcase their talents to the world and I am thankful to co-chair it with Rep. Espaillat,” said Rep. Bacon. “Our youth have endured much during this pandemic, including isolation, and hopefully this will provide them an outlet to connect with their communities and spread some joy. The students who compete in this should be highly commended for their dedication and perseverance.”

There is no required theme, however artwork that highlights the rich tapestry and expression of communities around the nation are encouraged. The original artwork may include digital submissions of paintings, drawings, collages, and photography. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, artwork may be submitted from the 2019 school year, the 2020 virtual school year and the current 2021 hybrid year – as many communities continue to navigate the reopening process for students and families. 

Please click here to read the complete rules and regulations for the 2021 competition for students and teachers.

Congresistas Adriano Espaillat y Don Bacon lanzan la Competencia Nacional de Arte del Congreso 2021

Los miembros fueron nombrados coanfitriones del año 2021 de la Competencia Nacional de Arte abierta a estudiantes de secundaria de toda la nación


WASHINGTON, D.C. – Hoy, los congresistas Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) y Don Bacon (NE-02) anuncian los detalles de la Competencia de Arte del Congreso de este año, un concurso nacional abierto a estudiantes de secundaria de toda la nación para mostrar sus talentos artísticos con la oportunidad de exhibir su obra ganadora en el Capitolio de los Estados Unidos hasta por un año.

Los congresistas Espaillat y Bacon serán los coanfitriones nacionales de este año para brindar orientación a las oficinas de los miembros de la Cámara, las organizaciones de arte y los estudiantes interesados en participar. La competencia de este año estará abierta a estudiantes de secundaria que pueden enviar versiones digitales de sus obras de arte a las oficinas del distrito congresual a la que pertenezcan. 

“Nueva York es el hogar de algunos de los artistas más famosos del mundo y ese talento artístico comienza temprano. Me enorgullece servir como coanfitrión de la Competencia de Arte del Congreso 2021 y alentar a los estudiantes de secundaria de mi distrito y de todo el país a enviar sus obras de arte para que tengan la oportunidad de mostrar su creatividad y talentos como parte de este programa excepcional”, dijo el Rep. Espaillat.

“El Concurso de Arte del Congreso es una excelente manera para que nuestros jóvenes muestren sus talentos al mundo y estoy agradecido de copresidirlo con el Rep. Espaillat”, dijo el Rep. Bacon. “Nuestros jóvenes han soportado mucho durante esta pandemia, incluido el aislamiento, y esperamos que este concurso les brinde una salida para conectarse con sus comunidades y difundir algo de alegría.

2/17/21 10:25,Extreme Winter Weather Update and Resources,"
￼
￼

February 17, 2021

Dear Friend,

As I’m sure you’re experiencing, Winter Storm Uri has wreaked havoc across United States, and especially the Lone Star State. Here in Irving, we have experienced snow and ice, accompanied by freezing record-low temperatures. Like many of you, I have not had power since early Monday morning and have been huddling by the fireplace and piling on extra layers to try to stay warm. 

The arctic air that poured into Texas resulted in a record-breaking demand for power, resulting in the state’s electric grid failure. Energy suppliers planned to use rolling blackouts to help decrease demand, but unfortunately the system remained overwhelmed, leading to the prolonged power outages. 

ERCOT, ONCOR, and other energy service providers are working diligently to restore power across Texas, but unfortunately, there is no anticipated timeline for power restoration.

According to the National Weather Service, a Winter Storm Warning will be in effect until 6:00am on Thursday morning. Additional precipitation – including both snow and ice – is expected, with an anticipated 2-6 inches of snow. This additional weather will result in dangerous travel conditions, additional power outages, wind chills cold enough to result in hypothermia if precautions are not taken.

I’m urging all North Texans to take extra precautions to stay safe, including avoiding travel until after 6:00am on Thursday morning.

I have compiled below a list of resources that may be helpful for you and your neighbors in this unprecedented time. If you have access to a working phone and need assistance accessing additional information, please do not hesitate to contact my office. We are ready to serve as a resource for you as we all navigate this extreme weather.

Stay safe and warm,
￼

Congresswoman Beth Van Duyne (TX-24)
￼

Guidance for High-Risk Residents

High risk individuals, such as seniors, those with certain health concerns, or families with infants, experiencing extended power outages, should make arrangements to stay with family, friends, or a neighbor who has power. Locally, shelters and warming centers are opening to the public. A list of these locations can be found at the bottom of this email.

If you or a loved one depends on electric or battery powered medical devices such as respirators, ventilators, oxygen machines, or home dialysis equipment, please contact your healthcare provider immediately. If you are experiencing a health emergency, don't take any chances and call 911 right away.

Staying Warm Without Power

	•	Wear layers of loose-fitting, lightweight, warm clothing
	•	Close blinds and curtains to retain heat
	•	Stuff towels or rags in cracks under doors
	•	Close off rooms to avoid wasting heat

Keeping Safe

	•	Delay travel plans and avoid driving
	•	Do not use a charcoal grill, stove or oven to heat your home
	•	Keep indoor space heaters several feet way from other items

2/17/21 10:55,Hello Lindsey! An update from your Congresswoman!,"
￼

Hello from your Congresswoman!

￼

I wanted to provide an update on our efforts to pass President Biden's comprehensive stimulus package. Since its introduction, we have been clear that while President Biden's plan is a good start, it must be the minimum floor – not the ceiling. 

Millions of American workers are risking their lives for poverty wages that haven’t been raised in over a decade. That's why last week, we secured two major wins in the House of Representatives’ pandemic relief package:

	1.	The inclusion of a $15 minimum wage
	2.	Stopped efforts to limit relief checks to fewer Americans

In the coming weeks, we look forward to passing a robust rescue package that meets the scale of this economic crisis so we can crush the pandemic, bring back this economy, and return people to work.

￼

￼

Planes, Trains, and Small Biz!

As part of my committee assignments, I voted to pass two major bills that invest billions in relief into our small businesses and public transportation:

Small Business Relief Bill
	•	$25B for restaurants
	•	$15B in Economic Injury Disaster Loans
	•	$7.25B for the Paycheck Protection Program
	•	$1.25B for the SBA’s grant program

Transportation and Infrastructure Relief Bill
	•	$50B for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund to help with COVID-19 response, including vaccination efforts
	•	$30B for public transit systems
	•	$8B for airports 
￼

￼

Inaugural Ticket Giveaway:

This month, our office will be distributing official Commemorative Inaugural Invitations to local constituents.

While public attendees were not permitted at this year's inauguration, we want to make sure residents have a reminder of that historic day.

If you’re interested in receiving your own historic Inaugural Invitation, make sure to request a ticket by clicking here. 

Please note that due to a limited supply, submission requests will be selected at random and only for residents of Illinois' 3rd District.
￼

￼

Hearts for Heroes:

A big thank you to the IL-03 residents who participated in our first annual Hearts for Heroes! 

﻿This weekend, I stopped by Palos Hospital, Christ Hospital, and VFW Post #5220 to drop off Valentine’s Day cards you all made for our heroic veterans and healthcare workers.
￼

Mobile Services:

My team is working tirelessly to ensure constituent services are getting to IL-03 residents while staying protected against COVID-19. That means mobile and virtual services and open phone lines to talk directly with you so we can ensure you receive the help you deserve. 

Be sure to stay connected with our District and D.C. offices! For contact information, please visit here. 
￼

Legislative Recap:

Need a recap of the work done over the past two weeks? Here are some of the important votes we've taken and bills I've cosponsored 👇

	•	Voted to approve the House Committee on Small Business' package of $50 billion in relief funds for #SmallBiz to put them on the road to recovery 
	•	Voted to approve the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure's package of $100 billion in much-needed aid for public transit and transportation workers 
	•	With the leadership of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, secured $15 minimum wage in the House relief bill 
	•	With the leadership of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, stopped a proposal that would’ve restricted survival checks based on new income thresholds 
	•	Co-sponsored Rep. Lauren Underwood's Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act of 2021 to save moms’ lives and end racial and ethnic disparities in maternal health outcomes 
	•	Co-signed Congresswoman Marilyn Strickland's letter calling for the inclusion of $350 billion in state/local aid in the rescue package 
	•	Co-signed a letter to President Joe Biden urging the expeditious nomination of vacant USPS board of governors slots 
	•	Co-sponsored the RESTAURANTS Act to provide $120 billion in relief to small restaurants 
	•	Co-sponsored the Essential Worker Pandemic Compensation Act to financially support families of essential workers who died from COVID 

It's an honor to serve each of you in Illinois' 3rd Congressional District. To follow my work in Washington, I urge you to stay connected with me on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram.

Dear Friend,
 
Texas is facing severe winter weather this week and many communities are dealing with slick roads, power outages and more. If you can avoid traveling, please do so. If not, please stay safe and stay alert while on the road. 
 
While we conitnue to battle the coronavirus pandemic, we must make sure that every American in every community is able to receive the critical medical care that they and their families need. In January, President Biden signed an executive order to open up the federal health insurance marketplace. Now until May 15th, you can get health coverage through ACA’s marketplace at HealthCare.gov.
 
The enrollment window is open to anyone who is uninsured and would normally be eligible to buy coverage in the federal marketplace.
 
As always, I urge you to follow my social media platforms @repcuellar to stay up to date on what's happening in the district and in DC.
 
Additionally, if you need assistance with a federal agency, please reach out to my office.

Intern Spotlight: Diego Hinojosa

On this week's intern spotlight, we're introducing Diego Hinojosa, who currently interns in my San Antonio office. Originally from Brownsville, Diego is a 3rd year college student, studying politics and law at the University of Texas at San Antonio.

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
Senator Baldwin is pleased to share that through May 15, 2021, Wisconsinites will have the opportunity to enroll in comprehensive and affordable health insurance coverage. 
Wisconsinites who either missed the original enrollment deadline for this calendar year or their first payment for their enrolled plan will now have another opportunity to sign up. Enrollees will also have another chance to review their plan to make sure it still meets their coverage needs, and many Wisconsinites will qualify for financial assistance such as tax credits to help make their premiums more affordable. 
This special enrollment period for 2021 health plans is open now through May 15, 2021 and assistance is available online or by calling 211. 
Insurance experts are available to offer free help with enrollment and to see if you qualify for financial assistance to lower your monthly costs. These experts can help you understand your coverage, simplify the enrollment process, and help you select a plan that fits your family and your budget. 
Click here to get free, expert help to select and sign up for a health insurance plan. 
Over the past year, Senator Baldwin repeatedly called for a special enrollment period in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Wisconsinites will now be allowed to sign up to receive health insurance coverage during this unprecedented public health crisis, and Senator Baldwin will continue taking action to make it easier for Wisconsin families to get the health care they need at a price they can afford.  
Please share this open enrollment information with your networks and encourage your friends and family to get health insurance coverage before May 15, 2021. 
Sincerely, 
The Office of U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin

2/17/21 11:32,Answering Your Questions On Small Business Relief,"February 17, 2021
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email
￼
Dear Friends, 

COVID-19 remains a threat to the safety and wellbeing of our communities. While I am working hard with my colleagues to pass another round of relief – including additional survival checks, extending and increasing unemployment, providing support to small business and funding our state and local governments, I wanted to share some key information on how to access some of the programs that Congress has already created to help respond to the crisis.  
The information below represents some of the most frequently asked questions on relief for small businesses – if you live in the 10th Congressional District and require additional assistance, please submit an inquiry through my website here. 
Small Business Relief
Paycheck Protection Program
The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) reopened for new First Draw applicants on January 11th and for Second Draw applicants on January 13th. Borrowers can apply for a First Draw or Second Draw PPP Loan until March 31, 2021, through any existing SBA 7(a) lender or eligible non-bank lender that is participating in PPP. The new law expands PPP eligibility to include additional categories of borrowers, including housing cooperatives, and expands the definition of “eligible expenses” toward loan forgiveness. 
For more information on the Paycheck Protection Program, click here. To search for a lender, visit the Small Business Administration’s Lender Match tool. For the full list of eligible expenses toward loan forgiveness, click here. 
You can also connect with a local Small Business Development Center for free small business counseling and assistance with the PPP loan application by filling out an intake form here.   
First Draw PPP Loans
At least $15 billion is being set aside for First Draw PPP loans to eligible borrowers with a maximum of 10 employees or for loans of $250,000 or less to eligible borrowers in low- or moderate-income neighborhoods. Borrowers seeking their first PPP loan will be eligible based upon the requirements previously set forth by the CARES Act and restated in the SBA’s January 6th Interim Final Rules.  
Second Draw PPP Loans
The Paycheck Protection Program now allows certain eligible borrowers that previously received a PPP loan to apply for a Second Draw PPP Loan with the same general loan terms as their First Draw PPP Loan. At least $25 billion is being set aside for Second Draw PPP Loans to eligible borrowers with a maximum of 10 employees or for loans of $250,000 or less to eligible borrowers in low- or moderate-income neighborhoods. Businesses do not have to apply at the same lender through which they received their first PPP loan. Full loan terms can be found here.  
Increased Assistance for Restaurants and Accommodation Sector Businesses

2/17/21 14:15,How do we help restaurant owners struggling under COVID restrictions?,"
￼
￼
￼

Hello Lindsey,

On Monday, I hosted a roundtable discussion with Weld County restaurant owners to learn more about the struggles they are going through as we deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and the shutdowns it has caused. 

I spoke at length with the restaurant owners who joined my roundtable about issues like the impact on our economy, minimum wage policies, COVID vaccines, and bipartisan solutions. 

I heard from Melissa and Eric Rickman, the owners of Wholly Stromboli in Fort Lupton, who said the one-size-fits-all approach from our state leaders isn’t working.

“I think people should have a choice about coming into a restaurant,” Eric Rickman said.

￼

New business owner Karen Cain, who opened the KM Cup in Fort Lupton last fall, told me that she has struggled to find financial assistance for her business. Because of their recent opening, The KM Cup is ineligible for loans and grants from the CARES Act. 

“We’re still putting in savings to keep the doors open,” she told me.

I will be taking the concerns like Karen’s and the Rickman’s with me to Washington D.C. this week. I will continue working with my colleagues to find solutions that will empower restaurant owners to keep their doors open.
 

> > > Click here to read more about the roundtable in the Greeley Tribune. 
￼

	•	Over the summer, I called on the Coronavirus Task Force to put forward a commonsense plan with cleaning standards that would allow our restaurant owners to reopen safely and quickly. 

	•	I also voted yes on the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act (H.R. 6886) to help ease the financial burden of small business owners. As we approach the one-year mark of coronavirus restrictions being implemented across the country, statewide actions to lift these restrictions are long overdue. 

	•	Just last week, I joined my colleagues in calling on President Biden to live up to his pledge to follow the science and encourage state and local leaders to begin reopening our country’s economy.

Dear Lindsey,
It's never been more critical that Oregonians have quality, affordable health care coverage as we continue to battle an ongoing national health crisis. The last thing families should have to worry about during a pandemic is how to afford their health care, especially if they're struggling to pay rent and buy groceries.  

To help folks get covered, President Joe Biden has announced a special enrollment period for individuals or families who want to shop for affordable coverage and might have missed the 2021 enrollment period. This special enrollment period is a great opportunity to get coverage for you and your family. You can enroll on HealthCare.gov through May 15. 

￼ 
Keep your family safe and healthy. Get affordable, quality coverage through HealthCare.gov today.

2/17/21 16:16,Poll: Undocumented Workers in the United States,"
￼
￼
￼

Dear Hoosiers,
 
For years, our nation has attempted to address the growing number of illegal immigrants entering our nation, predominantly at the Southern Border. Many of these undocumented immigrants apply and accept jobs in the United States.
 
In 2019, the Washington Post ran a piece that outlined the number of illegal immigrant workers holding jobs in the United States. At the time, “The Pew Research Center estimates that more than 7.5 million undocumented immigrants are in the U.S. labor force.” Hiring an undocumented worker is a federal crime, and both the employer and employee can face steep penalties for committing it. 
 
However, many acknowledge that identifying an undocumented worker has its own challenges. Today, over 900,000 employers use E-verify, an online system that checks the validity of employee-provided information— including citizen status. While this software is helpful for many, the high cost of the online system can be burdensome to many small businesses trying to make ends meet. 
 
But, without a way to verify personal identification information, it can be difficult to identify illegal immigrants who use stolen Social Security Numbers or other information to get a job. 
 
QUESTION OF THE WEEK: Should the penalty for hiring illegal immigrants fall on the employer or on the undocumented worker? 
 
[_] The penalty should fall on the employer 
[_] The penalty should fall on the undocumented worker 
[_] The penalty should fall on both parties 
[_] I don’t think there should be any penalty for hiring an undocumented worker 
[_] I don’t know 
[_] Other

2/17/21 16:19,Right or Wrong Time to Double the Federal Minimum Wage?,"￼

 
Right or Wrong Time to Double the Federal Minimum Wage?
 
  
Lindsey, 
 
The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Biden Administration's proposed doubling of the minimum wage to $15 per hour would result in more than 1.3 million jobs lost by 2027. Another recent study found that this policy would result in more than 100,000 jobs lost in Ohio alone. Small businesses still grappling with the economic devastation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could now be forced to contend with the possibility of a near-doubling of the minimum wage. 
  
  
 
Is now the right time for the federal government to impose a $15 minimum wage on Ohio's small businesses?
 
  
 
Yes
 
  
 
No
 
  
 
None of the above
 
  
  
Submit survey to sign up for updates on my work in Congress.*
  
Ohio's minimum wage, passed by a Constitutional Amendment in 2006, is adjusted annually based on the Consumer Price Index. The state's minimum wage, adjusted to $8.80 per hour as recently as January 1, 2021, applies to companies generating more than $319,000 annually. For companies not meeting the state's threshold, the federal minimum wage of $7.25 applies, for now. 
  
Has your small business been severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic? Click here or call my office at (614) 523-2555 for more information about available relief options.
  
Included in the Administration's $1.9 trillion stimulus package, the proposed $15 minimum wage would supersede state standards and put Ohio's rural small businesses at the same minimum wage standards as major cities, such as Manhattan and San Francisco. The indiscriminate hike would impose a near-doubling in labor costs for some small businesses, resulting in devastating job losses.
 
I want to hear from you. Please take a moment to complete my survey and let me know where you stand on this important issue.

2/17/21 17:30,Clyde in Congress: I won't give one inch in the fight to protect the 2nd Amendment,"

117th Congress, 1st Session | February 17th, 2021
￼


When I ran for Congress last year, I promised I would be a stalwart defender of the 2nd Amendment and that I would work to restore what has been lost. I will keep that promise and do whatever is in my power to ensure the right to bear arms is not infringed. 

We all knew that gun rights would be one of the first issues on the Democratic Party’s chopping block after the election. It seems that time has come, with President Biden recently calling on Congress to pass unconstitutional gun laws, include a ban on semi-automatic rifles, a ban on certain types of magazines, and eliminating immunity for gun manufacturers.

I refuse to give one inch in the fight to defend our gun rights, and I will fight back against the President’s proposals every step of the way. Having just celebrated President’s Day, I would hope Joe Biden would reflect on the actions of the great men who came before him, including George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, two men who understood the importance of ensuring the rights of Americans everywhere are respected.

House Oversight Committee marked-up Democrats’ $350 billion bailout bill for blue states
￼

As I shared with you last week, Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) passed a blank check budget bill that instructed House Democrats to find nearly $2 trillion so that Democrats can push through the President’s radical “American Rescue Plan.” Specifically, their instructions, commonly referred to as “reconciliation instructions,” not only specified how much money standing committees in both the House and Senate must cobble together to make their radical wish list a reality, but it allowed them to do so with no support or input from the Republican conference members. 

The House’s Oversight and Reform Committee, of which I am a member, was instructed by the President to spend $350 billion of the overall $2 trillion to provide COVID-19 relief to states, territories, and local governments. While Democrats say this $350 billion the committee debated and amended on Friday is targeted and fraud proof, the truth is that the money is nothing more than a bailout for states that have mismanaged their budgets for too long and is a giveaway to non-profit third-party entities that are not held to the same oversight standards as are state and local governments. 

Republicans on the Oversight Committee offered more than thirty amendments to prevent these dollars from being fraudulently spent, a goal that all Members of Congress should share. In fact, the amendment I offered, had it been agreed to, would have made certain wrongfully spent dollars are recouped by the federal government. Democrats agreed to similar language in last year’s CARES Act, but unfortunately, chose to put their liberal non-profit and special interest friends above hard-working taxpayers in this proposed bailout. Additionally, I supported amendments to prohibit federal dollars from going to recipients that have not reopened K-12 public schools, to states that have defunded their police departments, and to states that plan to use universal mail-in ballots in the upcoming 2022 midterm election. 
﻿
To that end, the Democrats’ $350 billion bailout bill passed out of the Oversight Committee strictly on partisan lines. I will continue to fight the Democrats’ egregious spending package at every opportunity presented to me and will keep working to ensure the dollars already appropriated for this pandemic are properly spent.
￼

Rep. Clyde applauds schools and communities returning to classrooms
￼

As we continue adapting and overcoming the myriad challenges the China virus (COVID-19) pandemic has presented, I would like to highlight the tremendous dedication shown by our school faculty and teachers. The transition to virtual learning has no doubt heightened the stress and difficulty involved in the task of educating our young people. As such, I believe it is important that we continue efforts to safely re-open our classrooms for in-person learning. 

Studies have shown that in-person classes benefit children both socially and mentally. In fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention established guidelines for opening classrooms, acknowledging the advantages of in-person learning. Additionally, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published an article indicating that there is little evidence of meaningful COVID-19 spread in schools. 

During his run for office, Joe Biden said his goal was to re-open schools within his first 100 days, and despite the CDC issuing a new science brief late last week that details how the transmission of COVID-19 in school setting is not substantial, he seems to be listening to the nay-sayers more so than his own public health officials. While the White House continues to drag its feet, I encourage the Georgia Department of Education, as well as local school administrations, to follow the CDC guidelines and establish face-to-face learning environments.

House Homeland Security Committee holds a hearing on cyber threats
￼

Last week, the House Homeland Security Committee held a hearing assessing the cyber threats posed to our nation’s critical infrastructure. This opportunity allowed my colleagues and I to learn first-hand about the most significant cyber threats facing our nation’s critical infrastructure from some of the country’s foremost cybersecurity experts.
﻿
Every day, our nation’s adversaries are actively seeking ways to circumvent our cybersecurity defense measures in an attempt to steal our national security secrets, our private and personal data, and our intellectual property. We must make every effort to stay ahead of this issue and galvanize our nation’s cyber defense capabilities. My line of questioning focused on the amount of threats our nation faces daily and how we can eliminate or mitigate a bad actor’s ability to be paid ransoms through ransomware attacks. My comments can be found here. 
￼

In the District

￼
￼

Last week I had the opportunity to tour Habersham Metal Products, an international leader in secure steel doors and windows. I enjoyed learning the 70 year history of their company and hearing about how they have creatively adapted to ever changing markets. The Ninth District should be very proud to know that their products protect not only the Buford Dam, but also the Washington Monument and embassies and consulates all around the world.

I was also able to meet with a wide array of constituents, both in person and virtually. From Special Olympics Athletes and the Georgia Federation of the Blind, to leaders in rural healthcare battling the opioid crisis. These meetings provide valuable insight into the issues impacting everyday Georgians across the Ninth District.

￼ ￼ ￼ ￼   
Friends,
This is a painful time for Southeast Texas. After more than our fair share of hurricanes and tropical storms, we are now enduring a historic winter storm that has paralyzed our state, risked countless lives, and threatens untold property damage. 
What is happening across our state is unacceptable, and the lack of adequate preparation by ERCOT or resiliency in our power grid is inexcusable. 
As our temperatures rise above freezing during the daytime hours, damaged pipes are leaking water, significantly reducing water pressure across systems.  Many communities are losing water pressure or facing boil water notices.  Utility crews across the district are working as quickly as they can to seal off leaks and restore pressure to our water systems.  
If you see leaking pipes, please report them to local government officials so they can be sealed. To report leaking pipes or for non-emergencies only, residents should call 311 or their local municipality (BRAZORIA COUNTY, GALVESTON COUNTY, JEFFERSON COUNTY).  Please do not call 911 unless it is a true emergency! Emergency 911 calls in the area are facing disruptions.  Residents experiencing difficulty getting through to 911 can call 311 -- dispatchers will transfer emergencies over to the 911 line. 
With cold surface temperatures and ice, road conditions are considered dangerous. We are urging drivers to stay home. If you must move about, please be safe. For road conditions and closures, visit DriveTexas, but note road conditions can change suddenly.
Please be sure to check on family, friends, and neighbors who may be without power for extended periods. If you or someone close to you is in need of a warming center, several have been established across the district and can be found at Warming Centers – TDEM (texas.gov).
Although, we do not yet have all the answers, I am working and will continue to work with my state and federal colleagues to get answers and formulate solutions so that nothing like this occurs again. In the meantime, I have been in contact with ERCOT, CenterPoint, Entergy, and Texas New Mexico Power. I will continue to work with local utilities, power providers, and government officials to encourage the fastest possible restoration of power to our community.
I want you to know that my office is here to help during the power outages and inclement weather. If you need assistance, call my district office closest to you: Beaumont Office (409) 835-0108, Lake Jackson Office (979) 285-0231, League City Office (281) 316-023.  Call 911 if you are in immediate danger or are having a medical emergency. I have included links below where you can find important updates, shelter information, and other helpful resources. 
This will be difficult, but just as we made it through Harvey, Imelda, and so many other storms, if we together and support each other, we will get through this and ensure this never happens again.  Sincerely, 
￼
Randy K. Weber

RESOURCES 
ERCOT UPDATE
I have been in contact with ERCOT and they are working tirelessly to get more power back on the grid. If you have power, please use it sparingly. This will make it easier to restore power to those still facing outages.
The grid itself is stable. Once we get power sources up and running to meet demand, it should be distributed quickly.
	•	
During ERCOT rotating outages this is what you can expect:
	•	Depending on the severity of the power generation shortfall, rotating outages may impact customers more than once.
	•	CenterPoint Energy will continue these rotating outages until it receives direction from ERCOT that the electric supply in Texas has stabilized and can resume normal operations.

UTILITY CONSERVATION
Water
Our water and wastewater systems are experiencing low pressure. To help maintain water pressure in the system during this winter weather event, please use water only for essential tasks and help conserve water by not running washing machines, dishwashers, or watering outdoors.  Once temperatures rise above freezing and power is restored, these are the best ways to thaw frozen water pipes:
	•	Open cabinet doors to circulate heat
	•	Use hair dryers, heat lamps or portable space heaters
	•	DO NOT USE open flames and/or propane torches (fire hazard)
	•	Continue to conserve water after pipes have thawed.
Energy
Texans are urged to conserve as much energy as possible. Power outages are expected to continue throughout Monday and Tuesday.  Conserve energy by:
	•	Turn off and unplug non-essential lights and appliances; and avoid using large appliances (e.g. ovens, washing machines, etc.).
	•	Turn down thermostats to 68 degrees or lower
	•	Open blinds and shades to take advantage of the sun's natural heat during the day
	•	Close shades and blinds at night to reduce the amount of heat lost through windows.
	•	We urge all residents to conserve resources such as electricity and water.

Congressman Gosar Statement on the Passing of
Rush Limbaugh
 
WASHINGTON D.C. - I join conservatives everywhere today in remembering and celebrating the life and enduring legacy of Rush Limbaugh. There are few in our history who have truly earned the title of American hero, Rush did. For over three decades, Rush tirelessly devoted himself to his country as the provocative host of the most listened-to radio show in the United States. His intellect and wit was second to none. His booming voice shifted the conservative landscape and reshaped the political narrative that will be felt for years to come. My thoughts and prayers are with his family at this time who I hope will take some comfort in knowing that his mark on this world will not long be forgotten. Thank you Rush, rest easy.

Committee Assignments

This Congress, I'll be serving on the Judiciary Committee and Education and Labor Committee, each with its own important areas of jurisdiction. 
￼

￼

The Judiciary Committee was originally established in 1813 to consider legislation relating to judicial proceedings (civil and criminal). Its jurisdiction includes the administration of justice in federal courts, administrative bodies, and law enforcement agencies. 

In modern times, the scope of the committee has grown to include bankruptcy, espionage, terrorism, the protection of civil liberties, constitutional amendments, criminal law, interstate compacts, immigration and naturalization, antitrust law, patents, copyrights and trademarks. 

﻿The committee also provides legislative oversight to the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland Security. 

Learn more about the Judiciary Committee
￼
￼
￼

The House Education and the Labor Committee oversees many programs impacting Americans from early learning and higher education to job training and retirement security. The scope of this committee covers:
	•	K-12;
	•	Higher Education;
	•	Job training, adult education, and workforce development;
	•	At-risk youth programs;
	•	Anti-poverty programs and programs for seniors;
	•	Pensions, health care, and other employer-sponsored benefits covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA); 
	•	Unpaid, job-protected leave as outlined in the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA), as well as ""comp time"" or family friendly work schedules; and 
	•	Labor laws, occupational safety, and workers compensation.

Budgeting Process Update

Unfortunately, Congress has not passed a real budget for some time, and this year a fast-track reconciliation process is being used to bypass standard budgeting processes again, this time for a $1.9 trillion package. You can find the budget resolution here and post-Committee mark-up updates to the text of the budget resolution here when they become available. 

The reconciliation process was originally established by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 to streamline deficit reduction, but has been abused by both sides to fast-track major budgeting decisions. Both sides would probably agree that our current budgeting process is broken and in need of real reform to establish a more transparent and efficient process.

COVID-19 Vaccine
￼

Last week, FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, announced a $7.9 million grant to the Indiana State Department of Health. These funds are allocated for vaccine administration. 

You can find out here if you're eligible for the COVID vaccine. Click to see Indiana's guidelines. 

In addition to the multiple vaccine sites throughout the state, vaccine eligible Hoosiers can now get their shots at Walmart or Sam's Club after it was announced last week the company would add distribution sites across the nation including 7 sites in the 5th District.

Information About COVID-19 Vaccine Appointments
A MESSAGE FROM CONGRESSMAN STENY H. HOYER    The COVID-19 vaccine is currently being distributed throughout our state. Though vaccine supply remains limited, I’m encouraged by President Biden’s commitment to increase the number of vaccine doses to states like Maryland, and by the launch of the Federal Retail Pharmacy Program so that individuals can get vaccinated at select pharmacies in their communities. I understand the frustration and confusion surrounding vaccine distribution in our state, and my staff and I are working diligently to encourage the Governor to make the process more transparent and easy to navigate. Vaccine supply is still limited in our state, but if you are eligible to receive the vaccine, you should register for an appointment as soon as possible. Marylanders 65 years old and older, health care providers, educators, law enforcement officials, those living and working in assisted living facilities, and individuals living in congregate facilities such as shelters and transitional housing are eligible to receive the vaccine now. Click here to see if you are eligible for the vaccine. Vaccines are currently being distributed by appointment only. To find a vaccination clinic near you and to register online for the vaccine, click here. The state of Maryland has also opened a COVID-19 Vaccination Support Center this week where you can get information on vaccines, identify providers in your area, and schedule appointments. The call center is open seven days a week from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m., and can answer questions about how to register to receive the vaccine. Call 1-855-634-6829 to speak with someone in the Support Center. 
As always, I encourage all Fifth District residents to continue to share their concerns and insights with me by contacting my office or connecting with me on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. If you are experiencing a personal difficulty such as issues accessing veterans benefits or another problem regarding a federal agency and you wish for my office to place an inquiry on your behalf, please complete the casework request form by clicking here.     
  
Sincerely Yours,       Steny H. Hoyer

Holding Washington's Employment Security Department Accountable
 
For some Washingtonians who had their identities stolen to collect benefits from Washington's Employment Security Division, they're being incorrectly told they owe taxes to the IRS on that money.
 
This is unacceptable and must be fixed, which is why I'm pressing ESD to take immediate action to save these fraud victims from additional hassle and financial headaches. Read more here.
 
Under the leadership of Suzi Levine, former Commissioner of the Washington State Employment Security Department (ESD) taxpayers were defrauded of more than $600 million dollars when signs of criminal behavior were missed or ignored. This theft also forced thousands of Washingtonians to go weeks without unemployment assistance. These bogus tax bills are yet another unfortunate chapter in ESD's mistakes during the pandemic. 
 
With this absymal track record, it comes as a shock that the Biden administration would appoint Levine to a National Employment Post. That's why I'm strongly urging President Biden to reconsider Levine's appointment. Millions of Americans who are relying on unemployment benefits cannot risk being negatively affected by Levine's proven poor leadership. Read my full letter to the president here.
  
  
 
Preventing Packing of the U.S. Supreme Court
 
 Packing the U.S. Supreme Court is a dangerous idea, which is why I am helping lead legislation to prevent it. Given recent calls by hyper-partisans to expand the court, it is now more important now than ever to preserve its integrity. Read more here.
  
  
 
GameStop Fallout: Investigation Needed Into Unfair Stock Market Manipulation

That's why I joined a bi-partisan group of lawmakers demanding answers from the SEC demanding into restrictions of GameStop trading activity. Read more here.

2/17/21 19:30,Winter Storm Resources,"
￼ 
Dear Neighbor,

Once again, I write to you as our community faces an enormous challenge.  Like many of you, I have been without power for most of this week, as have many members of our district team.  I share the frustration of many people who have reached out to me about the lack of preparation for and communication about the impacts of the storm and the power outages that have resulted in dire conditions for people in the district and across the state.

Many people have reached out to our office for help.  Our team in Washington is working around the clock to help in any way we can now, and will continue to do so in the days ahead.  I have included some of the resource information we have gathered this week below. 

Our first priority is to assist you, and our local and state government leaders, with federal resources and information.  I have been in contact with FEMA, as well as leaders in Congress and at the White House, to request additional assistance.  I am glad to report that FEMA is providing assistance now, and we will continue to push for resources, ranging from generators to blankets, to help us get through this disaster.  This is and must be our first priority. 

We must also have a full investigation into what happened, why it happened, and what we need to do to make sure it doesn’t happen again.  Yesterday, I joined many of my Texas colleagues in Congress in a letter demanding answers from ERCOT and the Public Utility Commission of Texas about what led to these grid failures and next steps to ensure power is restored.  Today, I joined my colleague Marc Veasey, who I serve with on the Energy and Commerce Committee, in a letter to request that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission investigate the failures that led to this crisis.  And this is just the beginning—there is much more to do in the days ahead.

Right now, we are in a crisis.  For those of you who have power and internet connections, the information here may be useful to you.  And if you do, I also encourage you to conserve it, using as little as you must so that others may be restored.

Above all else, I encourage you to follow the guidance from local leaders throughout the district as we work together to get through this disaster.

Contact Information
	•	To get the most up to date information from the Harris County Office of Emergency Management, text FREEZE to 888777 (I have signed up for this and it is quite helpful!).
	•	If you are looking for a warming center, call 211 or 311 or visit https://tdem.texas.gov/warming-centers/.  
	•	If you use durable medical equipment, like oxygen machines, that go out because they lose power, please call our team at 202-225-2571 and we will have someone contact you to see if we can help.
	•	If you see pets left outside unattended for extended periods, call 832-927-9297 for help.

Helpful Information
	•	You can track power outages at CenterPoint’s outage tracker: http://gis.centerpointenergy.com/outagetracker/index.html.
	•	If you do have power right now, please conserve it.  The less you use, the more other people can get their power restored:
	◦	Turn off and unplug non-essential lights and appliances. 
	◦	Avoid using large appliances (e.g., ovens, washing machines, dishwashers, etc).
	◦	Turn down thermostats to 68 degrees or lower. 
	◦	Open blinds and shades to take advantage of the sun’s natural heat during the day.
	◦	Close shades and blinds at night to reduce the amount of heat lost through windows.
	•	To keep warm, do:
	◦	Wear layers, especially hats and socks.
	◦	Stay inside and limit opening doors. 
	•	But:
	◦	Do not bring in any heating equipment meant for the outdoors like grills or heaters—this can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning. 
	◦	Do not sit in a car inside a garage—this can lead to carbon monoxide poisoning.
	•	The roads are icy and dangerous in these conditions.  Stay off the roads as much as you can.  This will help our police and first responders, who have asked us to stay home as much as possible. 
A boil water notice is now in effect in most of Harris County.  Water pressure is extremely low and many homes are without water entirely.  City of Houston officials have asked us to conserve water, as well, so that it available for hospitals, the Fire Department, and other emergency uses.
Boil Water Notice Tips
	•	Only use bottled water or water that has been boiled for 1-2 minutes (after reaching a rolling boil).
	•	Do not use water from any appliance, such as ice and water from a refrigerator.
	•	Brush teeth with boiled or bottled water, do not use untreated tap water.
Closures
	•	There will be no COVID testing or vaccines administered today or tomorrow.  Thursday, February 18. Houston Public Health will contact those with appointments to reschedule. 
	•	ALL Harris County Transit routes will not run on Thursday, February 18.
	•	HISD schools will also remain closed through Friday, February 19.

2/17/21 21:01,Getting Children Back in the Classroom,"
 

Last week, I heard from a number of families in Eastern Washington who are struggling with their mental health as a result of schools being closed and extracurricular activities being canceled.  

One mother says virtual school isn’t working. Her daughter is in hybrid learning, and she’s falling behind. She says that young people in our state have been neglected. They've been ignored. Told they aren’t important. Her daughter’s friend tried to end her own life. 
 

I’ve heard the same from a mental health therapist in Eastern Washington. Her caseload is up 75 percent. In 10 days, 7 teens reported self harm and suicide attempts. All 7 had zero history, but the isolation took a severe toll.  

For the health of our kids, we must come together in a bipartisan way to provide relief that ensures our kids are back in school, people are back to work, and everyone who wants and needs a vaccine gets one. 

We need to do it for families like Carla’s in Spokane. Carla is a mom of 3 teenagers and a softball coach. She told me that 60 percent of her team is in counseling for anxiety and depression. She’s had young athletes call her in the middle of the night who are contemplating suicide. They don’t see a way through it. 
 

To Carla and every other parent out there who is worried about their children, widespread access to the vaccine is the way that we will get through it. It’s how we’re going to reopen schools and restore our way of life for our kids. We need to increase the vaccination rate, and the time to do it is now. 

I stand by each and every one of our families in this fight. I have also joined my colleagues in sending a letter to President Joe Biden urging him to follow the science and get our children back in school. You can read the letter here. 
 
 
Three American Mothers, On the Brink

Mothers right here in Eastern Washington - and all across America - are struggling to get through this pandemic. Liz from Spokane said the only way to describe how she feels is “complete exhaustion.” And she’s not alone.

Last week, I asked you if you supported building additional broadband infrastructure to improve internet speeds. The results are in, and only 18% of you who responded thought that your internet speeds are fast enough. I agree! Our internet speeds are a big problem.  

The reality is that the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the challenges faced by families and workers in Eastern Washington who still do not have reliable access to the internet. This has prevented thousands from accessing vital health care, remote work, and economic resources. Unreliable internet and limited broadband access has also set countless children back in school because of connectivity issues while far too many schools remain closed. It’s unacceptable and hurting the next generation. To make a strong comeback from this pandemic, we must work together to close the digital divide. 

As Lead Republican on the Energy and Commerce Committee, I helped unveil our committee’s new Boosting Broadband Connectivity Agenda. This framework includes 28 bills to turbocharge public and private investment in broadband by promoting new and upgraded infrastructure deployments, boosting competition, streamlining permitting processes, facilitating broadband deployment on federal lands, and closing the digital divide in both rural and urban areas.  
 

 As part of this package, I introduced the Wildfire Wireless Resiliency Act to speed up projects to replace or improve wireless communications facilities damaged during a wildfire. This legislation creates a categorical exclusion from the National Environmental Policy Act and National Historic Preservation Act that allows for the expedited rebuilding or improving of broadband infrastructure that was damaged or destroyed by a wildfire. This exclusion is specific to damaged infrastructure within areas where the state’s governor has declared a natural disaster, and it applies for up to five years following the declaration. 

You can read the Wildfire Wireless Resiliency Act here.

Lat week, we took some time to reflect on President Abraham Lincoln's legacy. 

As I headed to the airport to attend President Joe Biden’s Inauguration last month, I grabbed a book called The Greatest Speech, Lincoln's second inaugural address. While reading it on the plane, I was struck by the parallels between March 4, 1865 and January 20, 2021. More importantly, I found myself with a renewed sense of hope that we can heal. 

In his second inaugural address in 1865, Abraham Lincoln said: 

“Each looked for an easier triumph, and a result less fundamental and astounding. Both read the same Bible, and pray to the same God; and each invokes His aid against the other.” 

On the heels of the Civil War, he concluded: 

“With malice toward none [and] with charity for all, let us strive on to finish the work we are in. To bind up the nation’s wounds. To care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan — to do all which may achieve and cherish a just, and a lasting peace, among ourselves, and with all nations.” 

The author said of Inauguration Day: 

“Just beneath the outward merry-making lay a different emotion. A weariness of spirit pervaded the nation. Many citizens were filled with as much anger as hope. Death and despair reached into nearly every home."" 

""Confederate sympathizers were still everywhere in the capital. General Winfield Scott had stationed sharpshooters on the roofs of the buildings along Pennsylvania Ave."" 

As I look around the Nation’s Capital today, I see barbed wire fencing around our Capitol building. Young servicemembers carry rifles in the streets, standing ready to defend our republic. A blanket of anxiety and polarization has thickened and is heavy over the city and our nation. 

President Lincoln was deeply concerned that a nation divided in war would remain a nation divided in peace. I fear the same could be said about our nation today. 

Still, I remain full of hope, and I pray that we may find inspiration from Lincoln. This has been a difficult year with covid-19, fierce protests, and a disputed election. With so many of our loved ones suffering from the trauma of health fears, job losses, business stresses, or financial strains, it’s easy to despair. But let us not lose faith in families and our community. May each one of us give thought to how we can restore civility, help a neighbor, and bring hope and healing to our family, our community, and our country. 
 
 

Q: Has anyone considered how long it would take to flush the mud and dredged soil out of the Snake River if the dams were breached, as well as the impacts on salmon populations? - Donald from Spokane Valley 

Thank you for your question. I believe breaching the Lower Snake River dams would be disastrous for Eastern Washington, which is why I am working hard to make sure that it doesn’t happen. Here’s why: 

The Snake River Dams are critical to our way of life in Eastern Washington because of the role they play in providing clean, renewable, reliable, and affordable energy. Breaching them would jeopardize our reliable, sustainable power grid, and without them, life as we know it in our region would cease to exist.  

Additionally, breaching these dams would have serious environmental consequences and put our salmon populations at risk. With a fish passage rate greater than 95 percent, the Lower Snake River dams are not the greatest threat to fish survival. Ocean conditions, rising carbon emissions, predation, and habitat loss are. These dangers to fish populations would only be worsened by removing the region’s clean, renewable hydropower resources.  

Instead, we must turn our focus toward solutions that get real results, like restoring water quality in Puget Sound, re-establishing critical fish habitat, addressing predation by seals, sea lions and birds, and improving technology at our dams to continue to make them even more transparent to fish.  

We know we must work together to achieve these goals, and that is exactly what I will continue to do in Congress.

What question would you like to see answered next week?

Did you see this? Washington State University is graduating its first class of medical students this spring! This is a special day for Eastern Washington, and I know each one of these students will have a tremendous impact on our community. Go Cougs!

Massive Health Crisis
 
 
￼
Did you know that a Black baby born in Youngstown, Ohio is more likely to die before they reach their first birthday than a baby born in Iran? And that’s not an outlier statistic, either. Black women as a whole are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications in the United States than white women are. This is a major failure of our medical system, and it has to change.
 
As a member of the Black Maternal Health Caucus, it is clear how much work we need to do to address our country’s urgent maternal health crisis. That is why last week we introduced the Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act, a historic legislative package that aims to end maternal mortality and close racial and ethnic disparities in the American health care system. This legislation builds on existing maternal health legislation like policies to extend postpartum Medicaid coverage, with 12 bills to comprehensively address every dimension of America’s maternal health crisis.
 
The Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act makes investments in social determinants of health, community-based organizations, the growth and diversification of the perinatal workforce, improvements in data collection, and support for moms and babies exposed to climate change-related risks. In addition to direct efforts to improve Black maternal health outcomes, the Momnibus Act focuses on high-risk populations, including veterans, incarcerated people, Native Americans, and other women and birthing people of color.
 
In the United States, it should go without saying that every mother has a safe and healthy pregnancy and every baby lives to see their first birthday. I am proud to join my colleagues in introducing this critical legislation to help put an end to this sad and alarming maternal health crisis and provide every mother with the quality, comprehensive care they deserve.
 
Best,
￼
Tim

Dear Lindsey,  
I pray this newsletter finds you and your family doing well and being safe as we make our way through the chilly, early months of 2021.  The extraordinary challenges of 2020—a global pandemic and corresponding economic downturn—continue to greatly affect our lives today.  I am committed to working with our state’s leaders and the new administration to ensure Mississippi has the resources it needs to continue our quest to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic.  Let us all continue to do our part.  The shameful January 6 attack on the U.S. capitol, followed by a divisive impeachment trial have not diminished my determination to work harder than ever for our state and our nation.  It was a great honor to take the oath of office to serve you all for the next six years.  No matter the tests we will face in the months ahead, I will keep the faith that good will overcome.  I remain abundantly grateful to all Mississippians for your confidence and ask for your prayers as the 117th Congress gets underway.  Thank you and God bless you all.                        
               Sincerely, 
                             ￼
 
￼
It was a blessing to have my husband Michael Smith and daughter Anna-Michael with me as Vice President Pence issued the oath of office.  This new six-year term fortifies my resolve to do more to help Mississippi grow economically and to improve the quality of life for all our citizens.  My 117th Congress committee assignments give me a seat at the table to represent you.  With Senator Wicker and the rest of our congressional delegation, we can continue to achieve good things for all Mississippians.
 
￼
The deaths of U.S Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick and others from the violent riot that overtook the U.S. Capitol serve as a constant reminder to be ever ready to protect our democracy.  As heartbreaking as that traumatic day was, the rushed impeachment by House Democrats amounted to a poorly- investigated, politically-motivated exercise that did nothing to unite the nation or to get to the bottom of the cause of the attack.
 
￼
We have more work ahead of us to #FinishThePumps to improve flood control for the Yazoo Backwater Area, but I am so proud of everyone’s efforts to bring this project closer to reality than ever before.  The Army Corps of Engineers Record of Decision signing in January was a critical milestone.  With $9.2 million provided in the FY2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act for pre-construction project planning and design, the Corps can now move into the next phase of implementation.  I will continue working to secure the resources needed to complete this project in the years to come.
 
￼
The inauguration of President Biden featured COVID-19 protocols and new hope for finding common-ground solutions to the major challenges facing our nation.  My conservative principles will guide me in making the best decisions possible for my state as the new administration embarks on its own ideas.  A closely divided nation and 50-50 Senate demand as much, though the President’s early executive actions and congressional Democrats handling of proposed $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief provoke legitimate and serious policy concerns.
 ￼
I am using confirmation hearings for President Biden’s cabinet nominees to determine how the new administration’s policies could affect Mississippi.  While there are areas of agreement and cooperation, some nominees and their policies require critical review.  I will continue to try to find common ground despite deep concern about the direction of this administration on energy, the environment, pro-life, border security, and other issues.

I always enjoy an opportunity to attend the Dixie National Rodeo.  This year’s 56th annual livestock show and rodeo was no exception.  Honoring my friend, the late legendary rodeo clown Lecile Harris, made this year’s event extra special.

Dear Friend,
 
 
Power outages have left some 4 million Texans searching for safety amid dangerously cold temperatures. That’s why my colleagues and I sent a letter to ERCOT, calling for answers regarding widespread power failures, particularly in our most vulnerable communities. 
 
I also spoke with ERCOT this week, expressing my concerns about what I have seen and heard from my constituents in South Texas. Hospitals are working at half capacity and water systems are failing county-wide due to the power outages. This is unacceptable- we must have accountability and transparency.
 
If you do have power, please conserve energy so that others in our community can access power as soon as possible.

Congressman Gosar Responds to Biden Directive to Release Illegal Aliens in Yuma County
 
 
WASHINGTON D.C. -Today, U.S. Representative Paul Gosar, D.D.S. (AZ-04) sent a letter to Yuma County Sheriff Leon Wilmot and Arizona Governor Doug Ducey urging them to immediately implement a plan to intercept the 50 illegal aliens that the United States Customs and Border Protection recently announced they will begin immediately releasing into Yuma County on a daily basis. The responsibility to stop this release, and imprison and deport the potentially infected aliens, rests with the Federal Government and the Biden Administration. Congress has funded law enforcement for that purpose.  The release of infected aliens is not authorized by Congress. 
 
Citing the risk to public health and safety given that lack of adequate plans to screen for COVID-19, implement quarantine standards or perform background checks on these illegal aliens before their release into the general public, Congressman Gosar is demanding local law officials detain and return them to their country of origin.  Additionally, Congressman Gosar recommends that the Federal Emergency and Management Agency use the trillions of dollars in COVID-19 emergency relief funds to offset the costs for the apprehension and treatment of these illegal aliens.  
 “Where these illegal aliens go after their “release” is anyone’s guess. Phoenix. Tucson. Prescott. San Diego. These are super spreader events that will go off daily. If we are to take seriously the state and County’s efforts to rein in the pandemic, then releasing 50 potentially positive cases into Arizona every day is a threat to public health and constitutes an emergency,” said Rep. Gosar.
 Congressman Gosar will continue to work with local Arizona and Federal agencies to obtain a viable plan to keep Arizonans safe during this COVID-19 pandemic.
 You can read the letter HERE. 
 
Background: 
This week, Congressman Gosar was informed by Yuma County Supervisor Jonathan Lines of concerns raised by the City of Yuma, as well as San Luis and Somerton, pertaining to the imminent release of 50 illegal aliens every day into Yuma County by the United States Customs and Border Protection.

Thune Leads Bipartisan Letter in Push for Financial Relief for Farmers and Ranchers
Senator John Thune recently joined Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) in leading a group of bipartisan members of Congress in urging the U.S. Department of Treasury and Small Business Administration to broaden their implementation of legislation Senators Thune and Baldwin got enacted into law last year that allows farmers and ranchers to calculate their Paycheck Protection Program loans using gross income. This would ensure that farmers and ranchers operating as limited liability companies and partnerships would be eligible to calculate their loan award using gross income. Thune continues to support South Dakota’s farmers and ranchers throughout these challenging times.
The full letter is available here.

2/18/21 15:15,Extreme Winter Weather Update and Resources,"
 
 

February 18, 2021

Dear Friend,

I know you are rightfully frustrated right now. North Texans are only beginning to see their power restored after spending more than three days in the dark and cold. Like many of you, I was without power from early Monday morning until today, using blankets and my fireplace to stay warm while tending to burst pipes and a leaking ceiling. I know this is happening at homes all across Texas and these issues should have never occurred in the first place. 

Now is the time for Texas to make a change. We have to take a good hard look at our baseline power generation and better evaluate our reliable energy sources. This power outage has had devastating consequences for our state, and I’m committed to working with our state and local partners to ensure this never happens again.

While my top priority right now is working to fix this ongoing problem, there must be accountability for the widespread outages we are witnessing. My colleagues and I sent a letter to the President and CEO of ERCOT yesterday seeking answers, but we also need solutions. It is imperative that we get to the bottom of how this power outage occurred in order to ensure it never happens again.  

In a news release this morning, ERCOT announced that they made significant progress overnight in restoring customer power, although some outages still remain throughout the state. At this time, ERCOT said that customers without power likely fall into one of three categories:  

	1.	Areas out due to ice storm damage on the distribution system;
	2.	Areas that were taken out of service due to the energy emergency load shed that need to be restored manually (i.e., sending a crew to the location to reenergize the line); and
	3.	Large industrial facilities that voluntarily went offline to help during this energy emergency.

I will continue pressing for answers, but my commitment this week is to make sure you have the resources you need. As soon as I receive further information, I will do my best to communicate it as quickly as possible. I have compiled below a list of resources that may be helpful for you and your neighbors as we recover from this storm. If you have access to a working phone and need assistance accessing additional information, please do not hesitate to contact my office. We are ready to serve as a resource for you as we all navigate this extreme weather.

Stay safe and warm,
 

Congresswoman Beth Van Duyne (TX-24)

Boil Water Notices

Many cities in North Texas are under a boil water notice. Here is a list of cities under the boil water notice with points of contact for any questions or concerns. 

DENTON

The City of Denton issued a boil water notice yesterday. The testing process is expected to take at least 24 hours and the City staff anticipates to begin testing the water supply on Friday, Feb. 19, 2021.

Click here for more information. 

FORT WORTH

The City of Fort Worth issued a boil water notice for western portions of the city. The following information is courtesy of Fort Worth:

Because of a loss of water system pressure, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality requires the City of Fort Worth, PWS ID 2200012, to notify water customers in the western portions of Fort Worth to boil their water prior to consumption (e.g., washing hands/face, brushing teeth, drinking, etc). 

This impacts customers from Montgomery Street westward. The three cities in this area that buy drinking water from Fort Worth – Aledo, White Settlement and Westover Hills – have been notified. 

Children, seniors, and persons with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable to harmful bacteria, and all customers should follow these directions. 

To ensure destruction of all harmful bacteria and other microbes, water for drinking, cooking, and ice making should be boiled and cooled prior to use for drinking water or human consumption purposes. The water should be brought to a vigorous rolling boil and then boiled for two minutes. 

In lieu of boiling, individuals may purchase bottled water or obtain water from some other suitable source for drinking water or human consumption purposes. 

When it is no longer necessary to boil the water, the public water system officials will notify customers that the water is safe for drinking water or human consumption purposes. 

Once the boil water notice is no longer in effect, the public water system will issue a notice to customers that rescinds the boil water notice in a manner similar to this notice.

Guidance for High-Risk Residents
 
High risk individuals, such as seniors, those with certain health concerns, or families with infants, experiencing extended power outages, should make arrangements to stay with family, friends, or a neighbor who has power. Locally, shelters and warming centers are opening to the public. A list of these locations can be found at the bottom of this email.
 
If you or a loved one depends on electric or battery powered medical devices such as respirators, ventilators, oxygen machines, or home dialysis equipment, please contact your healthcare provider immediately. If you are experiencing a health emergency, don't take any chances and call 911 right away.

Staying Warm Without Power

	•	Wear layers of loose-fitting, lightweight, warm clothing
	•	Close blinds and curtains to retain heat
	•	Stuff towels or rags in cracks under doors
	•	Close off rooms to avoid wasting heat

Keeping Safe

	•	Delay travel plans and avoid driving
	•	Do not use a charcoal grill, stove or oven to heat your home
	•	Keep indoor space heaters several feet way from other items
	•	Place generators outdoors and away from windows, on dry and level surfaces, and never plug them into a wall outlet or main electrical panel

If you are using a fireplace to stay warm, follow these tips to stay safe. 

If you have pets, click here to learn how to keep them warm. 

Conserve Energy
 
If your household continues to have power, please take these critical steps to conserve usage and reduce the burden on the power grid:

	•	Turn down thermostats to 68 or lower
	•	Close shades and blinds to reduce the amount of heat lost through windows

2/18/21 15:27,Getting Covered During the New ACA Open Enrollment Period,"￼
￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ 
 
￼ 
Dear friend,
On January 28th, President Biden signed an executive order strengthening the Affordable Care Act and giving you greater opportunity to have access to affordable, quality health care. Due to the pandemic, the Biden Administration opened a new enrollment period for health care on February 15th that runs through May 15th. This is a unique opportunity that is especially important while we battle the COVID-19 pandemic. If you are uninsured or would like to change your insurance plan, I encourage you to visit HealthCare.gov to learn about the Marketplace Health Insurance plans, compare your options, and enroll. For Spanish speaking constituents, all resources and information are available in Spanish at CuidadoDeSalud.gov. 
Most marketplace enrollees qualify for financial assistance to lower the cost of their coverage. Last year 9 out of 10 percent of Americans qualified for financial assistance and 2 out of 3 people could receive a monthly plan for $10 or lower!
You can also find free assistance to help you pick the best health care coverage for you and your family. If you are a Milwaukee County resident, Covering Wisconsin has free resources to help guide you through this process. You can also call Covering Wisconsin at 414-400-9489 to speak with an expert. If you are not in Milwaukee County, you can call Covering Wisconsin at 877-947-2211 and find your county’s resources here. All Wisconsin residents can choose a plan and connect with a local expert at WisCovered.com. 
I urge you to take this unique, three-month opportunity to enroll in an affordable health care plan for you. If you had health care in 2020, please check to see if your plan still meets your needs in 2021. I promise to keep fighting in Congress for your right to accessible, quality health care. 
Your friend,  Gwen Moore

Sen. Rick Scott Shares Helpful Resources for 2021 Tax Season
Dear Floridian, 
The below information is from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS): 
On February 12, 2021, the IRS began processing 2020 tax returns.  
Last year’s sweeping set of tax changes not only affected individuals and their families but may also affect the tax return they’re filing this year. A new IRS fact sheet explains what taxpayers need to know this year to file a complete and accurate tax return. 
Most income is taxable, including unemployment compensation, tax refund interest and income from the gig economy and virtual currencies. Taxpayers should gather any documents related to these types of earnings and include them on their return. To speed refunds during the pandemic, the IRS urges taxpayers to file electronically with direct deposit as soon as they have the information they need. 
People can begin filing their tax returns immediately with tax software companies, including IRS Free File partners. Taxpayers will need to check “Where’s My Refund” for their personalized refund date. 
Taxpayers have until April 15, 2021, to file their 2020 tax return and pay any tax owed.

2/18/21 16:18,Baldwin Announces Introduction of the Equality Act,"

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
Today, Senator Baldwin announced the upcoming Senate introduction of the Equality Act—historic, comprehensive legislation to ban discrimination against LGBTQ Americans, just as religious, racial, and gender discrimination are illegal everywhere in the United States.  The announcement coincided with the bill’s introduction by Representative David Cicilline in the U.S. House of Representatives. The House passed the Equality Act in 2019 but it was buried in former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s legislative graveyard. The Senate bill will be formally introduced next week when the Senate floor re-opens for bill introductions. 
“It is just wrong that in a majority of states, LGBTQ Americans live without fully-inclusive non-discrimination laws and can still face discrimination simply because of who they are or who they love. It is time to end this kind of discrimination because LGBTQ Americans should have the freedom of full equality,” said Senator Baldwin. “I know the House will do its job to pass the Equality Act and the Senate should do the same and get the job done so that we provide full equality for every LGBTQ American across our country.” 
The legislation would amend the landmark federal anti-discrimination laws to explicitly add sexual orientation and gender identity to longstanding bans on discrimination in employment, housing, public accommodations, jury service, access to credit, federal funding, and more. It would also add protections against sex discrimination in parts of anti-discrimination laws where these protections had not been included previously, such as public accommodations and federal funding.  LGBTQ equality received a huge boost across the nation last June when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Bostock v. Clayton County that workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity is prohibited as a form of sex discrimination under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. However, this court ruling has not yet been nationally applied to other areas of potential discrimination—including housing, public accommodations, jury service, access to credit, and more. Many Americans believe that such protections are already explicitly written into federal civil rights law, but this is not the case. The Equality Act would finally enshrine these protections into federal law under all areas of potential discrimination and ensure that these essential protections for LGBTQ Americans are not subject to the whims of a changing court.  Read more about how the Equality Act will provide full equality for every LGBTQ American here.

2/18/21 17:00,Vaccines and Our Veterans Town Hall,"Latest Vaccine News
￼
  Dear Lindsey, 
Two years ago when I first took office, I knew our nation faced many challenges (in fact, it was why I decided to run). But I think I speak for all of us when I say this pandemic has changed our lives in ways no one could have imagined. I mentioned in my most recent message to you that the overwhelming majority of calls and emails my office received were about vaccine distribution--that still holds true today. It's why I held a Vaccines Town Hall earlier this month, spoke with veterans about vaccines this week, and why the focus of this update is to answer vaccine questions we hear most often.
Let me be very clear. I am deeply frustrated too.   I am exploring every avenue to get more vaccine doses into our district. Data shows that Pennsylvania isn't getting its fair share, and neither is our community--that's unacceptable. I am in regular contact with local and federal entities, including the Biden Administration and Governor's Office, and pushing for more vaccines. There is also reason for hope. Just this week, our efforts helped increase our weekly allocation by 40,000 doses. Being our Representative is the honor of my lifetime, and I will always work for the good of our community, Commonwealth, and country.

In This E-Newsletter You Will Find:  Recent Events — Including the audio recording of this week's Veterans Town Hall where we discussed navigating the VA Medical System to get a vaccine appointment.  Vaccine Distribution FAQs —  Including where Pennsylvania stands in our vaccine allocations, what pharmacies Pennsylvania is parterning with to distribute vaccines, how to make an appointment in Chester and Berks counties, and more. 
 .  .  .

Recent Events
Bringing Together VA Medical Center Experts for a Veterans Town Hall
￼

Our veterans and their caregivers face unique challenges and deserve direct access to VA and health care professionals to have their questions answered. We were so thankful Angela King-Sweigart from the Lebanon VA Medical Center and Kirk Fernitz from the Coatesville VA Medical Center were able to join us for our town hall. For those who weren't able to attend, you can find the full audio recording here. Our panelists also shared helpful information that we've included below.
For Veterans Who Frequent the Lebanon VA Medical Center
You must be enrolled in VA Health Care in order to receive a COVID-19 vaccine. Call their enrollment office for eligibility and information: (717) 272-6621, ext. 6000.
If you are already enrolled in VA Health Care, the best and quickest way to get contacted for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine is to indicate you're interested by signing up at the Keep Me Informed Tool. After signing up, you will be contacted via text to schedule your appointment for your first vaccine.  
Lebanon VA Medical Center is currently scheduling for those veterans 65 and older. If you believe you should have been contacted, please reach out to their scheduling line at (717) 272-6621, ext. 5105.
Caregivers are eligible for the vaccine. However, you must be enrolled in the VA's Caregiver Support Program. When the veteran is eligible, you may be eligible as well. The vaccines are scheduled together. If you are unsure whether or not you are enrolled in a Caregiver Support Program, please visit here for eligibility and general information. Their coordinator is Teresa Stump-Klinger, LCSW, (717) 272-6621, ext. 5739.
All veterans enrolled in VA Health Care have a Patient Aligned Care Team. One of the members of their team is a social worker. Social workers can be a resource for veterans. They assist veterans, their family members, and caregivers in resolving housing, finance, mood, relationship, and physical limitation issues in individual, group, or family treatment, whichever suits your needs. To reach your social worker, reach out to your primary care provider at the VA. 
For Veterans Who Frequent the Coatesville VA Medical Center
The Coatesville VA Medical Center is now vaccinating veterans 65 and over with Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine. They are offering the vaccine to veterans who are at the greatest risk for infection and severe illness based on the CDC's guidelines and will continue to work their way through the established priority groups.  Information on the COVID-19 vaccine is changing quickly. Sign up for their Keep Me Informed tool for more information. Veterans who wish to indicate their interest in getting the COVID-19 vaccine can do so at that time.  Care teams will contact you when a vaccine is available to you based on your personal risk factors and vaccine availability. Using the information in your medical records, they will attempt to contact you by telephone first and then text or email based on your listed preferences.  When you are called to schedule your vaccine appointment, they will provide you details about where to go on campus to get your shot. Currently, they are offering COVID-19 vaccinations at their main medical center, the Delaware County and Spring City outpatient clinics. The vaccine clinic at the Coatesville Campus is located in Building 139, across from parking lot D, and near the point of entry off of Blackhorse Hill Road.  As always, you can visit their website for more information. Here are some additional helpful phone numbers: 
	•	Caregiver Support Program: (610) 384-7711, ext. 5310
	•	Enrollment and Eligibility Office to Enroll for VA Health Care: (610) 383-0265
	•	COVID-19 Vaccine Scheduling: (610) 384-7711, ext. 5705

General Vaccine Distribution FAQs

￼
How can I schedule a vaccine appointment?
Berks County residents can visit the Berks vaccine webpage to locate local vaccine providers. Tower Health, Berks Community Health Center, and PennState Health are currently vaccinating Berks residents.
Chester County residents can register to be contacted when a COVID-19 vaccine appointment is available through the Chester County Health Department. After you complete the form you will receive updates from the health department on vaccine availability and open appointments. If you have additional questions, you can contact their vaccine call center at (610) 344-6225. You can also visit the Pennsylvania Department of Health COVID-19 Vaccine page to see a map of other vaccine providers in our area and contact information for them.
What can those who are elderly, or who do not have access to the internet, do to make a vaccine appointment?


PA’s Department of Aging can help seniors schedule appointments through local hospital systems. The department can also help folks arrange transportation if needed.
Chester County Department of Aging: (610) 344-6350
Berks County Department of Aging: (610) 478-6500
Residents can also contact the PA Dept. of Health at 1-877-724-3258 for more information on scheduling a vaccine appointment. Only folks who fit under the 1A group are being vaccinated at this time, therefore they are the only ones who can schedule vaccination appointments.
Berks County residents without access to technology can contact:
Tower Health: (484) 659-3000, Mon-Fri, 7:30AM to 5:30PM
Why is Pennsylvania falling behind in vaccinating people?


Pennsylvania has administered the first doses to 9.5% of its population. The main challenge lies in supply. The federal government is responsible with vaccine allocations, not the state. PA has a high elderly population, who fall under phase 1A. This population, which includes roughly 4 million people, are the priority group. Once the supply of vaccine dosages is expanded, PA along with the rest of the country will be able to move along the group phase to ensure that all who wish to be vaccinated can do so.
When will the state begin mass vaccination clinics?

The state’s department of health is working on a plan to begin mass vaccination clinics throughout the state. Once the supply of vaccines improves throughout the country, mass vaccination clinics will be possible. Currently, PA’s bipartisan legislative vaccine task force will be meeting on a regular basis to develop a better distribution plan. Officials and lawmakers will be working with consultants and some in the private sector on the effort.
I heard that Walgreens and CVS will also be conducting vaccinations to the public as well, is that true?

No, Walgreens and CVS are a part of the Federal Pharmacy Partnership for long-term care facilities. This means that these pharmacies have been tasked with coordinating with long-term care facilities, nursing homes, assisted living facilities, etc. to travel to each facility and vaccinate residents and staff.
Is PA participating in the Retail Pharmacy Partnership? If so, who can get vaccinated at these locations?

Yes, Pennsylvania is participating in the Retail Pharmacy Partnership. The retail pharmacy partners are Rite Aid and Topco (supermarket pharmacies such as Shoprite, Acme, Wegmans, and others). Folks can register online for an appointment on the Rite Aid site. Currently, Rite Aid is not scheduling vaccine appointments over the phone. Please visit your local grocery store website to schedule an appointment online or contact their vaccine customer service line accessible through their website. Oupnly folks in the current group phase will qualify for an appointment. Currently, PA is vaccinating those in the 1A group
Should I travel to neighboring counties or states to obtain my vaccine? I have been registering at multiple places at once hoping to get an appointment.
It is recommended that folks do not travel to other states or counties to obtain a vaccine. If you live in Chester County, you should receive your vaccine in Chester County. By travelling to other counties and registering at multiple places at once, you are overwhelming the system and making it more difficult to obtain a vaccine not just for yourself, but for everyone else. If you do decide to travel outside of your county or the state, it is vital that you return to the same location to obtain your second dose of the vaccine. Vaccine providers, counties and hospitals are tracking those who receive their first vaccine dose at their sites to ensure that there are sufficient vaccine doses for those same people to get their second dose. When people get vaccinated at one location and attempt to go to another for their second dose, it vastly delays and disrupts the cycle of vaccine distribution. It is important to do our part in preventing back up that will affect the flow of vaccinations in PA.
Where can I find information about vaccine allocations specifically in PA?

Data related to vaccine allocation in Pennsylvania can be found on the CDC website. Additionally, folks can visit PA’s vaccine data webpage to access information related to specific counties and cities.

There are members of our community reading this e-newsletter who are on the front lines of distributing vaccines to our families, friends, and neighbors. To all of you, we send our utmost appreciation and thanks. This is a monumental challenge, and none of this would be possible without your efforts. As I've said since the beginning of this pandemic, we are in this together. We will continue to provide vaccine information to everyone as it becomes available. For immediate updates, I encourage you to follow us on social media, linked below.

We want to hear from you. Please stay in touch and let us know what you thought of this e-newsletter. As always, we invite you to call one of our offices or message us through our contact form. Feel free to pass this update along to friends of our community so they can keep in touch too.

Protecting Your Gun Rights: Congresswoman Greene Introduces Gun Owner Privacy Act

Washington, D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene (GA-14) delivered again for Americans and the Second Amendment by introducing the Gun Owner Privacy Act (GOPA). This pro-gun legislation ensures that gun ownership is not monitored and logged by the federal government, and provides legal recourse by allowing damages to be collected by citizens whose rights have been violated. 

As Democrats in Congress push for registration and licensing of firearms with H.R. 127, GOPA will prohibit such a gun control scheme by providing legal protections for Americans. The Gun Owner Privacy Act (GOPA) prevents the government from unlawfully compiling and storing data from background checks on gun owners.

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene issued the following statement:

“The right to keep and bear arms is a God-given right protected by the Constitution. I'm proud to stand up and defend against threats to our Second Amendment rights in Congress. That's what the people of Northwest Georgia sent me to do. 

The Gun Owner Privacy Act protects the right to keep and bear arms by preventing the Feds from collecting data to monitor and log gun ownership in America. This legislation will give Americans legal recourse and the ability to sue the Feds and collect damages for records illegally stored.

Privacy is critical to every free nation, but currently Democrats in Congress with the backing of the White House have introduced legislation (H.R. 127) which would strip that right of privacy and make gun owners targets of a tyrannical government.""

Congressmen Scott Perry (PA-10) and Thomas Massie (KY-4) have joined Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene (GA-14) as cosponsors of GOPA.

Acquitted Again
Dear Friends,
For the second time in thirteen months, Donald Trump has been acquitted of impeachment charges by the U.S. Senate – as was widely expected.
In the wake of the tragic and horrifying riot at the U.S. Capitol Building on January 6, Congressional Democrats rushed to cast blame squarely on Donald Trump, almost immediately drafting an article of impeachment alleging that Trump had “incited an insurrection” during his address to the crowd.
As it has become increasingly clear that the “storming” of the Capitol was coordinated and planned by militia groups in advance long before Trump ever took the stage at his rally, it was no surprise that the former president was acquitted.
Furthermore, the acquittal felt inevitable once Trump’s defense team showcased the absolute hypocrisy of Democrats casting judgement on the former president for using fiery political rhetoric when their own statements in recent years have been just as inflammatory, if not more so.
If you haven’t seen the defense’s presentation in the Senate trial, you can watch here. 
In 2017, Senator Bernie Sanders inspired a gunman to attack a group of House Republicans during a morning Congressional Baseball Game practice, nearly killing and severely wounding my friend Congressman Steve Scalise. Then you have the Democratic Chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who openly encouraged people to aggressively assault Trump supporters and cabinet members. And who could forget Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, who in August labeled all Republicans “domestic enemies.”
I could go on and on. No Democrat has ever faced the condemnation and scorn that the Left and their allies in the mainstream media have expressed about Donald Trump.
I believe that the country would have benefited from a genuine and bipartisan investigation into the events of January 6. Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi allowed no investigative hearings and threw the normal impeachment process to the wind in her rush to blame Donald Trump. As a result, even more than a month after the riot, we still lack answers to some of the most fundamental questions surrounding January 6. Notably, there’s still no clear explanation as to why the security around the Capitol was so inadequate and unprepared despite numerous warnings ahead of time by federal law enforcement.
It has begun to come to light that Speaker Pelosi herself may have been partly responsible for the security failures on January 6. As Speaker of the House, Pelosi is responsible for all operational decisions made within the House of Representatives, including security. Two days before the Capitol riot, the then-Chief of Capitol Police requested National Guard support and was denied. In the midst of the riot, the Capitol Police again requested National Guard assistance and it took over an hour for the request to be approved by the House Sergeant at Arms – who reports directly to Speaker Pelosi.
Americans deserve a clear understanding of the events surrounding the January 6 riot. What we don’t need is more political theatrics and partisan games. Now that the impeachment has failed, I sincerely hope we can turn our attention to answering these important questions.

Remembering Rush Limbaugh 
I am truly heartbroken that Rush Limbaugh has tragically passed away following a hard-fought battle with stage 4 lung cancer.
 
My wife Dee Dee and I have listened to Rush regularly since the 1980’s. Without his influence, I would not have had the courage and inspiration to share my own Christian conservative message on the airwaves as a talk radio host – which ultimately led me to Congress.
 
It is impossible to overstate the tremendous influence Rush had on the conservative movement. He was truly a titan, giving a voice to millions of Americans who were abandoned and sidelined by the mainstream media outlets. He paved the way for proud patriots to speak up and speak out against corruption, and continued to do so throughout his 30-year radio career.
 
Going forward, let us honor Rush’s legacy by continuing to fight for the conservative principles and traditional values he held dear.
 
Dee Dee and I are praying for Rush’s family, friends, and listeners during this difficult time.
 
I was lucky enough to be given the chance to pay tribute to Rush Limbaugh on my friend Todd Starnes’ radio program yesterday. You can listen here.

Re-Opening Our Schools
One way or another, all Americans have suffered during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is our most innocent and vulnerable – children – who may have suffered the most. Much of their suffering is a direct result of being blocked from returning to school month after month.
While many school districts in Georgia have been fully or at least partially open for in-person learning, other parts of the country have refused to open even with reasonable safety precautions in place. Being out of the classroom for such a prolonged period has been incredibly detrimental to America’s youth. Suicides, hunger, and domestic violence have all been on the rise among children throughout the pandemic. This tragedy needs to come to an end.
For months, we have known that children are not at a significant risk to the virus – yet millions of children remain stuck at home. In fact, children are likely suffering even more from the lockdown than the virus itself. For example, in children, suicide and drug-related deaths have far outnumbered deaths from COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic.
Last week, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) released long-awaited guidance on how schools can safely reopen for in-person learning. These guidelines include phasing-in students starting with the youngest and least susceptible to COVID-19, ensuring that children are taking steps like wearing masks, and practicing contact tracing should any cases arise. You can learn more about the CDC’s guidelines here. 
Let’s get America’s children back into school!

February Hice Headliner 
Each month, I have the great honor of recognizing an outstanding citizen of Georgia's 10th District. 

This month's Hice Headliner, Maria Reese, hails from Oconee County where she shows exceptional love for her community by organizing volunteers and crafting over 13,000 facial coverings out of her alteration shop. Local nursing homes, hospitals, and shelters have benefitted from the masks that Maria and her band of volunteers have put so much time into. 

￼

On behalf of Georgia's 10th Congressional District, I would like to thank Maria for her selfless service and compassionate care for her community. 

Sincerely,

￼

Live Telephone Town Hall Recap
 
  
Hi Lindsey,
 
On Tuesday, I held a live telephone town hall with representatives from the Pennsylvania Department of Health and the U.S. Small Business Administration to discuss PA's COVID-19 vaccine rollout, as well as economic relief that's available now or coming soon. 
 
Thank you to everyone who joined and came with thoughtful questions and feedback. I know we need to do more to ensure everybody’s economic wellbeing and distribute the vaccines as soon as possible. There is more help on the way as we are finishing up the process of putting the American Rescue Plan into writing in the U.S House. It’s a proposal that will help us get back to normal faster with investments in coordinated vaccine distribution, in testing and in emergency response.
 
View a recap of the town hall or listen below to learn about the relief avaialble now and vaccination efforts underway.

Expanding Hearing Benefits for Seniors
 
  
Among older Americans, hearing loss is common. With 1 in 3 American seniors experiencing the issue, chances are you or someone you know has trouble hearing. Regular checkups and hearing aids are simple solutions, but the problem is, they are really expensive -- often between $1,000 and $5,000 each -- and Medicare doesn't cover them.
 
So today, I reintroduced my HEAR Act with Rep. John Katko, a Republican colleague of mine from New York. It's a commonsense bill to improve Medicare by ensuring auditory exams and hearing aids are covered, so older Americans aren't faced with the unfair choice of going without these life-enhancing solutions, or paying several thousand dollars out of pocket, if they can even afford to.
 
We made good progress on this bill in the previous Congress; it passed as part of a larger bill, but like so many other good bills with Democratic and Republican support, it got stuck in Mitch McConnell's Senate. I'll be working this year to get this all the way across the finish line.

An Exciting New Addition to Our Team
 
  
This week, I was so proud to announce that State Senator John Blake will be joining my office to spearhead economic development initiatives across the Eighth Congressional District. The Senator will be resigning his seat, but he will do so after serving Northeastern Pennsylvania honorably in Harrisburg for 10 years.
 
John is a lifelong Northeastern Pennsylvanian and a dedicated public servant with a fierce commitment to creating more opportunity for the people in our area.
 
At the start of this new Congress, I vowed to accelerate my efforts to direct more job-creating federal investments to Northeastern Pennsylvania. With his extensive economic development experience, John will play a big role in this mission.

Dear Neighbors, 
I hope this message finds you safe and well. As always, if you have questions or concerns, please contact my office by calling (847) 413-1959, emailing me at IL08.helpline@mail.house.gov, or sending a message through my website at https://krishnamoorthi.house.gov/contact/email.

Thank You To All Who Joined My Virtual Reception
I want to thank everyone who joined my virtual open house reception yesterday. I also want to thank the Buffalo Grove High School Choir for opening the event with our national anthem, as well as our guest speakers including IL House Speaker Welch, IL Senate President Harmon, DuPage County Chairman Dan Cronin, Cook County Commissioner Kevin Morrison, and Kane County Chairman Corinne Pierog. We looked back at our accomplishments in the last Congress and looked ahead to our legislative priorities and the work ahead in this one. Thank you, again, to everyone who joined us!

My Work On The House Oversight Committee To Provide State And Local Aid
Last week, the House Oversight and Reform Committee passed $350 billion in state and local aid to be included in the upcoming COVID-19 relief package. As Chairman of the House Oversight Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy, I was proud to have a significant role in shaping this legislation and voting in support of it. This plan provides Illinois and its local governments with approximately $13.2 billion to help combat the pandemic and help local governments avoid tax increases and cuts to public services. This is necessary assistance for states across the country that are struggling, and I will vote in favor of the COVID-19 relief package containing this provision once it reaches the House floor.
The Reintroduction Of The Bipartisan SAFE TO DRIVE Act
Earlier this month, I reintroduced the SAFE TO DRIVE Act along with Congressman Mike Gallagher (WI-08) and Congressman Steve Cohen (TN-09) in the House as Senator Amy Klobuchar (MN) and Senator Richard Blumenthal (CT) introduced a Senate version. Our bipartisan bill creates two supplemental grants for states to use for distracted driving prevention. Distracted driving – driving while also trying to text, call, clean, eat, or undertake any other activity – killed over 3,000 people in 2019, a nearly 10 percent increase from 2018. These statistics are avoidable tragedies, and during a pandemic when our hospitals are overburdened, we must look for ways to increase safety mechanisms. The SAFE TO DRIVE Act has been endorsed by 22 organizations, including the National Safety Council (NSC) which is based right here in our community.
Stay Updated Through My Social Media Accounts

Dear Friend, 
As a result of the COVID-19 crisis, millions of Americans have lost their employer-provided health insurance, and it’s possible that you or a loved one may be one of them. A loss of health benefits can be devastating at any time, but more so during a public health emergency when Americans may find themselves in need of urgent or lifesaving care. 
Fortunately, folks who’ve lost their coverage during the pandemic now have an opportunity to sign up for health insurance through HealthCare.gov.
The Biden administration’s decision to open a Special Enrollment Period – something I called on the last administration to do more than eight months ago – will ensure that all Virginians have the opportunity to get covered once again if they lost their benefits during the pandemic. This Special Enrollment Period is open now through May 15th, so I encourage you to visit HealthCare.gov to determine your eligibility and find a plan that works for you. You can also call 1-800-318-2596 to speak to someone about your options. You may be eligible for tax credits or other assistance to help lower your insurance costs.
As we’ve seen this past year, the COVID-19 virus can take a toll on anyone – young or old; sick or healthy. Therefore, it’s crucial that all Virginians get covered.     I know these times are challenging, but we will get through them together. In the meantime, I encourage you to care for yourself and your neighbors by washing your hands, wearing a mask, and practicing social distancing.
If you want to share your thoughts about an issue that’s important to you, you can send me an email any time using the form on my Senate website. You can also follow me on Facebook and Twitter. I look forward to hearing from you. 
Sincerely, 
￼

Dear Friend, 
The coronavirus pandemic has forced Americans to face unprecedented challenges including financial hardships and new health problems during the pandemic. That is why Covered California recently announced an emergency Special Enrollment Period (SEP) from February 1 to May 15, during which you can find affordable health insurance.   Over 2.7 million Californians do not have health insurance. Covered California is here to help and is available to provide financial support for eligible Californians who are still uninsured. Every 3rd District resident deserves the peace of mind that comes with having affordable, high-quality health insurance. Don’t wait—register for coverage now. 
￼
Click Here to Enroll 
If you don’t have health insurance right now, or if you’re shopping around for better options, visit Covered California, our state’s official health benefits exchange authorized by federal law under the Affordable Care Act. Through Covered California you can shop for a plan that’s right for you and check if you are eligible for subsidies that could help make health insurance more affordable.  Covered California features plans offered by high-quality insurance providers for both individuals and small businesses. Thanks to the Affordable Care Act, you also can’t be turned down or charged more for a pre-existing condition. All plans are required to cover essential benefits like hospitalization, maternity care, and mental health.  To learn more about the options available to you, http://www.coveredca.com/, or call (800) 300-1506. You can even find an in-person enrollment center near you at https://storefronts.coveredca.com/. Please make sure to check out your options before open enrollment closes.

2/19/21 11:06,What We Know: Statewide Vaccine Pre-Registration System,"￼

Dear Lindsey,  I hope you and your family are staying safe and warm as we continue to face severe winter storms.
 
I'm writing to provide you with all the information my office has received regarding Virginia's new COVID-19 vaccine pre-registration system, available online or by phone. Please continue reading to learn more.
  
 
New Pre-Registration Website
 
  
On Tuesday, the Virginia Department of Health (VDH) launched a new, centralized website to allow Virginians to pre-register for the COVID-19 vaccine at vaccinate.virginia.gov. This new website is replacing all pre-existing local registration portals. If you have already pre-registered through your local health district, your name is being automatically imported into the new system and you do not need to register again. You can confirm your preregistration here.
 
This centralized website allows you to pre-register for a vaccine, check your registration status, and access additional information on the vaccination rollout in Virginia. This system does not guarantee an appointment, but it allows residents to notify the Commonwealth of their interest in receiving the vaccine so that they may be contacted to schedule an appointment.
 
If you have additional questions regarding the pre-registration process, please click here. You can also read answers to frequently asked questions on the Virginia Department of Health website or contact your local health district for specific information related to COVID-19, including current vaccine phases and testing events.
  
Pre-Register for COVID-19 Vaccine
  
 
COVID-19 Vaccine Hotline
 
  
To accommodate Virginians who may be uncomfortable using the online form or who are unable to pre-register online, The Virginia Department of Health launched a statewide hotline Wednesday to complete pre-registrations over the phone, as well as answer any questions.
 
Call (877) VAX-IN-VA or (877) 829-4682 from 8am to 8pm, 7 days a week.
  
Call the pre-registration hotline at (877) 829-4682
  
Virginia is rolling out the vaccine in phases. To determine which phase of Virginia's vaccination campaign you fall in, click here.
 
Over the past several weeks, I have heard from many Central Virginians who are frustrated with the vaccine rollout, and I consistently communicate the feedback I am hearing from you with state officials. While my office is unable to directly coordinate with local government to schedule vaccine appointments for constituents, I am focused on doing everything I can to get you the answers and care you need.
  
Sincerely,
Abigail

2/19/21 11:34,Providing Assistance With Filing Your Taxes,"February 19, 2021
Click here if you have trouble viewing this email
￼
Dear Friends, 

With COVID-19 having added newfound confusion and difficulties to overcome in nearly all facets of life, I know that many of you have questions about how to file your taxes this year and how to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit. To make the process more straightforward and less challenging, my office has prepared answers to some of the most frequently asked questions on how to pay your taxes and claim a rebate. If you live in the 10th Congressional District and require additional assistance, please submit an inquiry through my website here.  
Economic Impact Payments
As a result of the COVID relief bill I voted for, the IRS and the Treasury Department delivered a second round of Economic Impact Payments to millions of Americans of up to $600 for individuals or $1,200 for married couples and up to $600 for each qualifying child. Click here for more information on the payments.  
How to Claim a Recovery Rebate Credit
If you did not receive a payment in the first and/or second round of Economic Impact Payments, you may be able to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit on your 2020 tax return. You can claim the credit if you meet the eligibility criteria for the payment, and did not receive a payment (including for each qualifying child), or your payment was less than what you were due. 
Eligible individuals should claim the Recovery Rebate Credit on their 2020 Form 1040 or 1040-SR. These forms can also be used by people who are not normally required to file tax returns but are eligible for the credit.  
The IRS has created a Recovery Rebate Credit worksheet in the 2020 tax return instructions that you can use to figure the amount of any Recovery Rebate Credit for which you are eligible. You can find this on page 59 of the 1040/1040-SR instructions. You will then need to enter the total amount due to you on line 30 of your 1040/1040-SR. 
Filing 2020 Taxes
This year, Tax Day is Thursday, April 15th. The Internal Revenue Service recently announced that tax season started on Friday, February 12th, which was the first day you could file your 2020 tax return.  
Current IRS Operations
While the IRS is open and processing mail, tax returns, payments, refunds and correspondence, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to cause delays in many IRS services, notably paper returns and mailed notices. The IRS is encouraging all filers to submit their 2020 tax returns electronically rather than by mail, if possible, due to ongoing delays in processing paper returns.  For updates on current IRS operations and delays, click here.  
If you are still awaiting processing of your already-submitted 2019 return, do not refile returns electronically or by mail because the IRS may flag the refiling as fraud. There are still millions of pieces of mail not yet opened. 
Free Tax Preparation Resources
The IRS Free File program, available only through IRS.gov or the IRS2Go app, offers brand-name tax preparation software packages at no cost. The software is free for those who earned $72,000 or less in 2020 and some of the Free File packages also offer free state tax return preparation. Taxpayers comfortable filling out tax forms electronically, can use Free File Fillable Forms, regardless of income, to file their tax returns either by mail or online. These forms can also be used by those who are traditionally non-filers but need to file a 2020 return in order to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit.  
Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE)
The IRS's Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) and Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) programs offer free basic tax return preparation to qualified individuals. If you are elderly, disabled, speak limited English, or are a taxpayer who earns less than $57,000 annually, you can access free tax help using the VITA Site Locator Tool or by calling 311. 
Sincerely,

Dear Lindsey,
 
Over the past month we have witnessed the new administration bypass Congress and not even try to work out policy through legislation before changing the nation’s direction from the Oval Office.
 
President Biden has unilaterally made consequential decisions that destroy entire sectors of the economy, undermine the rule of law, and raise the cost of life-saving drugs like insulin.
 
By moving the practice of lawmaking back to the Congress and the states, where it belongs, we can reduce the magnitude of presidential elections and lower the stakes in that race. Restoring the proper balance between the branches would be like a pressure relief valve on our national discourse. 
 
Read my latest oped in St. George News here or below. 
  
￼
  
 
Getting Our Children Back in the Classroom 
 
  
The Biden Administration refuses to follow the science and work to reopen schools—putting politics before our children.
 
That's why I joined my colleagues in urging President Biden to listen to his own CDC Director and to reopen schools and businesses across the country. Click here to read the full letter.

This week I joined my friend and colleague Rep. John Curtis (R-UT) as well as Rep. Joe Neguse (D-CO) in joining the Bipartisan Wildfire Caucus. Through this caucus, we will work together to prioritize wildfire prevention and recovery. [KSL News]

I Want to Hear From You 
 
  
Please join me for a telephone town hall Thursday, Feb. 25, from 7-8pm MT. I'll be answering your questions and discussing my top priorities for this Congress.

2/19/21 12:07,VA Vaccines: what you need to know," ￼    ￼   ￼

￼
We’re reaching a critical time to slow the spread of COVID-19 as vaccines are becoming more readily available for eligible folks across Montana. So if you’re a veteran receiving care with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), it’s absolutely critical that you get vaccinated as soon as possible. 
As Chairman of the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee, I’m working to ensure that every veteran in Montana and across the country has access to a vaccine. I’m proud to announce that as a result, VA has distributed vaccines to nine locations across Montana—with additional locations to be announced in the coming weeks. But we’ve got to connect more vets with the vaccines they need. If you’re a veteran looking to get a vaccine, here’s what you need to know:
→ VA is working to provide COVID-19 vaccines to veterans as quickly and safely as possible, based on CDC guidelines and available supply. VA will contact you when you are eligible for a vaccine. You do not need to contact VA or come to a VA facility to reserve a vaccine, but you can sign up here to stay informed about when you can get a vaccine from VA. 
→ If you’re not yet enrolled in VA health care, please call (877) 468-8387 and select Option 4 to find out if you’re eligible for a vaccine. Unenrolled veterans are encouraged to call as soon as possible. 
→ For more details on your local VA health facility’s current vaccination plan, find your facility’s website and click on health care services, then COVID-19 in the menu.
→ Every veteran who receives VA health care should double check that their cell phone number, email address, and mailing address are all up to date here.
￼ 
You can find answers to general questions about getting a vaccine at VA here. If you don’t find your answer there, please call VA’s main information line at (800) 698-2411. 
The reality is that the COVID-19 vaccine is our best shot at protecting our communities, putting this virus behind us, and getting our economy back on track. I encourage all veterans and caregivers to sign up to stay informed about how to stay protected during the pandemic.
As always, stay safe and be well.

2/19/21 12:30,Baldwin Helps Introduce U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 to Reform American Immigration System,"

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
Senator Baldwin has cosponsored the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, President Biden’s bold, inclusive, and humane framework for the future of the United States immigration system.  
“Our immigration system is broken and we need to work together in Congress to fix it. The U.S. Citizenship Act prioritizes keeping families together and provides hardworking Wisconsinites, including Dreamers and the essential workers who add value to our communities, an opportunity to earn citizenship,” said Senator Baldwin. “The legislation addresses the root causes of migration from Central America, and will help us responsibly manage and secure the border with smart investments. With this bold legislation, we will modernize our immigration system with comprehensive reforms that can help us strengthen our economy.” 
The legislation, which was introduced today, would provide millions of hardworking, undocumented immigrants with a pathway to citizenship, including Dreamers, Temporary Protected Status (TPS) recipients, and essential workers who have made enormous sacrifices during the pandemic; prioritize family reunification and keeping families together; and bolster the country’s long-term economic growth. The bill would also equip the country to responsibly and effectively manage the border with smart and effective investments, address root causes of migration that force people to leave Central America, and restore the United States’ commitment to human rights.   Specifically, the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 establishes a moral and economic imperative and a vision of immigration reform that is expansive and inclusive: 
	•	Creates an earned roadmap to citizenship for all 11 million undocumented immigrants, providing  Dreamers, TPS holders, and some farmworkers with an expedited three-year path to citizenship, and giving all other undocumented immigrants who pass background checks and pay taxes with an eight-year path to citizenship without fear of deportation.
	•	Reforms family-based immigration system to keep families together by recapturing visas from previous years to clear backlogs, including spouses and children of green card holders as immediate family members, and increasing per-country caps for family-based immigration. It also eliminates discrimination facing LGBTQ+ families, provides protections for orphans, widows and children, allows immigrants with approved family-sponsorship petitions to join family in the U.S. on a temporary basis while they wait for green cards to become available.
	•	Grows our economy by making changes to the employment-based immigration system, eliminating per-country caps, making it easier for STEM advanced degree holders from U.S. universities to stay, improving access to green cards for workers in lower-wage industries, and giving dependents of H-1B holders work authorization, and preventing children of H-1B holders from aging out of the system. The bill also creates a pilot program to stimulate regional economic development and incentivizes higher wages for non-immigrant, high-skilled visas to prevent unfair competition with American workers. 
	•	Increases funding for immigrant integration initiatives and supports state and local governments, NGOs, and other community organizations that conduct inclusion programs, provide English language assistance, and make available naturalization resources to immigrant communities.
	•	Protects workers from exploitation and improves the employment verification process by requiring the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Labor to establish a commission involving labor, employer, and civil rights organizations to help improve the employment verification process and granting workers who suffer serious labor violations greater access to U visa relief.
	•	Supports asylum seekers and other vulnerable populations by eliminating the one-year deadline for filing asylum claims, reducing asylum application backlogs, increasing protections for U visa, T visa, and VAWA applicants, including by raising the cap on U visas from 10,000 to 30,000.
The U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 also addresses the root causes of migration and prioritizes U.S. national security:  
	•	Addresses the root causes of migration from Central America by funding the President’s four-year plan to increase assistance to El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras conditioned on their ability to reduce the corruption, violence, poverty, and famine that now causes people to flee. 
	•	Creates safe and legal channels for people to seek protection, so they can apply for legal status in Central America instead of making the dangerous journey north. The bill also re-institutes the Central American Minors program to reunite children with U.S. relatives and creates a Central American Family Reunification Parole Program to more quickly unite families with approved family sponsorship petitions.
	•	Cracks down on bad actors by enhancing the ability to prosecute individuals involved in smuggling, narcotics and trafficking networks who are responsible for drugs flowing into our country and the exploitation of migrants. It will also expand transnational anti-gang task forces in Central America.
	•	Improves the immigration courts and protects vulnerable individuals by expanding family case management programs, reducing immigration court backlogs, expanding training for immigration judges, and improving technology for immigration courts. It also restores fairness and balance to our immigration system by providing judges and adjudicators with discretion to review cases and grant relief to deserving individuals, and also gives funding for school districts educating unaccompanied children. 
	•	Modernizes and manages the border effectively through the use of technology that enhances our ability to detect contraband and counter transnational criminal networks since illicit drugs are most likely to be smuggled through legal ports of entry. It also authorizes and provides funding for plans to improve infrastructure at ports of entry to enhance the ability to process asylum seekers and detect, interdict, disrupt and prevent narcotics from entering the United States.
	•	Protects border communities by providing for additional rescue beacons to prevent needless deaths along the border, requiring agent training and oversight to investigate criminal and administrative misconduct, and requiring department-wide policies governing the use of force. It also authorizes and provides funding for DHS, in coordination with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and nongovernmental experts, to develop guidelines and protocols for standards of care for individuals, families, and children in CBP custody.

2/19/21 12:30,Newsletter: Vaccination Locations Open Across Florida Keys,"
￼

Dear Friends,
 
As Florida ramps up its weekly purchase of COVID-19 vaccine doses, more and more locations are opening up throughout South Miami-Dade and Monroe Counties. 
￼

While there is a constant ebb and flow of information surrounding the number of doses available and locations in your community serving as a vaccination center, there is one thing that will always remain constant. I urge you to pre-register for your vaccination and ensure you have a place in-line. This can be done by visiting the official pre-registration portal managed by the State of Florida here. Individuals who do not have access to a computer can call 1-866-779-6121 to pre-register or direct any questions about eligibility. Click here to search by county or city to find vaccination sites. You can sign up for text updates about the vaccine by texting ""COVIDUPDATE"" to 888777. 
 
My office has been in communication with the office of Governor Ron DeSantis and Director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management Jared Moskowitz to ensure everything is being done to get our South Florida communities the doses to meet demand. Overall, Florida was the first state in the nation to begin offering vaccines to the staff and residents of Florida’s 4,000+ long-term care facilities. Florida was also the first state to offer vaccines to frontline workers, including EMTs and paramedics, and to mobilize county health departments and county emergency managers to actively vaccinate seniors 65+ throughout the state.

As of right now, eligibility for the COVID-19 vaccine is defined by Executive Order 20-315, which was signed by Governor DeSantis in December of last year, as:

	•	long-term care residents and staff,
	•	persons 65 years of age and older,
	•	Florida-based health care personnel with direct contact with Florida resident patients.
﻿
Again, I urge you to please pre-register so you will have no problem in accessing a vaccination location when more doses are made available in your community. If my office can be of any assistance to you, please do not hesitate to contact us via our website. 

 
Sincerely,
Carlos A. Gimenez
Member of Congress

Gimenez Urges Constituents to Re-Open Casework

Congressman Carlos Gimenez’s staff is ready to serve the constituents of Florida’s 26th congressional district. If you had a pending case with the previous representative’s office, Gimenez’s office urges you to contact them. 
 
The previous representative, ex-Congresswoman Debbie Mucarsel-Powell, did not transfer any of the information over to Gimenez’s office during the transition, and so new cases must be opened.
 
If you cannot get an answer from a federal agency in a timely fashion, or if you feel you have been treated unfairly, our office may be able to help resolve a problem or get you the information you need. If you would like for my office to assist you with a federal agency, please click here and submit a digital privacy release form. 
 
The offices will also provide an array of additional constituent services, including:

·      Service Academy Nominations
·      Internships
·      Congressional Art Competition
·      Congressional App Challenge

￼

This can be done by visiting the official pre-registration portal managed by the State of Florida here. Individuals who do not have access to a computer can call 1-866-779-6121 to pre-register or direct any questions about eligibility. 

Gimenez Joins Homeland Security Committee Republicans Demanding Border Security

Congressman Carlos Gimenez signed a letter from Congressman John Katko (NY-24), the lead Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee, demanding a stronger approach to border security by the Biden Administration. In the letter, Gimenez and his colleagues call on President Biden to reconsider his executive orders rolling back Trump-era policies that secured the southern border.
 
“Simply put: Republican Members of the Committee believe these actions are putting politics ahead of national security at a time when the American people are demanding better,” the letter states.
￼

Gimenez has long stated that border security is paramount to preserving the integrity of America’s national security and believes there is room to engage in comprehensive immigration reform while securing the border. “I support policies that put more resources into curbing illegal border crossings and keeping illicit drugs and criminal activities off our streets,” Gimenez stated in a tweet on Friday.

2/19/21 13:01,Blaine’s Bulletin: Black History Month,"￼ 
February 19, 2021
For Immediate Release | Contact: Georgeanna Sullivan (202) 225-2956 

BLAINE’S BULLETIN: BLACK HISTORY MONTH
Every February since 1976, America has come together to celebrate Black History Month and the contributions of African Americans to our nation and its history. It was originally just a one-week celebration during the second week of February to celebrate the birthdays of Frederick Douglass, an abolitionist who spoke about his first-hand experience as a former slave, and Abraham Lincoln who changed our nation forever by ending slavery with the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation. However, it became clear that more than a week was necessary to celebrate this rich history, and every president since 1976 has signed a declaration designating February “Black History Month.” 
Missouri has been home to some incredible African Americans who have made lasting impacts on this country. One of the most famous Missourians was Dred Scott of the 1857 Dred Scott v. Sanford decision, a case that students across America learn about in their history books. Dred Scott was a slave who was taken from the then slave state of Missouri into the free state of Illinois and as a result, believed – rightly so – that he was a free man. Despite taking his case all the way to the Supreme Court, he was unfortunately before his time and they ruled against him in his request for freedom. While the Court did not rule in Dred Scott’s favor, this was a landmark court case and one of the most important moments in abolitionist history. 
As a baseball lover, I’m very proud that Missouri was home to the Kansas City Monarchs, the longest-running franchise in National Negro League history. Formed in 1920 at an exceedingly contentious time for race relations in America, this team overcame the obstacles and adversity and became one of the National Negro Leagues’ most winning teams with just one losing season and two trips to the leagues’ World Series. The Monarchs franchise was also home to some of the most famous Americans to ever play the game like Satchel Paige and Jesse Williams. If you’re ever headed west, I would highly recommend a visit to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City. To get there, you might cross the Missouri River on the Buck O’Neil Bridge, named after an absolute legend of baseball. After his incredible career with the Kansas City Monarchs, Buck O’Neil defied the odds to become the first African American coach in Major League Baseball. Because of his impact on the game and society as a whole, in 2008 the National Baseball Hall of Fame created the Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award, which is only awarded once every three years to people who have achieved extraordinary impacts on baseball and American society. While I admittedly would prefer to visit Busch stadium to watch my Cardinals, I’ve made a few trips to Kaufmann Stadium in Kansas City over the years. I will always remember watching young children and grown men visit Buck’s seat behind the third baseline to get their gloves signed or shake hands with the hero of so many.  
The achievements of Black history in Missouri can be seen today in the many black owned businesses across our state. Like all small businesses across Missouri, they have suffered a tough year losing business due to shutdowns and some unfortunately having to close their doors for good. As our state continues to recover, please try to shop and dine local to help support our state’s small businesses whenever you can. The last year has been especially difficult one for our nation. Not only did we face a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic, but we saw strained race relations in many cities across the country. This Black History Month is a great time to embrace our differences and celebrate the African Americans who have contributed and continue to contribute so much to our state and this country.

Greetings,
I hope you are staying warm and keeping safe this week. Arkansas has braved a tough winter storm, and while it has brought beautiful winter scenery across the state this week, I know for many it has made day-to-day life difficult. My prayers are with each of you, and if there is anything our office can be of assistance with, please don't hesitate to reach out to our team. 
During my time in Congress, I have always been proud to champion religious freedom and our First Amendment rights. Time and time again, we have seen Democrats try to strike God from the oath of office or remove God from the Pledge of Allegiance. I had a firsthand experience with that this month at the Natural Resources Committee, where Democrats attempted to strike God from the oath. I was proud to take a stand for religious liberty and ask that they put God back into the oath, which they did. 
As your representative, it is an honor to take a stand for what is right. I will always fight to make sure that our values are represented and protected in Congress.
Until next week,
￼
Bruce Westerman

Bald Eagle Release
￼
Last weekend, I participated in the release of a rehabilitated bald eagle at Hickory Nut Mountain. Tommy Young, a wildlife rehabilitator from Mena (pictured below left), released his 113th rehabilitated bald eagle on Saturday. 
￼  ￼
The event was attended by many local conservationists and members of the Lakota tribe. Mr. Young started the Arkansas Native Plant and Wildlife Center in Mena, where he cares for and rehabilitates animals from across Arkansas.
￼
The bald eagle is our national symbol and is a protected species. Next time you are in the area, keep your eyes peeled and you just may see one flying by. I've been lucky to spot them over the years at Lake Ouachita, and thanks to the work Mr. Young does, we can spot more bald eagles right in our own backyards. 
Winter Wonderland
My two dogs Clyde and Clara experienced their first big snow storm, and they loved it. I hope you and your family had some fun outside- Clyde and Clara sure did!

 Thought of the day: “The struggle you are in today, is developing the strength you need for tomorrow.” 
Coronavirus Update

On Thursday, Michigan reported 888 new cases of COVID-19 and 85 new deaths, bringing the state’s total cases to 578,091 and deaths to 15,273. COVID case counts are continuing to trend downward from Michigan’s peak in late November 2020. With cases continuing in a hopeful direction, we have got to stay committed to following the CDC’s guidelines, by wearing a mask (two is better than one, according to the CDC), keeping our physical distance, and washing our hands.  
The more contagious COVID-19 B117 variant is threatening the progress Michigan has made in mitigating the spread of the deadly COVID virus, with at least 157 confirmed cases on Wednesday. Michigan’s Chief Medical Executive Dr. Khaldun has warned we have reached a point of community spread with the more transmissible strain of the virus.
On Thursday, Michigan reported 2,301,795 COVID vaccines have been distributed and, of that, 1,740,608 vaccines have been administered. That rollout of COVID vaccines has been less than smooth. Many who qualify to receive one of the vaccines don’t know how to get an appointment, and when they do, some appointments are being cancelled due to shortages. With vaccines offering our greatest hope at crushing COVID, getting people back to working, and reopening our schools, we’ve got to do whatever we can to increase the supply of vaccines and get them into the arms of Americans.
The Biden Administration has taken a number of steps to increase vaccine supplies, increase the speed of vaccinations, and improve communication on the safety of vaccines. We’ve got to make sure we are using available laws, like the Defense Production Act, to their fullest power. We need to make sure we are working closely with states who are our partners in administering vaccines.  
Today, President Biden will be in Michigan to get a first-hand look at Pfizer’s vaccine production and meet with workers as the Administration continues working to increase the supply and availability of vaccines.
The Biden Administration has expanded vaccine distribution to 41 qualified health centers throughout Michigan, giving Michiganders more options to receive one of the life-saving vaccines. I encourage folks to visit Michigan.gov/COVIDVaccine to find to the most up-to-date information from the state, including vaccine eligibility, safety information, and clinic locations. Michiganders without access to the internet can call the state’s COVID-19 hotline at 888-535-6136 Monday through Friday, 8 am to 5 pm, to receive information from the state.
Through President Biden’s Federal Retail Pharmacy Program, local pharmacies like Meijer and Rite Aid have began offering COVID vaccines to eligible Michiganders. These pharmacies have launched webpages to provide the most up-to-date information on their vaccination plans, including options for eligible Michiganders to pre-register and schedule appointments for COVID vaccines online or by phone.
Michigan continues to prioritize vaccines for those 65 and older, front-line workers, some state and federal workers, jail and prison staff, Pre-K through 12th-grade teachers, and childcare providers.
To pre-register with a Meijer Pharmacy, visit their online pre-registration form or text “COVID” to 75049 or call your local Meijer Pharmacy. Visit Meijer Pharmacy’s COVID vaccination webpage for more information.
To check your eligibility and schedule a COVID vaccine appointment with Rite Aid, visit their COVID-19 Vaccine Scheduler. 
￼
At the direction of President Biden, the ACA Marketplace opened on Monday, February 15th for a Special Enrollment Period (SEP), empowering Americans without comprehensive health care coverage to visit HealthCare.gov and shop for a plan that meets their needs.
ACCESS Community Health & Research Center is providing free, independent assistance during the Special Enrollment Period to residents needing help enrolling in the right plan for their needs.
 Legislative Update
In Congress, we are continuing to work hard on President Biden’s American Rescue Plan. With COVID destroying lives and livelihoods, we have got to get this bill done. The relief bill has been fast-tracked in the House and we will be passing it next week to send over to the Senate and have signed by President Biden before unemployment expires in March.
The current relief package includes:
	•	$1,400 survival checks for Americans
	•	Necessary investments to safely reopen schools
	•	Direct housing and nutrition assistance to struggling families
	•	Increased unemployment assistance
	•	Raising the minimum wage for 27 million workers
	•	Support for state and local governments who are facing dire budget shortfalls
	•	Support for small businesses, including expanding the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP)
	•	Critical resources for our nation’s frontline workers
And much more to help struggling Americans and build back our economy.

Michigan is busy at work distributing and administering COVID vaccines. More information can be found by following the links below.

Local pharmacies like Meijer and Rite Aid have launched webpages to provide the most up-to-date information on their vaccination plans, including options for eligible Michiganders to pre-register and schedule appointments for COVID vaccines.

To check your eligibility and schedule a COVID vaccine appointment with Rite Aid, visit their COVID-19 Vaccine Scheduler.
Last night, I hosted a virtual town hall with local VA health officials to discuss the VA’s rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines for our nation’s veterans. Officials from the John D. Dingell and Ann Arbor VAs provided critical information for veterans on the current status of their vaccination plans and much more. Visit my Facebook page to watch the virtual event.

MI-12 COVID Testing Sites
The State of Michigan has launched a statewide COVID testing site locator. This tool will help Michiganders search for cost-free testing sites near them. If you or someone you know may have been exposed to COVID, it is important you get tested.

mRNA: The Vaccine Breakthrough

 
At the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, experts warned that we could be years away from an effective vaccine. Despite this warning President Trump confidently stated that a vaccine would be created before the end of 2020. Some of these same experts warned that this wasn’t possible, and the President was mocked for making a promise he surely would not be able to keep. Thanks to Operation Warp Speed and the brilliant minds of the private sector, this promise was kept, and an effective vaccine was created in record time. The technology used in these vaccines, mRNA, is a breakthrough in the medical field and could be used for years to come to treat a wide array of other common and uncommon debilitating diseases.
Messenger Ribonucleic Acid, or mRNA, is the molecule used in COVID-19 vaccines that allows our bodies to trigger an immune response to COVID-19. Traditional vaccines, for example the annual flu vaccine, use a weakened flu germ to trigger an immune response in the body. mRNA vaccines use mRNA to relay instructions to our body to create a protein that triggers an immune response. The benefit of mRNA vaccines over traditional vaccines is that you are not directly injecting a weakened form of the virus into someone. When you get a COVID-19 vaccine, you are never exposed to the virus but will gain an immunity to it. And importantly, mRNA does not interact with our DNA. DNA is stored in our cell nucleus, and mRNA never enters the nucleus. Once the instructions are delivered, the cell breaks down the mRNA and gets rid of it.
The use of mRNA is a medical and technological breakthrough. Its success in treating COVID-19 shows that mRNA is an effective way to fight infectious and debilitating diseases. As mentioned above, one of the many benefits of mRNA is that you do not need to use a weakened germ to trigger an immune response in the body. This means that future mRNA vaccines could be used to provide the body immunity to multiple diseases, significantly decreasing the amount of shots an individual would need to protect against common diseases while never exposing the individual to a weakened form of those diseases. The process for creating effective mRNA vaccines can now take just a few months, instead of years, which could help vaccine developers adapt to seasonal flu strains and dramatically increase their effectiveness.
In addition to treating common vaccine-preventable diseases, mRNA could be a medical breakthrough in treating debilitating and life-threatening diseases such as cancer, sickle-cell disease, and even HIV. In the same way that mRNA provides instructions to the body to create an immune response to COVID-19, scientists are working on ways for mRNA to provide instructions to the body to attack specific cancer cells. While treating diseases like cancer through mRNA will be more complex than treating diseases such as COVID-19 or the flu, mRNA could be a template to treat these deadly diseases.
COVID-19 has been a plague on our country and the world. Thanks to scientific breakthroughs such as the use of mRNA and Operation Warp Speed’s ability to get these vaccines through rigorous testing in record time, we have a safe and effective vaccine to treat COVID-19. Right now, the potential of using mRNA to treat common and uncommon diseases is high, and it could reshape the face of treatment and disease eradication for decades to come. They say ‘follow the science’ and in this case scientific advancements are definitely leading and that is a very good thing.

2/19/21 14:36,Senator Braun's Weekly Update | February 19,"

￼
￼
￼
There hasn't been a lunch rush at the Tavern On South for almost a year.
Business at the downtown Indy restaurant and bar is a fraction of what it was before the pandemic.
Three-fourths of the staff is laid off. Like many other restaurants, government and business loans are keeping it open.
""We are still taking it on the chin,"" said Patrick Tamm, president and CEO Indiana Restaurant and Lodging Association.
Tamm and other restaurant owners met with Indiana Senator Mike Braun Wednesday. Much of the discussion centered on the proposed unified RESTAURANTS Act. It promises $25 billion of federal help, but Braun wants something less expensive and more targeted.
""What we are seeing come from the House is anything but that,"" Braun said. ""It has a lot of other stuff in it."" 
Much is at stake for restaurant workers. Nine out of 10 Indiana restaurants have lost at least one-third of their business, and according the association, have laid off Hoosier 215,000 workers. Nationwide, more than 2,000,000 jobs have been lost.
 
￼
￼
￼
U.S. Sen. Mike Braun, R-Indiana, met with restaurant owners in Indianapolis on Wednesday to talk about raising the minimum wage.
Right now, servers in Indiana make $2.13 an hour, which is more than $5 less than the standard minimum wage of $7.25, because servers' pay also includes tips.
If an employee doesn't make enough in tips to reach minimum wage, the employer has to make up the difference. 
Opponents of a higher minimum wage fear it would eliminate the tax credit for restaurants. Businesses enjoy the tax credit because it lets them count an employee's tip toward their own pay. If menu prices were to go up, owners fear there would be fewer people dining out, resulting in layoffs and closures.
""This would force probably the loss of over 1 million jobs, many of them in the restaurant industry already hard hit,"" he said. ""It doesn't reflect the marketplace.""
Earlier this month, a nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that while raising the minimum wage to $15 by 2025 would increase pay for 17 million workers and pull 900,000 out of poverty, it would also end 1.4 million jobs with employers cutting positions to make up for higher labor costs, according to a report by The Associated Press.
 
 
￼
￼
￼
Speaking to a group of restaurateurs and food service business owners in Fort Wayne on Wednesday, U.S. Sen. Mike Braun made it clear he plans to oppose a proposed $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package. 
“Here every penny is being borrowed from our kids and grandkids. We've already done $4 trillion of it, $1 trillion that has not been spent or obligated, and most of this has nothing to do with helping in a targeted way businesses and employees that have been hurt by COVID.”
Braun was joined by representatives from area restaurants including Casa restaurants, The Hoppy Gnome, Paula's On Main, Cosmo's, Don Hall's restaurants, Mancino's, Banditos and The Copper Spoon.
In particular, Braun said he opposes congressional efforts to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour, something most of the assembled business owners said they are also against. Known as the Raise the Wage Act, the bill would increase the federal minimum wage to $15 over five years. 
Coupled with a proposed repeal of the tip credit, the restaurant owners said they fear their ability to retain quality employees would diminish. The tip credit takes the combination of a tipped employee's base wage and earned tips and compares it to the required minimum wage. If the amount earned through wages and tips is less than the minimum wage, the employer must pay the employee the difference. 
Braun said the current system isn't broken and doesn't need fixing.
“The tipped wage method that restaurants use gives wages way above the average of other areas, sectors of the economy, sometimes even close to double what this proposed minimum wage would do, which would straitjacket business owners, put a ton of fixed costs in place in lieu of what's working,” he said. “It's putting insult on top of injury from what they've already had to deal with from COVID.”
Braun said he favors raising wages by “having businesses that compete well and do it the old-fashioned way.” That was working before the pandemic, Braun said. 
“We were raising wages in some of the most difficult sectors of African American wages, other minorities, and it wasn't being done by paying for it through government,” he said. “I think we need to look hard at what was working before we start entertaining just a barrage of stuff that doesn't make sense.” 
 
￼
￼
￼
Congressional Democrats are not backing off a push to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said last week that the provision raising the minimum wage will be in the next coronavirus relief bill that House Democrats are hoping to send to the Senate in the coming weeks. Pelosi said she was “proud” of the measure saying 27 million people in the US stand to get a raise with the provision with a majority of them being women.
Republicans are scoffing at the measure, one of them Sen. Mike Braun of Indiana, who is saying once again that $15 minimum wage increase makes no economic sense.
“I always prided in raising wages in my own business doing the old fashioned way where you do it through the system,” Braun told Fox Business over the weekend. “It actually was working across the board, pre-COVID, where wages were rising in place they never did before.”  
 
￼
￼
￼
Sen. Mike Braun held a roundtable talk with South Bend area restaurants Thursday to hear their concerns about reopening from the COVID-19 pandemic. But they were looking ahead to something else.
Unlike their Michigan counterparts, they were allowed to reopen months ago. Gov. Eric Holcomb lifted their capacity restrictions Sept. 26 and then on Nov. 11, as virus cases and hospitalizations were rising, the governor said patrons must sit 6 feet apart and mask when not seated.
Gathered at LaSalle Grill, a handful of local restaurant owners, executives and servers told the Indiana Republican that they fear two initiatives pushed by progressive Senate Democrats, raising the federal minimum wage to $15 and eliminating the tip credit for restaurant employees, could further wound them as they try to recover once the pandemic ends.  
 
￼
￼
￼
Small restaurant owners pleaded their concerns about the federal minimum wage potentially being raised to Senator Mike Braun in a round table discussion Wednesday afternoon.
“Raising the minimum wage would put me out of business, it would definitely close me down,” said Tabitha Gray, the owner of Mancino’s Pizza & Grinders on Coliseum Blvd. “They’re going to take me and my small business out of business. So what you’re going to be left with is Burger King and Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.”
The Raise the Wage Act would gradually increase the federal minimum wage from the current $7.25 to $15 per hour over five years. According to the National Restaurant Association, it would also eliminate the tip credit for tipped employees who earn $19-$25 per hour on average.
Senator Braun, who owned a business prior to being a senator, says he will be prominent in speaking up for business owners. He says he’s agrees with raising wages, but doesn’t think the decision should be made by the federal government.
“There are some of us in the Senate, that actually know what matters to business owners and sometimes it’s hard to see where their voices are heard,” said Senator Braun. “Federal Governments have broken institution. When you try to put a one size fits all across the country, it’s going to eliminate over a million jobs.”

Congressman Gosar Statement on the ""Stop Foreign Donations Affecting Our Elections Act""
 
 
WASHINGTON D.C. – Today, U.S. Representative Paul Gosar, D.D.S. (AZ-04) issued the following statement after introducing H.R. 1127, the Stop Foreign Donations Affecting Our Elections Act. This bipartisan legislation eliminates loopholes in the Federal Elections Campaign Act which allows foreign individuals or entities to unlawfully donate to political campaigns online, despite foreign political donations having been outlawed since 1966. 
 
“Debates over campaign finance reform have long permeated our political dialogue, but Americans should not have to worry about illegal foreign donations that have been prohibited by United States law for over half of a century. It is well-documented that online political donations made using a credit card can be exploited to mask tens of millions of foreign campaign donations, and this loophole must be closed. Technology offers great potential for the advancement of democracy, but it can also serve as its Achilles’ heel. Online campaign donations should be strengthened to close loopholes that allow foreign actors the potential to influence American elections. By requiring the disclosure of the Credit Verification Value (CVV) and billing address on all online political campaign donations, we can effectively seal off this loophole to protect the right to utilize the Internet to support political candidates of our choosing while bringing much needed transparency to who is funding our elections,” said Congressman Paul Gosar. 
 
Original Cosponsors: Rep. Don Bacon (NE-02), Rep. Anna Eshoo (CA-18), Rep. Doug Lamborn (CO-05), Rep. Seth Moulton (MA-06), Rep. Louie Gohmert (TX-01), Rep. Mo Brooks (AL-05)
 
Background: 
U.S. campaign laws have barred foreign nationals from influencing our elections through campaign contributions since 1966. Yet, the lack of verification measures when online credit card campaign contributions are made threaten our democracy. Foreign entities should never fund political candidates in this country, however foreign actors have found ways to exploit loopholes in current law. In fact, a 2012 Government Accountability Office report highlighted this risk and found online donation systems to be extremely vulnerable to foreigners attempting to violate federal contribution limits.
 
To close these loopholes and eliminate foreign monetary influence in our elections, this common-sense legislation amends Section 302 of the Federal Elections Campaign Act of 1971 to require both the disclosure of the CVV number printed on the back of a credit card along with the billing address for all online contributions.  Online contributions lacking the CVV number will be prohibited. This commonsense fix to existing law will help ensure that any person making online donations is an American citizen making our electoral system safer and more transparent.

2/19/21 15:34,"PPP Webinar, Bloomfield Small Biz Walk, Washington Update","￼
 
Dear Friends,  As we continue to recognize Black History Month, I went on a small business walk to visit with Black-owned businesses in Bloomfield. Below is a video of our walk and conversations with the owners of Salon Femi, Café Mobay, and Pure Love Pies.
In our ongoing efforts to support local small businesses, my team and I held a webinar this week focused on Paycheck Protection Program loans. Below you will find a recording of the presentation. You will also find an update on my new committee work. 
I continue to hear from constituents and our medical providers about the need for an increased supply of vaccines. I was happy to hear the Biden administration announce this week that they are doubling the number of vaccines distributed to retail pharmacies such as CVS, Walgreens, and Rite Aid, from one million a week to two million. They are also increasing the vaccine supply to states by 13.5 million doses. For more information on how to check your eligibility and how to make an appointment, head to my website, https://sherrill.house.gov/vaccine. 
I also wanted to share an update on my efforts to hold those who took part in the January 6 insurrection on our Capitol accountable. This week, Congresswoman Jackie Speier (D-CA), Congressman Tom Reed (R-NY), Congressman Andrew Garbarino (R-NY), and I introduced the Commission on Domestic Terrorism Act of 2021. This bill would create an independent, bipartisan commission and be modeled after the 9/11 Commission. You can read more about the legislation below.
Stay safe everyone and take care,
￼
Mikie Sherrill

Black History Month Spotlight: Black-Owned Businesses

I joined Mayor Venezia, Commissioner Pomares, and Councilman Joanow last week at Black-owned businesses in Bloomfield as part of our Black History Month celebration. Thanks to Salon Femi, Café Mobay, and Pure Love Pies for talking about your businesses and the impact of COVID. These check-ins with the community are important for my work — at my roundtable last summer with Black small business owners, we discussed the challenges businesses without relationships with large institutional lenders had in accessing the first round of PPP. In December we passed the Economic Aid Act that incorporated a phased reopening of the PPP program by lender type to address this issue.

Small Business Webinar

The coronavirus relief package we passed in December included additional funding for small businesses. This week, my team hosted a webinar on the Paycheck Protection Program with Small Business Association New Jersey District Director Al Titone, the New Jersey’s Bankers Association Executive Vice President and Director of Government Relations Mike Affuso, and the Women’s Center for Entrepreneurship Executive Director Rana Shanawani. Click above to watch the presentation for useful information on federal PPP loans and small business relief.
If you need assistance applying for a PPP loan, please reach out to my office. 

Education and Labor Committee Update
I am happy to announce that I was named to the Higher Education and Workforce Investment Subcommittee on the House Education and Labor Committee. This subcommittee has jurisdiction over education and workforce development beyond the high school level, including the Higher Education Act, adult education, postsecondary career and technical education, apprenticeship programs, science and technology programs, domestic volunteer programs, and national service programs.
Programs that build and support a strong workforce pipeline, connect students with the jobs of today, and ensure Americans have the training they need to adapt to the jobs of tomorrow will help to jumpstart our employment recovery from this pandemic and provide long-term benefits. I am excited to work with my colleagues on the Higher Education and Workforce Investment subcommittee as we get past this pandemic and support getting Americans back to work and our economy back on track.
 
￼
My keynote address to New Jersey community colleges.
  
Community colleges across New Jersey provide an important pathway to education for residents — from first-generation students to those seeking training for a new career. I joined members and students from 16 New Jersey community colleges last week as their keynote speaker. I look forward to working with New Jersey's community college network to help create a strong workforce pipeline for the jobs of today and tomorrow.

￼
My meeting with leaders from independent colleges and universities in NJ.
  
I also met with leaders of independent colleges and universities in NJ-11 and New Jersey to discuss the impact of COVID on their institutions and their students and was excited to talk about serving on the Higher Education & Workforce Investment Subcommittee. Our independent colleges and universities in NJ-11 serve a large number of first-generation and Pell-eligible students, and I appreciate their commitment to supporting their students, especially during this unprecedented time.
  
Armed Services Committee Update  
Picatinny Arsenal is one of our military’s foremost centers of innovation, making key advancements in armaments and munitions. Last week, I was named the Vice Chair of the Tactical Air and Land Subcommittee, which has jurisdiction over Picatinny Arsenal. I look forward to supporting Picatinny as it continues to lead the way in ensuring our service members have the best, most advanced equipment possible.

 January 6 Commission  
In January, I joined colleagues in calling for the creation of an independent, bipartisan commission to investigate the federal government’s failure to appropriately respond to and prevent domestic terrorism and violent extremism. On Thursday, I joined with Representatives Jackie Speier (D-CA), Tom Reed (R-NY), and Andrew Garbarino (R-NY) to introduce the Commission on Domestic Terrorism Act of 2021. 
This bill would create an independent, bipartisan commission and be modeled after the 9/11 Commission. By broadening the investigation beyond the January 6 attack, the commission will be able to conduct a more robust investigation and provide better-informed recommendations to ensure the government is fully equipped to counter and prevent acts of domestic terrorism. Congress must act swiftly to pass this legislation to establish this commission so we can determine exactly how we got to January 6 and how we move forward as a country. Read more here.  
I'm incredibly honored to serve the 11th District and will continue to work hard on the issues that will move New Jersey, and this country, forward.

	•	The Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) recently expanded access to vaccines with a particular focus on rural and underserved areas. TDH is partnering with pharmacies and community health clinics to add more than 100 new vaccination sites across the state. The new vaccination sites for pharmacies can be found here and community health clinics here.

IMPORTANT COVID RELIEF CHECK INFORMATION
If you’re eligible for a COVID stimulus relief check and have not yet received it, it may be because you need to file a 2020 tax return to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit. You have a few options on how to do this, according to the IRS:
	•	You can use one of the IRS Free File partners to electronically file a 2020 tax return and claim your credit; or
	•	In early February, you can use the IRS’ Volunteer Income Tax Return Locator tools to find somewhere local to get free tax help; or
	•	You can file a paper Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR and claim the credit on line 30. The Instructions for Forms 1040 and 1040-SR provide information starting on page 57 on how to compute your credit.

Severe Winter Weather Resources

As temperatures remain low and power outages continue in Texas, my office is in communication with local officials. We're working to help in any way we can. Please reach out if we can be of assistance to you, answer questions, or facilitate information. You can find contact information at the end of this email. 

Since yesterday, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has ordered utility providers across the state—including American Electric Power (AEP)—to begin shedding electricity, and they don’t know when the grid will stabilize. In total, 34,000 megawatts (MW) has been forced off the system since early Monday. Yesterday, ERCOT announced that it was working to restore 2,500 MW of power—serving 500,000 households. 

The ice storm caused a drastic demand in electricity. This demand combined with adverse weather created a strain on the electric grid and caused equipment failures across normal electricity generating sources (i.e. natural gas pipelines freezing up, turbines being frozen, etc.). ERCOT has said that some of the issues with power generation have been rectified so some power should be restored today and tomorrow, hopefully decreasing the number of outages. For instance, South Texas Project (STP) has said that they are trying to get back online this evening. Once AEP receives orders from ERCOT, it will begin restoring power. 

In addition, Governor Abbott issued a disaster declaration in all 254 counties, deployed resources throughout the state, and ordered the Texas State Operations Center to expand its daily operations to 24-hours a day. The White House has issued a Federal Emergency Declaration for Texas in response to the severe winter weather throughout the state. 

Resources and Information:
	•	Be aware of any sources that ask you to text your private account number to them in order to restore power. This is a scam according to ERCOT. 
	•	Call (800) 525-5555 for roadside assistance if you become stranded on the road. You can find road condition updates at DriveTexas.org. 
	•	Follow FEMA Federal Emergency Management Agency for other updates. 
	•	Monitor U.S. National Weather Service (NWS) for winter weather watches, warnings and advisories, and listen to the instructions of your local officials. 
	•	If you have power, keep your usage low and if you don’t, unplug all major appliances until you get it.
	•	You can also keep warm by closing the blinds and curtains, stuffing towels or rags in cracks under doors to prevent the loss of heat, and bundling up. 
	•	Keep indoor space heaters at least three feet from other items.
	•	Place generators outdoors and away from windows, keep them dry and properly grounded, and never plug them into a wall outlet or main electrical panel.
	•	A boil water notice is currently in effect for Nueces County.

Seeking Applicants for the Gold Star Family Fellowship Program
 
 
 
 
To give one’s life in service to our country is the greatest sacrifice an American can make. As a nation, we will never fully be able to show our gratitude to these men and women and the families they leave behind. We owe our Gold Star Families a debt that can never be repaid. 

Congress has identified a new way to serve these families and express our thanks through the creation of the Gold Star Family Fellowship program. This year-long paid fellowship was created recently as a way of giving back to those directly affected by the loss of a servicemember. 

﻿We are looking for an individual to take part in this career opportunity. 
If you are a Gold Star Family member, have a high school diploma or higher, and are interested in expanding your career, I would encourage you to apply. We are filling the position in either my Corpus Christi or Victoria office. 

As issues are debated and legislation is weighed in Washington, this program is one way Congress is recognizing the voices of Gold Star Families. It is our goal to help and in a small way say thank you.

Urging the Biden Administration to Secure the Southern Border
 
 
 
 
On Wednesday, Corpus Christi Border Patrol Station agents arrested a MS-13 gang member who was here illegally in Refugio. In addition to being a gang member, the subject has criminal convictions for carrying a concealed weapon, trespassing, and was previously ordered removed from the country in 2005.

Our Border Patrol agents continue to safeguard our communities and the entire nation. But the spread of the coronavirus and President Biden's harmful border security policies have not deterred cartel activity and migrants from crossing our borders. 

I sent a letter to President Biden today urging him to reverse his decision on banning deportations, restart construction of the border wall, and keep the successful Migrant Protection Protocols, all of which deter mass migration and mitigate cartel profits. We must do everything we can to prevent another surge at the southern border like our country experienced in summer 2019.
 

Meeting with Caldwell County Leadership
 
 
 
 
I had the pleasure of eating BBQ in Lockhart and hearing the many great projects that are in the works for Caldwell County. Seated squarely in the innovation belt, Caldwell County is producing many innovative projects. These range from artificial intelligence to agriculture to construction and many more. The opportunities in Caldwell County are endless with the resources and leadership available. 

Infrastructure is key to the development of our nation and the success of our communities. I’m constantly make an effort to ensure communication between our counties and the federal government to ensure they have the resources they need to succeed.
 

In Other News:

	•	The Texas Agriculture Task Force in the U.S. Congress recently named me a leader and co-chair. The Task Force promotes and champions federal policies that strengthen Texas agriculture and rural communities and engages producer groups and other key stakeholders in the state. In this new Congress, the group will also develop pro-agriculture strategies in trade, taxation, rural development, environmental regulation, rural broadband and the 2023 Farm Bill, advocate to the USDA, EPA and other agencies within the Biden Administration, and work closely with other members of Congress and the top Republican of the House Agriculture Committee Rep. G.T. Thompson. I look forward to representing farmers and ranchers from our part of Texas on this important Task Force. Our collective goals include standing up for the interests of the Texas agriculture community in Congress, boosting the voice of rural Texas in policy development, and securing innovative solutions for Texas producers. 
 



God Bless,

Press Release: Rep. Loudermilk on GameStop Trading Issue: More Regulations are Not the Answer
 
 
Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga) had the following exchange Thursday with the witnesses at the House Financial Services Committee hearing entitled, “Game Stopped? Who Wins and Loses When Short Sellers, Social Media, and Retail Investors Collide.”

Rep Loudermilk: “Mr. Tenev, can you remind us why Robinhood temporarily paused trading of GameStop and other stocks?”

Mr. Tenev: “Of course, thank you, Congressman. Robinhood paused trading temporarily, or I should say paused buying of about thirteen securities, on Thursday so that we could meet our regulatory deposit and collateral requirements.” 

Rep. Loudermilk: “So what you’re saying is, you paused because you had to comply with regulations. Is that true?""

Mr. Tenev: “Correct.”

2/19/21 16:38,Getting Us Through This Crisis,"￼

February 19, 2021
Dear Lindsey,
 
This week, I continued my efforts to help get our community through this crisis and emerge stronger on the other side. I was excited to announce a new, federally-run mass vaccination site coming to our community and took action to co-sponsor legislation that will strengthen our economy and create jobs.
 
 Mass Vaccination Site 
	•	
￼
 
Our path out of this crisis is through the COVID-19 vaccine—and the faster we can get it into the arms of Americans, the faster we can begin to recover, rebuild, and revitalize our communities. That is why I was so pleased to help announce that a federal mass vaccination site will be coming to our community. With the capacity to vaccinate an additional 1,000 people per day, this site will accelerate our recovery and bring us closer to a return to normalcy.
 
Furthermore, this location helps to ensure equity for underserved neighborhoods that have been disproportionately impacted by this health crisis. I’m grateful to President Biden and Governor Cuomo for their leadership to bring this site to Rochester and I look forward to continuing our work together to accelerate the vaccination process and ensure the American people have the relief and support they deserve.

 Workforce Development 
 
With unemployment at record levels and the pandemic continuing to halt our economy, now is the time to make bold investments that will uplift families, create jobs, and get American workers back on their feet.That is why I announced my co-sponsorship of the Relaunching America's Workforce Act, legislation that would invest $15 billion in workforce development programs and expand support for workers displaced by the pandemic.
 
Specifically, this legislation would: 
	•	Provide over $11 billion to the state and local public workforce system to support dislocated workers, employers, youth, and adults who are seeking jobs;
	•	Invest $1 billion in expanding the capacity of adult education providers to serve adults with low-literacy levels who have been negatively impacted by the economic consequences of the COVID-19 national emergency, including $100 million reserved for adult education in correctional facilities;
	•	Invest $1 billion in high-quality, work-based learning opportunities and career and technical education to prepare students for careers in high-skill, high-wage, or in-demand industry sectors and occupations;
	•	Invest $2 billion to restart the community college career training grant program, which was initiated during the last recession to help employers find talent in their local area, and provide individuals with career pathways to high-skill, high-wage, and in-demand employment opportunities.

 Open Enrollment 
 
With COVID-19 continuing to impact our community, it is more important than ever to get the healthcare coverage you need. That is why here in New York and across our country, we have extended the deadline to access care.

WEEKLY UPDATE
February 19th, 2021
￼
￼
￼
￼
Dear Kansas friends, 

Thank you for your interest in receiving my newsletter. Please feel free to share this with your friends and family.

It’s well past time that we reign in Washington and make government accountable again. As your Congressman, I will be a leader in making that happen.

Democrats Advance $350 Billion Liberal State Bailout

The Oversight and Reform markup made clear that Democrats have no interest in working with Republicans to deliver a bipartisan package. Instead, they chose to ram this legislation through without any real reflection and debate. Congress has already created and appropriated $150 billion to the Coronavirus Relief Fund through the CARES Act for state and local governments. Even though a significant portion of that original $150 billion has not been spent, Democrats just approved sending another additional $350 billion. As a result of this horribly misguided action, Kansas taxpayers will be forced to bail out liberal states who severely mismanaged their own budgets even before the pandemic began – this is deeply wrong.
￼
￼

Holding The Biden Administration Accountable

I am an original cosponsor on a resolution that requires President Biden provide a full accounting of unspent COVID-19 stimulus. The wellbeing and security of Kansans is my priority. However, solutions today should not cause tomorrow’s problems. In the case of this unchecked spending, we are on a dangerous path with an unsustainable fiscal crisis looming.  

The Biden Administration’s almost $2 trillion spending bill would be the largest stimulus package in American history and comes less than two months after Congress passed a bipartisan $900 billion COVID-19 relief package. Combined with previously enacted stimulus legislation, the Biden bailout plan would bring total COVID-19 spending to almost $6 trillion. This amounts to:
	•	over $17,000 per person; $69,000 for a family of four. 
	•	more than the GDP of every country other than China and the United States. 
 
Existing estimates show roughly $1 trillion in enacted but unspent COVID-19 stimulus funding. The Congressional Budget Office issued a report earlier this month projecting that the U.S. economy will return to pre-pandemic levels of growth in real gross domestic product by the middle of this year, absent any further stimulus spending like what has been proposed by the Biden Administration and Congressional Democrats. 
￼
￼

Ash Wednesday marked the beginning of the Lenten season. For millions of Christians, this is a time for repentance and to rededicate ourselves to our faith. May we all grow closer to God during this holy season.
￼

I was first introduced to Rush Limbaugh when I was helping my dad build houses as a kid. We would roll the windows down in our truck and blast Rush’s show on KZRG. He left an indelible mark on our country, helping to shape the modern conservative movement over decades. He is a legend who will not be forgotten. May God bless his wife Kathryn and the rest of his family. 

Rest In Peace, Rush.

Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 2.19.21
Friday, February 19, 2021 –                                 
Bring Back Medical Supply Manufacturing to America
We rely on medical supplies – from prescription drugs to hospital machines to personal protective equipment (PPE) – for our personal health and wellness. They are made for that purpose. But making medical supplies in the United States benefits our national health – the American economy, job growth, and ability to respond adequately to emergencies.
The coronavirus pandemic has revealed some uncomfortable truths about medical supply chains. Too many of the supplies we need are made in foreign countries. A crisis such as a natural disaster can interrupt the manufacture of these supplies there and their import here.
Further, some of these countries are not our friends. Prior to COVID-19, China exported almost half of the word’s PPE, according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The Subcommittee on Health I serve on heard testimony before the pandemic about China’s dominance in other areas, such as penicillin or the blood thinner heparin.
The Chinese Communist Party’s (CCP) pattern of behavior on the global stage, including its actions throughout the pandemic, indicates that it should not be trusted. Even before the pandemic, concerns existed about the safety and quality of medical supplies provided by China. During the pandemic, the CCP required U.S. companies based in China to make PPE and then hoarded it when other countries also needed the equipment.
Both the Trump and Biden Administrations have invoked the Defense Production Act to increase domestic production of PPE and other medical equipment. Other companies, including several in Virginia’s Ninth Congressional District, have voluntarily converted manufacturing from their usual products to those most needed during the pandemic. For example, textile manufacturers have shifted to making masks and gowns, and whiskey distillers have used their facilities to produce hand sanitizer.
It has been encouraging to see Americans apply their ingenuity and dedication to meeting the needs of the present crisis. We have risen to this challenge.
In the long term, the challenge to be met is ensuring that Americans need not depend on foreign countries for our medical essentials.
I raised some points on this issue at a Subcommittee on Health hearing on February 3.
To start, I asked witnesses about the ideal percentage of our medical supplies that should be manufactured here. The United States does not have to achieve complete self-sufficiency, but it should strive to manufacture enough here so that we are not subject to the mercy of any single other country.
Just as the United States should not overly depend on one country for these supplies, we should not depend on one part of the country.
The aftermath of Hurricane Maria in 2017 is instructive. The storm inflicted great devastation on Puerto Rico, where a substantial amount of U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturing takes place. It knocked out a manufacturer of saline bags, causing a shortage of this essential product in U.S. hospitals for months.
Any strategy for increasing medical supply manufacturing in the United States must account for a similar scenario and build in geographical diversity so one disaster does not cut off supply. I’ll advocate for the Ninth District to be one of those sites, but we can also think about the broader United States – not just our states but territories such as Puerto Rico.
If medical supply chains return to the United States, a further issue to consider is having a dependable market. One of the issues we face now amid the pandemic is having to scale up production of supplies to fit the great need that exists. They won’t always be in such high demand, but it will be important to maintain manufacturing capacity to increase production if demand rises again in the future.
Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle want to tackle this important subject, and I believe we can do it. For our health, well-being, economic growth, and national security, we must do it.

Foxx Report
 
Hardworking families across America are downright fed up, and they have every right to be. For more than a year, students have been stuck at home and have been robbed of the valuable time they could have been spending alongside their peers and teachers in the classroom. What’s even more infuriating is that the American people have heard nothing but contradictions from the Biden Administration concerning the safe reopening of schools. While the mainstream media and political pundits inside Washington spin endless stories on safely reopening schools – often skewing the truth to fit their own narrative – the facts have been abandoned yet again. For this week’s newsletter, I’m going to set the record straight, provide you with the information that’s been left out, and expose the truth. You deserve to know.

A “Mistake In Communications”
Earlier this week, Joe Biden held a televised town hall on CNN where he covered a wide range of issues – one being safely reopening schools. In this town hall, he openly admitted that his administration miscommunicated its approach to get students safely back in the classroom. You would think that this miscommunication would have been immediately corrected so that the American people would get the truth, but as of now we have seen little to no action in doing so. As you may recall, I touched on the issue of this blatant lapse in leadership in my newsletter to you last week. Here’s an excerpt:
“On Tuesday, Jen Psaki, the White House Press Secretary announced that the Biden Administration’s goal as of now is to have students return to classrooms for “at least one day a week” in his first 100 days in office. But Psaki commented that the goal of having in-person classes one day a week was simply a, “…bar we are trying to leap over.”
In fact, his Administration decided to double-down on that goal – not even realizing that they’ve misled countless families that are crying out for help. What was not admitted publicly, with pure accountability and transparency in mind, was that this approach was more so of an appeal to powerful teachers’ unions and not to parents and students. Think about that for a second. What does that tell you about this Administration’s priorities? Are families and students being put first? No. What about the teachers who have been so vocal about having their students return to the classroom safely? No. This is purely a ploy to score political points and appease far-left allies while leaving America’s families in the dark.
Where Will All The Money Go?
The second part of the story lies within the halls of Congress. The $1.9 trillion so-called “relief package” that’s being rammed through both the House and Senate is not providing immediate, targeted relief to schools. In fact, it’s delaying the bulk of funding until beyond 2023. This is another important fact that’s being obscured behind partisan talking points. Not to mention, over $1 trillion of previously appropriated funds from last year’s relief packages has yet to be spent. As the saying goes, “the devil is in the details”. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported that this $1.9 trillion so-called “relief package” allocates, “$128.6 billion for the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund for preparation for, prevention of, and response to the coronavirus pandemic or for other uses allowed by other federal education programs.” Another key fact: that $128.6 billion will not be sent out until after October of this year or even later.
Now, you tell me, does this respect hardworking families, students and teachers? If you answered no, you’re right. Do Washington Democrats really believe that parents should wait until two years from now to send their children back to school? Well, based off their plan, and the fine print in their behemoth of a “relief package”, it’s rather evident. Republicans in Congress, since the very beginning of the pandemic, have had a rock-solid focus of helping the millions of families caught in the middle of this shameful debacle. But we’re not the only ones who are vocal. Parents, state legislators, teachers, and countless other groups have pushed back and are demanding that action be taken immediately – not suppressed by breathless talking points that only bury the facts even more. 
Shifting The Blame 
As you may expect, the mainstream media decided to weigh in and they’ve made false claims about Republicans criticizing the Biden Administration’s lack of a response. In an article posted in Politico this week, there was a misleading claim that Republicans have made, “no commitment to meaningfully engage on policy proposals” to reopen schools. What a joke. But let’s unpack this further. The truth is that we have. Just last week in the Education and Labor Committee, Republicans offered five commonsense proposals to reopen schools safely and they were all blocked by committee Democrats. Here’s a synopsis:
	•	Representative Rick Allen (R-GA) proposed an amendment requiring K-12 school districts to offer in-person instruction if they receive COVID relief funds.
	•	Representative Greg Murphy (R-NC) proposed an amendment requiring schools to serve high-risk students if they receive COVID relief funds.
	•	Representative Michelle Steel (R-CA) offered an amendment requiring schools reopen if teachers have had access to the COVID-19 vaccine.
	•	Representative Mary Miller (R-IL) offered an amendment putting COVID relief funds into education savings accounts for parents to use to pay for education if their children’s public schools are closed.
	•	Representative Bob Good (R-VA) offered an amendment to increase transparency of school reopening negotiations between school districts and teachers’ unions.
All these amendments were blocked by committee Democrats. Yet, Republicans are the ones who are being accused of not “meaningfully engaging”? The mainstream media should sit this one out if they really are that disillusioned. 
The Bottom Line  While Joe Biden and his Administration are frantically searching for the newest messaging tactic that will recalibrate an already bungled approach, the reality is that the facts of this whole situation do not lie. What the American people have seen to date is nothing more than an abdication of leadership from the White House in such a critical time for the country. Mixed messages, faulty policy priorities, a hack job of a so-called “relief package”, and a lack of following the science of safely reopening schools just goes to show that this Administration has no idea what it’s doing. I’ll offer a piece of advice to Joe Biden: If your goal is to get students back safely into the classroom and help countless parents in this country, give them the facts, own up to your own failures and actually work with Republicans to achieve progress. As of now, those two things have not happened, and I suspect you won’t hear about that at all from him.
In Congress, Republicans have made our position clear countless times: delays in education are hurting our nation’s future leaders. The more that time is wasted, the more that students and families suffer. We’ve worked tirelessly to reiterate this point to our Democrat colleagues, but they’ve chosen not to heed our calls. We stand at the ready with policy proposals that will solve this issue and alleviate the stress felt by so many hardworking families during this time. But most importantly, we don’t look down at talking points to make our case, we look to the facts and the evidence that has been made clear. This is not a partisan issue in the slightest, and its one that we see as a critical issue of our time. 
Despite the obstruction, the mixed messages, and the disillusionment that has clouded Washington as of late, Republicans won’t back down in our work until all students can safely return to the classroom. Their future success depends on it, and we will not let silence and inaction prevail.
Have a blessed weekend.
Sincerely,
￼

2/19/21 17:01,Getting Back On Track,"￼

February 19, 2021
  
Hello friends,
 This week brought progress and steps forward in our response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Biden-Harris administration announced a more than 20% increase in COVID-19 vaccine supply for states, with more than 13.5 million doses being distributed across the country this week. This announcement is a hopeful reminder that there is a light at the end of the tunnel. While we continue working to get the COVID-19 vaccines into the arms of Granite Staters, we all have a role to play in slowing the spread of COVID-19.
  
￼
The sun is shining after an ice storm in N.H.
  
Although we have a lot of work ahead to put this pandemic behind us, I am hopeful for the future. On the list of things I am looking forward to, I am excited to announce the start of my 2021 Winter Photo Contest! If you live in New Hampshire’s Second Congressional District and enjoy photography, I invite you to submit up to five of your favorite photos to my 2021 Winter Photo Contest to highlight the Granite State's natural beauty!
 
From now through Monday, March 1st at 11:59 PM, my office is accepting submissions of images/scenery in the Second Congressional District. For more information about the competition and the timeline for submissions, head to my website!
  
  
 
Working with the Biden Administration
 
  
￼
In Congress, I’m focused on building the clean energy economy of the future.
  
On Thursday in the Energy and Commerce Committee on the Energy Subcommittee, I questioned energy professionals about how we can promote innovative, creative efforts to build a clean energy economy, transition to net-zero carbon emissions, and remove carbon from our atmosphere. This hearing came a week after the Biden administration announced up to $100 million in funding for transformative clean energy technology research and development. And today, the U.S. rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement. Promoting and pursuing these advancements in Congress alongside the White House will help create high-quality jobs in New Hampshire and across the country and benefit not only our planet but also our economy and our communities. For the good of our public health, our planet, and our economy, we must take bold action to invest in a clean energy future. I will continue working, through my role on the Energy and Commerce and Agriculture Committees, to build the clean energy economy of the future.
  
  
￼
In Congress, I’m working to ensure the efficient, equitable distribution of the COVID vaccines.
  
One of our best tools against COVID-19 is the safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines.  It was a tremendous scientific feat for the vaccines to be developed so quickly, and as our nation works to get them equitably and efficiently distributed, sufficient supply is crucial. Last week, the Biden administration announced they had acquired an additional 200 million vaccine doses, and this week the administration announced a more than 20% increase in COVID-19 vaccine supply for states, with more than 13.5 million doses now being distributed across the country each week. This significant progress in our efforts to get vaccines into arms offers hope and a light at the end of the tunnel. I will continue working on the Energy and Commerce Committee to ramp-up our ability to quickly manufacture, distribute, and administer vaccines so that we can get them into arms and crush the pandemic as soon as possible.
  
￼
I will continue working to ensure every Granite Stater has a safe place to call home.
  
This week, I joined the New Hampshire delegation in writing a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urging the Biden administration to provide as much flexibility as possible when defining eligible expenses to allow grantees to maximize the impact of ERA funds as they combat the growing affordable housing crisis. The number of families experiencing housing insecurity is increasing and our homeless shelters have been forced to open up additional locations to safely accommodate the growing demand for beds while abiding by social distancing protocols, now is not the time for a narrow interpretation of how ERA funds can be put to use. This letter comes the same week the Biden administration announced an extension of the eviction moratorium and mortgage forbearance through June 2021. No one should have to worry about keeping a roof over their head, and I will continue working in Congress and with the Biden-Harris administration to ensure every Granite Stater has a safe place to call home.
  
 
Hope on the Homefront
 
  
￼
I’m proud to support our brave Granite State firefighters.
  
On Thursday, I was proud to help announce that Granite State fire departments will receive more than $100K in CARES Act funding from FEMA to support PPE and disinfectant purchases. Our brave firefighters are on the frontlines of the COVID-19 health crisis, and they put their own safety and wellbeing at risk to protect our communities – we must do everything we can to keep them out of harm’s way. This federal CARES Act funding will help ensure that New Hampshire’s firefighters have the essential PPE and disinfectant supplies they need to safely do their jobs as they work to support our communities during the COVID-19 public health crisis. I will continue my efforts in Congress to ensure our firefighters and first responders have the resources and support to continue their important work.
  
￼
Proud to announce that NH will receive more than $1 million to support affordable housing.
  
Every Granite Stater needs access to a safe place to live, especially during the COVID-19 public health crisis. On Wednesday, I was proud to help announce that New Hampshire will receive more than $1,000,000 to support affordable housing and community development efforts. This funding will help support struggling individuals and families, create much-needed new jobs, foster healthy communities, and advance our ongoing efforts to ensure every Granite Stater has a roof over their head and a place to call home. I will continue working in Congress to provide support for those who need it most in New Hampshire as we work to get through this pandemic.
 As we continue working to get vaccines into arms in New Hampshire, the Manchester VA has vaccinated hundreds of eligible Granite State veterans. More doses are on the way to New Hampshire, and ongoing efforts to get vaccines into arms as quickly and efficiently as possible will be crucial as we work to crush this pandemic. And as of this week, nearly 5% of New Hampshire’s population is fully vaccinated. Although we have a long way to go before the vaccine is available to every Granite Stater who wants it, this is a hopeful sign as we continue working to crush this pandemic.
  
 
News You Can Use
 
  
￼
I will continue working in Congress to protect and educate citizens to stop preventable CO deaths.
  
The extreme winter weather and power outages in Texas and across the country are a sad reminder of the danger of carbon monoxide poisoning. Be sure you understand the risks and warning signs, and ways to keep you and your loved ones safe during the cold winter months. Congress must do more to protect and educate citizens to stop preventable deaths from this odorless, colorless gas. I look forward to re-introducing the Zachary and Nicholas Burt Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act to create a new grant program to educate the public about carbon monoxide poisoning and install detectors in homes and public buildings to protect our nation’s most vulnerable citizens.
  
￼
Make sure you are covered during the COVID-19 public health crisis.
  
The Biden-Harris administration has opened a special health insurance enrollment period for the Affordable Care Act Marketplace. Access to quality, affordable health insurance is crucial, especially in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, but this public health and economic crisis has left many families and individuals without coverage. If you need to sign up or make changes to your existing plan, visit www.HealthCare.Gov before May 15.

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a major effect on our lives. Many of us are facing challenges that can be stressful, overwhelming, and cause strong emotions in adults and children. You are not alone. Mental Health and Substance Use support and treatment are available to you even during the state of emergency. You can call 2-1-1 to be directed to help. If you are already connected to a treatment provider, stay in touch with them. If your provider has closed, you can call your local Community Mental Health Center. The CDC also offers mental health resources.

Sign-ups for Phase 1B of New Hampshire’s COVID-19 vaccination process are now open. Phase 1B opens vaccine registration to:

—Those 65 years or older
—Those under 65 but medically vulnerable
—Residents or staff of residential facilities
—Correctional officers working in facilities 

Confirm your eligibility and register for your vaccination on www.vaccines.nh.gov/. If you need assistance, you can call 2-1-1 for help. 

As always, the CDC and the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services are the best resources to turn to during the COVID-19 public health emergency. If you are sick, stay home and call your health care provider. If you live in NH and have questions about coronavirus, dial 211 or visit CDC.gov for more information.

To stay updated on my work in Congress and around the Granite State, as well as for important information and resources, like my page on Facebook and follow me on Twitter. 

As we continue working to protect ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities during COVID-19, remember that hope and brighter days are on the way! We’re all in this together, and we will come out stronger on the other side. I hope you have a safe and fun weekend!
 
Sincerely, 

Annie

Week in Review


 
DOJ Must Investigative NYS’s Disastrous Nursing Home Policy  
 
New York State’s handling of nursing home deaths represents a massive breach in public trust. Hundreds of families across New York State lost loved ones as a direct result of the State’s disastrous nursing home policy. Reporting now shows the Cuomo Administration deliberately withheld this critical information from federal authorities. The individuals responsible for perpetuating this coverup must be held accountable, which is why I’m calling on the Department of Justice to open an obstruction of justice investigation into Governor Andrew Cuomo and his administration.

Leading Effort to Ensure Vaccines Reach Underserved Communities in CNY
 
The CDC and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announced they will supply select Federally Qualified Health Center Programs (FQHCs) with COVID-19 vaccines. To ensure vaccines reach underserved communities in Central New York, I urged the agencies to include Syracuse Community Health Center, Inc. and East Hill Medical Center in the program. With a combined 28 locations which serve thousands of underserved Central New Yorkers, both of these community health centers are uniquely positioned to rectify the vaccine disparity in our region.

Sounding the Alarm on Biden’s Immigration Plan
 
The Biden immigration bill makes no substantial improvements to border security and fails to close loopholes in our current immigration system. Protecting the sovereignty of our territorial borders should not be controversial, and yet the President has sought politically-expedient solutions. Most of the ‘border security’ provisions in this proposal require the Department of Homeland Security to develop plans and strategies that have already been required by Congress or already exist. Ultimately, this plan falls flat and reveals the Administration’s true intent of a complete shift toward open borders. As the Lead Republican of the Committee on Homeland Security, I welcome an honest policy discussion about the changes Congress needs to make to secure the border.

Pregnant Workers Fairness Act Reintroduced
 
Simply put, no mother or mother-to-be in this country should have to choose between being a parent and keeping their job. Unfortunately, current federal law lacks adequate protections to ensure pregnant workers are able to remain healthy in the workplace. That’s why, I reintroduced the Pregnant Workers Fairness Act. This bipartisan effort puts in place a uniform, fair and familiar framework for employers and will enable women to keep working safely and provide for their families throughout pregnancy.

Update on Sustained Lake Ontario Flood Risks
 
I spoke with the International Joint Commission (IJC) to bring attention to the continued threat flooding poses to communities across Lake Ontario and to discuss their flood mitigation plans for 2021. With water levels on Lakes Superior, Michigan, Huron, and Erie all above historic averages, significant inflows from those lakes has the potential to exacerbate hazardous conditions on Lake Ontario. I’m continuing to urge the IJC to prioritize the needs of coastal communities in their water level management strategies and requesting that they work closely with our Canadian partners to help move necessary coastal resiliency efforts forward. I remain resolute in my belief that Plan 2014 is not working for our shorelines and that water level management procedures must be reformed to prioritize the needs of our riparian communities.

Legislative Update: Three Bills to Expand Access to Treatment for Mental Illness & Substance Use Disorders
 
In Central New York, we’re seeing the ongoing pandemic contribute to rising rates of mental illness and suicide as well as substance use disorders and overdose deaths. Our community is facing a crisis and we must devote the time, resources, and attention to these issues. In Congress, I’m continuing to prioritize increasing access to mental healthcare and substance use disorder support services amid the ongoing pandemic by reintroducing three meaningful pieces of legislation. My bills would work to expand treatment options in our region and ensure Central New Yorkers of all ages have access to the support they need during these difficult times.

Named to Three Subcommittees Critical to Addressing CNY Infrastructure Needs
 
Infrastructure is an area where I know we can find bipartisan compromise, and I was recently named to the Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, the Subcommittee on Aviation, and the Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment. Importantly, these subcommittees will allow me to continue working on efforts that support the I-81 rebuild, keep our aviation systems safe, and address our vast water infrastructure needs in Central New York.

Strong Opposition to a Renewed Nuclear Deal with Iran 
 
Under no circumstance can we allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. The previous Administration took strong action to hold Iran accountable for its illicit behavior and rightfully withdrew from the Iran Nuclear Deal. By offering to restart nuclear talks with Iran, the Biden Administration is seeking to placate the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism and failing to prioritize American security interests. This is a time for strength, not weakness. Any move by the Biden Administration to provide sanctions relief to Iran would be a historic mistake that repeats failed appeasement attempts of the past. As Iran continues to target our critical infrastructure and seeks to exert foreign influence in our elections, this Committee will stand strong to combat nation state aggression and protect the homeland.

Friends,

The Biden Administration continues promoting dangerous policies that will have severe consequences for Wyoming workers and families. In his first month in office, President Biden has signed a number of executive orders aimed at fulfilling far-left campaign promises instead of putting American workers and families first. Now more than ever, I will continue to push back against the Democrats' socialist agenda and stand up for the freedoms and values that Americans and Wyoming hold dear. 
Legislation Prohibiting Coal, Oil and Gas Leasing Moratoriums: 
To combat the President's dangerous executive orders banning new leasing and permitting on federal land, I introduced two pieces of legislation to safeguard against them. I introduced ""The Safeguarding Oil and Gas Leasing and Permitting Act"" and, ""The Safeguarding Coal Leasing Act"" to prohibit any moratorium on federal oil and gas leasing or permitting or coal leasing unless a joint resolution of approval is enacted by Congress.

These bills protect states like Wyoming from Biden's damaging orders, and prevent the job loss, higher energy costs, and loss of revenue that promises to come with them. These bills will defend the interests of the people of Wyoming and our nation, and I will work with partners in Washington to push for their consideration.

I am pleased to have the support of Governor Mark Gordon, the Petroleum Association of Wyoming, the Wyoming Mining Association, the Independent Petroleum Association of America (IPAA), and a number of my House Republican colleagues in combatting the Biden Administration's extreme agenda. 
Calling On Biden To Revoke Leasing & Permitting Moratoriums: 
I joined House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), House Republican Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) and 17 other House Republican leaders in sending a letter to President Joe Biden asking him to revoke the energy moratorium his Administration issued that would prevent leasing and permitting on federal land for 60-days.

The full letter can be seen here or read below: 
￼ 
￼ 
￼ 
￼ 
Standing Up For Local Interests In NEPA Decision Making: 
I recently introduced ""The Recognizing Local Interests in NEPA Decision Making Act,"" legislation providing that any proceeding for judicial review on the basis of compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) can only be brought in the state where the action is proposed or permitted to take place, or in Washington D.C.

NEPA analysis is a required part of the approval process for a large range of permitted activities on federal lands, from grazing leases to oil and gas project proposals. Sadly, extremist environmental groups are delaying projects that are important to Wyoming and the country by ""venue shopping,"" filing NEPA compliance suits in liberal courts to gain favorable decisions.

Activist judges, trial lawyers, and radical environmentalists should not be able to prevent Wyoming communities from utilizing local resources as they see fit to create good-paying jobs and improve local economies, and this legislation will stop that practice.

I am glad to have the backing of Governor Gordon, the Wyoming Stock Growers Association, the Wyoming Mining Association, the Wyoming County Commissioners Association, the Petroleum Association of Wyoming, and several of my Republican colleagues in the House. 

I will always fight to keep these radical groups and liberal judges from telling Wyoming how to utilize our local resources. 
Legislation to Authorize Construction and Operation of the Keystone XL Pipeline: 
I joined Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-ND), House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA), House Republican Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA) and 82 of my House Republican colleagues in introducing the ""Keystone XL Pipeline Construction and Jobs Preservation Act."" This legislation authorizes the construction and operation of the Keystone XL Pipeline and declares that a Presidential permit is not required. This legislation follows President Biden’s decision to rescind the border crossing permit. 

The Keystone XL Pipeline is expected to provide approximately 11,000 jobs and up to 60,000 indirect and supporting jobs, generate tax revenue, decrease our reliance on foreign energy, and strengthen American national security and energy independence.

The Keystone XL Pipeline is crucial not just for our energy industry and our economy, but for our national security interests as well. It’s devastating that President Biden would cancel the continued construction of this pipeline, which will destroy thousands of jobs, increase energy costs, and make our nation more dependent on our adversaries for important resources that we need. As our economy rebounds, we need to be doing everything possible to create quality jobs for families, while reducing the burdens they face when it comes to the cost of energy. Continuing the construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline is an important way for us to do that.

I am glad to join my colleagues in introducing this bill, and I encourage all members of Congress – including Democrats – who support good-paying union jobs, lower energy costs, and efforts to allow the United States to maintain our energy independence to support this legislation so that construction of this pipeline can continue. 
Fighting For Rural Wyoming: 
I am proud to announce that I have been named to the Executive Committee of the Congressional Western Caucus for the 117th Congress. The Western Caucus advocates on behalf of key issues that impact Wyoming and the West. Through this role, I look forward to continuing to stand up for Wyoming’s rural communities by ensuring our priorities are at the forefront of every debate. 

Under the Democrats' regime, rural America has come under attack. House Democrats continue to advance policies that increase the size and scope of the federal government, limit domestic energy production, infringe on Constitutional rights, expand federal land, and leave rural America behind. We cannot let that happen. I look forward to working with Representative Dan Newhouse, chair of the Western Caucus, and all our members as we fight for our Wyoming way of life. 
Biden Executive Orders Endanger Wyoming’s Economy And Our National Security: 
President Biden signed executive orders issuing a moratorium on new oil and gas leasing and permitting on federal land for one year, and a moratorium on new coal leasing and permitting on federal land for three years. These moves by the Biden Administration will endanger the Wyoming economy and threaten our national security. 

This real and painful ban will be felt across the country, but especially here in Wyoming. Energy costs will rise, domestic energy production will fall, and jobs will be lost. Additionally, energy states like Wyoming with large amounts of federal land will lose out on critical education, infrastructure, and healthcare resources, and those who can least afford it will bear the brunt of this decision. The decision also diminishes our ability to produce energy domestically and maintain energy independence, forcing us to rely on our adversaries which undermines our national security interests.

According to Julian Balow, the Wyoming Superintendent of Public Instruction, this order will eliminate $150M/year in resources that fund K-12 education in the state. Also, a study by the University of Wyoming finds that an oil and gas moratorium could result in losses of up to $2B in tax revenue over 4 years, around 18,000 jobs, and billions in wages. 

While we continue fighting COVID-19, the decision to cut off a major lifeline that Americans have relied on to survive during this time is reckless and irresponsible. We should be expanding opportunities for energy production and economic success, not eliminating them.  
Devastating Consequences Of The Biden Agenda: 
In January, the acting Interior Secretary, Scott de la Vega, issued an order prohibiting local BLM offices from leasing and permitting for 60 days. The order is misguided and will have severe consequences for Wyoming. We need to be doing everything possible to support our energy producers and our economy, however, the administration's decision will negatively impact so many hard-working families who rely on the national treasures in Wyoming to make a living.

I will continue to fight tooth and nail for the interests of our energy industry, and will stand with our partners in Wyoming to use all the available tools to challenge this illogical order and future ones like it. 
Warning Of The Coming Border Crisis: 
Last week, I joined 51 of my House Republican colleagues in sending a letter to President Joe Biden warning him about the growing crisis on America’s southern border and calling on him to direct the Department of Homeland Security to immediately brief members of Congress on steps being taken to address this issue. 

The letter opens with a rundown of recent data from the southern border which includes soaring daily apprehensions, and explains how the recent executive orders signed by the President are aimed at “dismantling the security of our borders,” instead of stopping the flow of illegal migration. The full letter can be read here and seen below:  
￼ 
￼ 
Protecting Our Second Amendment Rights: 
I co-sponsored H.R. 38, ""The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act"" introduced by Rep. Richard Hudson (R-NC). This legislation would allow people with state-issued concealed carry licenses or permits to conceal a handgun in any other state, as long as they abide by the laws of that state.

This legislation is hailed by major pro-Second Amendment groups and is considered ""the greatest gun rights boost since the ratification of the Second Amendment in 1791."" I have co-sponsored the ""Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act"" in past years. The legislation passed the House in 2017, but failed to receive a vote in the U.S. Senate.

I remain committed to protecting and defending the Second Amendment rights of all Americans. This bill protects the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens from being infringed upon by burdensome technicalities as they travel across state lines. I will always fight against any attempt to violate the rights of the people of Wyoming to keep and bear arms. 
Urging Congressional Leadership To Protect The Hyde Amendment: 
In the first weeks of the Biden administration, Democrats made it clear that they intend to eliminate protections for the unborn. Protecting innocent lives should not be difficult or partisan in any form.

Last Congress, Democrats blocked numerous attempts by my colleagues and I to force a vote to prevent infanticide and protect babies born-alive. It is our moral duty to stand up and fight for the most vulnerable among us. We know that if given the chance, the new administration and Democrats in Congress will ignore the importance of defending life, and take steps to allow for taxpayer-funded abortions. We cannot let that happen.

Recently, 196 of my House Republican colleagues and I sent a letter to Congressional leadership in opposition to Democrat efforts to repeal the Hyde Amendment, which has existed for more than forty years and prevents the federal government from funding abortion. The letter comes after Democrats have threatened to eliminate or weaken the Hyde Amendment and other pro-life provisions. 

The Hyde Amendment has saved millions of lives and I am proud to have joined my colleagues in standing up for the most vulnerable among us and supporting this important protection to safeguard taxpayer dollars from abortions.

The full letter can be read here and seen below: 
￼ 
Pressing Biden To Prevent Taxpayer Money From Funding Abortions In Other Countries: 
As the Biden administration and Democrats continue to advocate for their pro-abortion policies, I joined 135 of my colleagues in signing a letter to President Biden that calls on him to reconsider his decision to discontinue the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance (PLGHA) policy, also known as the Mexico City policy, which prevented taxpayer money from funding abortions in other countries when it was in place. 

The full letter can be seen here or read below:

Biden's Returning To The JCPOA Will Embolden A Terrorist Regime & Make Us Less Safe: 
This week, it was reported that the Biden Administration was rescinding efforts to enforce UN sanctions on Iran and would be formally restarting negotiations on a nuclear deal with them. 

The Administration’s actions make clear that President Biden wants to return to the JCPOA and give Iran billions in sanctions relief—even as Iran is committing nuclear blackmail and using its proxies to attack Americans.

The Iran nuclear deal was one of the most flawed agreements ever negotiated. The Obama Administration sent billions of dollars to the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism in exchange for a pathway to obtaining a nuclear weapon. Re-engaging with the human rights abusers in Tehran to revive this disastrous, outdated agreement will embolden a ballistic missile-armed, terrorist regime and make us and our allies more vulnerable to their hostile behavior.

Dear Lindsey Cormack,
Thank you to everyone who joined me yesterday for a virtual COVID-19 Vaccine town hall with two local experts: Kody Kinsley of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services ( NCDHHS) and Dr. Deepak Kumar of NC Central University (NCCU) and the  Advanced Center for COVID-19 Related Disparities (ACCORD). I wanted to highlight the important resources our panelists shared during the call:
	•	Find your vaccine group, search for local providers, and learn more about the vaccine by visiting the NCDHHS COVID-19 vaccine information hub or by calling 1-888-675-4567.
	•	Use the COVID-19 vaccine provider locator tool to find vaccine providers near you.
	•	Learn more about masking, including the most effective ways to double mask, with the CDC fact sheet.
	•	Discover volunteer opportunities, both medical and non-medical, in your community at the NC TERMS website.
	•	Explore NCCU’s research on the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on underserved communities in NC at the ACCORD Program website.
For those who couldn’t attend the event, you can access a recording of the discussion as well as my previous townhalls by visiting the COVID-19 Virtual Events page on my website.
The COVID-19 vaccine is key to ending the pandemic and starting on our path toward recovery. However, the disease is currently continuing to spread across our state. Even after you have received both COVID-19 vaccine doses, please help to slow the spread and save lives by following the 3 W’s: Wear a mask, Wash your hands, and Wait six feet apart.
Sincerely,

Addressing Mental Health Challenges among First Responders and Medical Workers
The COVID-19 pandemic has taken an enormous toll on Granite Staters’ behavioral and mental health, and this is particularly true for New Hampshire’s frontline workers – including law enforcement, fire fighters, and health care workers.  This week, I held a virtual roundtable discussion with first responders and medical workers in New Hampshire to discuss how they are handling mental health concerns among their staff. During the roundtable, participants discussed the emotional burnout and fatigue that their colleagues are experiencing amid this unprecedented crisis.    We owe all of those on the front lines of responding to this pandemic our thanks and appreciation for what they have done and continue to do to combat this deadly virus. More importantly, however, we must do more to provide them with the resources and support that they need.  The bipartisan COVID-19 relief and government funding bill, which I helped negotiate and pass into law in December, included $4.25 billion to address challenges related to mental health, substance misuse, and suicide prevention.  I am also focused on increasing investments for these services in the next COVID-19 package, including funding for mental and behavioral health training and education programs.  As this crisis evolves, we must continue working to address the mental health challenges that many frontline workers face and encourage people to reach out for help if they need it. 
If you or someone you know needs help, please call the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service National Helpline at 1-800-662-HELP (4357) to receive referrals to local treatment facilities, support groups, and community-based organizations. 
With every good wish,  ￼   Senator Maggie Hassan 
What the Senator is Working On
Senator Hassan joined her colleagues in urging the Postmaster General to restore on-time mail delivery for Granite Staters and Americans who continue to face delays in receiving their mail.

2020 Annual Report
The founders designed a legislative branch in which U.S. Senators would be accountable to the states. Each year during Utah’s legislative session, I deliver my annual report to the Utah Legislature and people of Utah, and it’s a responsibility I take seriously. While the past year has been different, my office and I made sure that we could still deliver our report this past week.  My report features the work I’ve done in both Washington, D.C. and our state to represent the values for which we Utahns are known. The pandemic of course shaped much of that work over the past year, bringing many challenges with it, but my staff and I did all that we could to creatively and safely engage with Utahns while responding to those challenges. From policy work on the Committees I sit on, to legislation I sponsored, to constituent services and events in our state, my annual report highlights my efforts to serve the people of Utah in the United States Senate. I invite you to read it below.

 Democrats Using The Pandemic To Fund Partisan Wish List
Next week, House Democrats are forcing a vote on their partisan COVID relief bill. During this process, Democrats refused to negotiate with Republicans on any amendments that would provide real relief for the American people, including the amendment that Representative McKinley offered that would support additional funding for Americans who are suffering from the opioid crisis. 

Less than 9% of the $1.9 trillion plan goes to combatting COVID-19, instead the partisan bill: 
       -Kills 1.4 million jobs by raising the national minimum wage by 107% to $15/hour
       -Provides an additional $130 billion to schools without any guarantee for in-person instruction
       -Requires taxpayers to subsidize health plans that potentially cover elective abortions
       -Illegal immigrants would be eligible for some benefits included in the package

 
Democrats' Climate Agenda is Bad for American Jobs
This week, Representative McKinley questioned the viability of clean energy proposals and highlighted how many suggestions from Democrats would put millions of hard-working Americans out of work:

“I guess the issue is can America decarbonize? Absolutely. I would agree, it can, but what’s the cost to families, communities, and businesses that are reliant on fossil fuels? This report that everyone is referring to was silent about Hazard, Kentucky, Gillette, Wyoming, Cadiz, Ohio. There are no transitional employment opportunities in those areas.”

￼

                  Listen to Representative McKinley’s Full Five Minutes of Questions

 
Bringing Broadband to Rural Communities
This week, Representative McKinley reintroduced the Facilitating the Deployment of Infrastructure with Greater Internet Transactions And Legacy Applications (Facilitating DIGITAL Applications) Act. This legislation would make it easier to develop and permit broadband infrastructure on federal property through online applications.
“Millions of rural Americans currently lack access to high-speed broadband. During unprecedented times like these, being able to access the internet is vital to the success of parents, teachers, students, and rural communities,” said Rep. McKinley. “This bill helps streamline the application process and make it easier for telecommunication companies to apply for permits so they can build out this critical infrastructure on federal land. This is a positive step in the right direction to close the digital divide in West Virginia and across the country.”

Creating Incentives for Carbon Capture Technology 
This week Representative McKinley and Representative Marc Veasey (D-TX) reintroduced the Accelerating Carbon Capture and Extending Secure Storage through 45Q (ACCESS 45Q) Act. This bipartisan legislation extends the date for projects to begin construction to claim the 45Q tax credit for carbon dioxide sequestration by ten years. It also tweaks the tax credit to make it more attractive to developers.

“As we seek to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic and regain our position as a global energy leader, we must do everything we can to encourage innovation and develop clean energy technologies like carbon capture,” said Rep. McKinley. “The 45Q tax credit is the single-most useful tool in spurring the development of carbon capture projects. This bill will lead to more projects and more widespread adoption, which is critical to reduce emissions and preserve the future of coal and natural gas.”
“This bipartisan legislation builds off our previous work to expand the 45Q tax credit and provides the certainty needed to develop carbon capture projects and use our energy resources in the cleanest way possible,” added Rep. McKinley.

Funding to Support the Opioid Crisis 
This week Representative McKinley, along with Reps. David Trone (D-MD), Guy Reschenthaler (R-PA), Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-NM) introduced the bipartisan Opioid Patients’ Right to Know Act to help prevent opioid addiction across the country.  The Opioid Patients’ Right to Know Act would create a grant program to incentivize states to require prescribers to discuss the addictive qualities of the drugs with patients and inform them of alternative treatment options before prescribing them for acute pain.  “The opioid crisis continues to take the lives of tens of thousands of Americans across the nation and the pandemic has only exacerbated this epidemic,” said Rep. McKinley. “This bill strengthens communication between patients and prescribers to ensure patients have the information they need to make educated decisions. People need to know the true risks when considering options to manage their pain and understand there are alternatives to highly addictive opioids.”

State of Preparedness
On February 16, Governor Jim Justice declared a State of Emergency for Cabell, Lincoln, Putnam, and Wayne counties due to the severe winter storm. 

Governor Justice also declared a State of Preparedness for the other 51 counties in West Virginia. 

Be careful, stay safe, and monitor the weather as there are more winter storms expected. 
 
COVID-19 Vaccine
To date, 145,734 people in West Virginia are fully vaccinated against COVID-19.

The free vaccination clinics will be held in Berkeley, Braxton, Cabell, Greenbrier, Hancock, Hardy, Harrison, Kanawha, Logan, Marshall, Mercer, Monongalia, Pocahontas, Raleigh, Randolph, and Wood counties. 

Residents from any county in West Virginia may access an appointment at any of the vaccination clinics listed, regardless of their county of residence.

West Virginians can now pre-register for a COVID-19 vaccine through the West Virginia COVID-19 Vaccine Registration System at www.vaccinate.wv.gov.

Dear friend,
This week, millions of fellow Americans endured freezing temperatures and subsequent power outages and failures. My thoughts and prayers are with the families of those who passed away and all who are facing critical challenges while seeking safety, warmth, and normalcy during this devastating weather event.
Here in San Diego, vaccination sites have had to close and reschedule appointments due to vaccine shortages, but help is on the way. Statewide numbers indicate that we're on the right path to defeat this pandemic. Please continue to wash your hands frequently, wear masks, practice social distancing and avoid large gatherings.
I continue my work in the district to stay in touch with the people I represent. Below is another update on some of the work my staff and I have done this week to serve you.

Legislative Work
Energy & Commerce Committee hearing: “A Smarter Investment: Pathways to a Clean Energy Future”
This week, the Energy Subcommittee began its work for this Congress, renewing the efforts to chart a path toward a clean energy future. During this week's hearing, I discussed modernizing our national power grid so that we can connect renewable sources with areas of high electric demand. I also asked the witnesses about the role Congress can play to remove barriers in order to build large-scale transmission projects across state lines. Click here to watch my full remarks.

District Work
Briefing with SANDAG
￼
On Wednesday, I hosted a meeting to discuss the progress of key priority projects such as the Central Mobility Hub, the LOSSAN Rail Corridor and the future of rail in San Diego. Rep. Juan Vargas (CA-51), Rep. Mike Levin (CA-49), Rep. Sara Jacobs (CA-53), Encinitas Mayor and SANDAG Chair Catherine Blakespear, San Diego Mayor and First SANDAG Vice Chair Todd Gloria, National City Mayor and Second SANDAG Vice Chair Alejandra Sotelo Solís and other SANDAG officials joined me for this virtual meeting. We look forward to increasing and improving transportation choices for San Diegans through continued collaboration and innovation.  
Meeting with Plant Diego
On Wednesday, I met with members of Plant Diego, a local group dedicated to educating and informing San Diegans about the benefits of eating a plant-based diet for nutrition, health, and environmental sustainability. We discussed policy ideas related to farm bill subsidies and environmental laws. We also spoke about the broader effects of food on climate change and my work on super pollutants and coolants.
Meeting with the Regional Task Force on the Homeless
On Thursday, I spoke at the Regional Task Force on the Homeless' board meeting and discussed my efforts in Congress to preserve and expand the VA's HUD-VA Supportive Housing (HUD-VASH) voucher program. To address veteran homelessness, HUD-VASH couples rental assistance with case management services from the VA. My bill, the Veteran HOUSE Act, was passed in the 2021 National Defense Authorization Act, and expands eligibility for HUD-VASH to veterans with other than honorable (OTH), but not dishonorable, discharges. Veterans with OTH discharges represent 3% of the veteran population, but they compose 15% of the homeless veteran population. I appreciated the opportunity to speak with the board and thank them for their critical work to support those experiencing homelessness.

NEW: Participate in our weekly poll!
We've recently introduced a new section in our e-newsletter for readers to weigh in on a relevant topic. Thank you to everyone who has participated so far. Here's this week's question:
Modernizing our national power grid can reduce the frequency and duration of power outages, reduce storm impacts, and restore service faster when outages occur. Building an interstate Macro Grid to connect remote renewable resources (sun, wind, geothermal, hydropower) with centers of high electric demand is a viable option according to research from the Dept. of Energy. Optimizing this grid may reduce carbon emissions, improve system resiliency and reduce wholesale power costs, but would require the federal government to override state and local objections to power line permitting and construction.
Would you support this kind of overhaul to our power grid?
Click here to submit your answer via Google Forms. We'll share the results in next week's e-newsletter.
Last week's question was: ""Proposals to address student debt and the high cost of higher education are being debated as we deal with the current economic crisis. What do you think?""  Here are the results:
397 Responses: 46.6% Other 31.2% We should address the student debt crisis by making college more affordable: lowering student loan interest rates and tuition and making community college free. 22.2% The federal government should forgive all existing student loan debt.

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or need assistance with a federal agency, reach out to us through our website or by calling the district office at 858-455-5550.

This week, Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation leaders announced the new Commerce subcommittee structure and leadership for the 117th Congress, including Senator Rick Scott’s new role as Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Tourism, Trade, and Export Promotion.   Senator Rick Scott said, “I’m proud to continue serving on the Senate Committee for Commerce, Science and Transportation, and as Ranking Member on the new Subcommittee on Tourism, Trade, and Export Promotion. Tourism is essential to the success of Florida’s economy and supports millions of jobs in communities of every size across our state. While I was Governor, we proudly welcomed hundreds of millions of visitors every year, shattering tourism records. Each of these visitors supported small businesses, fueled job growth and helped us increase our state and local investments in the environment, transportation, public safety and education.   “Today, as our state and nation work to recover from the coronavirus and get our economy back on track, I remain committed to doing everything I can to support our tourism industry in Florida and across the United States. I also look forward to continuing my work on the committee to improve our nation’s infrastructure, maintain the United States’ role as a leader in commerce and space exploration, and protect our national security, citizens and networks from the threat of Communist China.” Read more from the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott: It’s Time to Get Back to Work  
Following the acquittal of former President Donald Trump on Saturday, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement.   Senator Rick Scott said, “The attack on the Capitol we all witnessed on January 6 was horrific and the lawless thugs who are responsible for the disgusting violence we saw do not represent America. They should all be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. However, this week, instead of addressing the serious issues facing our nation, Democrats in Congress put our work for the American people on hold and pushed forward with an unconstitutional impeachment trial. The Democrats’ political theater was better suited for the Kennedy Center than the U.S. Capitol. It was a waste of everyone’s time and tax dollars.    ""It’s time to get back to work. I am more focused than ever on battling the coronavirus pandemic, addressing our nation’s unsustainable $27 trillion debt, holding our adversaries and the brutal dictators that lead them accountable and finding real solutions that protect DACA and tackle America’s border security problem. I’ll continue fighting to make Washington work and get things done for Florida families."" Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott: Charges Against Hong Kong Pro-Democracy Activists Must Be Dropped  
Following the start of a sham trial against Jimmy Lai and 8 pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong, Senator Rick Scott released the below statement calling on Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam to drop all charges and respect the civil liberties of Hong Kongers.   In December, Senator Scott wrote a letter to Chief Executive Lam calling on her to release Jimmy Lai and other pro-democracy activists arrested under the “National Security Law.” In September 2019, Senator Scott was the first U.S. Senator to travel to Hong Kong after the protests began to meet with Jimmy Lai and other pro-democracy activists.    Senator Rick Scott said, “This trial is a sham and is only meant to silence opposition and stop the progress of democracy. These brave activists have not committed actual crimes. They have only dared to stand for freedom, offending the fragile sensibilities of General Secretary Xi. Chief Executive Lam should stop serving as Beijing’s puppet and actually stand up for her people. Prosecuting freedom-loving citizens like Jimmy Lai is a dangerous move that threatens the freedoms of all Hong Kongers. This trial cannot go forward and all charges must be dropped immediately."" Read more HERE.

Senator Rick Scott applauded the Senate’s unanimous passage of his resolution with Senator Marco Rubio congratulating the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and the team’s loyal fans, on winning the National Football League’s 55th Super Bowl hosted this year in Tampa, Florida.    Senator Rick Scott said, “Following an amazing regular season with plenty of hard work, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers’ historic hometown Super Bowl win gave Floridians a much-needed reason to celebrate.

Sen. Rick Scott: American Taxpayers Need Transparency on Green Climate Fund Spending 
Senator Rick Scott wrote a letter to Dr. Yannick Glemarec, Executive Director of the Green Climate Fund (GCF), requesting answers and transparency on how the GCF spends American taxpayer dollars. The GCF is an element of the Paris Climate Agreement. This letter follows President Biden’s recent Executive Order on the United States’ intent to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement. Senator Scott is committed to addressing the impacts of climate change and protecting the environment while ensuring that every American tax dollar spent provides a measurable and acceptable return on investment and serves the interests of the United States.

Sen. Rick Scott Reintroduces Taiwan Invasion Prevention Act to Support our Ally Against Communist China’s Aggression 
Senator Rick Scott reintroduced the Taiwan Invasion Prevention Act, sponsored by Congressman Guy Reschenthaler in the U.S. House of Representatives, to protect Taiwan from Communist China’s growing aggression. The Taiwan Invasion Prevention Act further reinforces the U.S.-Taiwan relationship and strengthens Taiwan’s ability to resist Communist China’s aggressive policies and military actions.   Senator Rick Scott said, “It is no secret that General Secretary Xi is bent on world domination. The United States cannot sit back and let this happen, and that starts with supporting our peaceful and democratic ally Taiwan. The Taiwan Invasion Prevention Act discourages Communist China from using military force against a peaceful democratic power and strongly demonstrates our commitment to Taiwan and to the importance of freedom and democracy. The Biden Administration’s appeasement policy toward Communist China is dangerous. If President Biden fails to stand up to General Secretary Xi, it will have absolutely devastating consequences for the national security of the U.S. and our allies. I urge my Democratic colleagues and the Biden Administration to take a stand for democracy and join Representative Reschenthaler and me in holding Communist China accountable and protecting Taiwan."" Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott: Communist China Must be Held Accountable for Horrific Genocide 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following new reports revealing the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is guilty of systematic sexual assault against Uyghur women.  Senator Rick Scott said, “The CCP, under the direction of General Secretary Xi, is systematically persecuting Uyghurs. The alleged crimes committed in concentration camps in Xinjiang, especially against women, are unspeakable. Absolutely no woman, child or human should have to live under those conditions. It’s an abomination and a genocide.   “Americans can no longer stay silent about what is happening in Communist China. We must stand up for human rights and say enough is enough. We need to stop buying products made with slave labor and stop buying from Communist China, period. We need to move the 2022 Olympic Games out of Beijing. We need to remove Communist China from the UN Human Rights Council. We need to stop sending any taxpayer money to Communist China or any companies backed by their government or military. At today’s G7 meeting, President Biden must make it clear that the United States will not tolerate these atrocities. All freedom-loving nations must join together to hold Communist China accountable and condemn the CCP for its horrific genocide. These crimes must end now."" Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott Outlines Priorities in Letter to DHS Secretary Mayorkas 
Senator Rick Scott sent a letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas outlining his priorities for DHS to enhance national security and advance American interests.   Senator Scott remains gravely concerned by President Biden’s plan of open borders and amnesty, which has already led to a notable increase of apprehensions and illegal crossings at the Southern border. In his letter, Senator Scott urges Secretary Mayorkas to focus on securing the Southern border, ensuring legal immigration, finding a long-term solution for individuals in America on Temporary Protected Status (TPS), and stemming the influx of illegal immigration.

Sen. Rick Scott in the Tampa Bay Times: America Can’t Keep Spending Without Consequence, We Must Address Our Debt Crisis Now 
Senator Rick Scott wrote an op-ed for the Tampa Bay Times on how the Biden Administration and Congress must take significant, immediate action to address our nation’s federal debt crisis, which currently sits at a massive and unsustainable $27 trillion. Since becoming Senator, Senator Scott has been calling for the federal government to address this crisis and rein in the out-of-control spending that is putting our country’s future at risk.  In the op-ed, Senator Rick Scott wrote, “Since being elected to represent Florida in the United States Senate, I’ve fought hard to call out wasteful spending and offer solutions to make our government more efficient and accountable to the taxpayers. This should be the foundation of our work and service to our constituents. We can’t forget that every dollar the federal government spends is borrowed from the American people.   Sadly, over the past two years that I’ve been in Washington, I’ve realized that while many politicians make promises to uphold these values, very few put their words into practice. It’s no wonder then that our national debt continues to grow out of control. In 2020 alone the federal government increased its debt by more than $4 trillion. Today, it sits at a massive and unsustainable $27 trillion.   … Congress’ decades of failure to think and act responsibly has led to enormous deficits, insurmountable debt, and out-of-control spending. Right now, our country is spending out of control. And even before the pandemic, when the economy was booming, the federal government was running trillion-dollar annual deficits.   … This summer, Congress and President Joe Biden will face the critical choice of raising or suspending the debt ceiling. Congress has made a habit of maxing out America’s credit card with no plan to pay off our debts. Failure to reign in deficit spending will inevitably cause high inflation, devastating the purchasing power of all Americans and disproportionately impacting low and fixed income families.   Since the Biden administration doesn’t have a plan to address this crisis, I hope they’ll join me in fighting for fiscal restraint, the adoption of sustainable and responsible debt reduction measures and passage of reforms that produce concrete, enforceable limitations of deficit spending.   Americans understand they can’t spend without consequence. It’s time for government to embrace this same mentality.""   Read the full op-ed in the Tampa Bay Times HERE.

Senador Rick Scott en Diario Las Américas: Es hora de afrontar la crisis de la deuda nacional 
El Senador Rick Scott escribió un artículo de opinión esta semana para el Diario Las Américas sobre como el Congreso y la Administración Biden deben actuar para resolver la crisis de la deuda nacional la cual actualmente asciende a 27 billones de dólares. Desde que se convirtió en Senador, el Senador Scott le ha solicitado al gobierno federal que aborde esta crisis y controle el gasto descontrolado que está poniendo en riesgo el futuro de nuestro país.   En el artículo de opinión el Senador Rick Scott escribió, “Lamentablemente, durante los últimos dos años que he estado en Washington, me he dado cuenta de que, si bien muchos políticos prometen defender estos valores, muy pocos ponen sus palabras en práctica. No es sorprendente entonces que nuestra deuda nacional continúe creciendo sin control. Solo en el 2020, el gobierno federal aumentó su deuda en más de $4 billones (“trillions” en inglés). Hoy asciende a 27 billones de dólares. Esta cifra es masiva e insostenible.   … Las décadas de fracaso del Congreso de pensar y actuar responsablemente han llevado a enormes déficits, una deuda insuperable y un gasto descontrolado. En este momento, nuestro país está gastando fuera de control. Incluso antes de la pandemia, cuando la economía estaba en auge, el gobierno federal tenía déficits anuales de billones de dólares. Esto tiene que terminar.   … Este verano, el Congreso y el presidente Biden enfrentarán la decisión crítica de aumentar o suspender el techo de la deuda. El Congreso se ha acostumbrado a maximizar la tarjeta de crédito de los Estados Unidos sin ningún plan para pagar nuestras deudas. No controlar el gasto deficitario inevitablemente provocará una alta inflación, devastando el poder adquisitivo de todos los americanos y afectando de manera desproporcionada a las familias de ingresos bajos y fijos.   Las familias americanas entienden que no pueden gastar sin consecuencias. Es hora de que el gobierno adopte esta misma mentalidad”.   Puede leer el artículo completo en el Diario Las Américas AQUÍ.

Governor Inslee Must Do Better
 

Thanks to the tireless efforts of local leaders, Central Washington joined the rest of the state in moving into Phase 2 of Governor Inslee's reopening plan this week after a minor reporting effort nearly kept half of our district shuttered for another two weeks. 
 
We should all should be proud of our county commissioners, local health districts, and state legislators for their work to ensure we secured this small step to move forward, but we cannot overlook the inadequacy of the Governor’s plan. His flawed metrics and lack of a clear plan for moving past Phase 2 do not provide the clear, unambiguous information our communities and businesses need during these difficult times, especially if a small miscalculation can so severely affect the lives of thousands of us in Central Washington. What is Phase 3? Phase 4? The people of our state deserve answers. 
 
As demonstrated by this situation, it is the local health officials and elected leaders on the ground who are best equipped to manage the ongoing response to the pandemic – not the Governor. 
 
I will continue to support the efforts of our local health districts, chambers of commerce, county commissioners, and community leaders who are doing everything in their power to ensure our neighbors’ lives and livelihoods are not further harmed – by the pandemic or by the Governor’s misguided, unscientific, and out-of-touch response.

Amnesty Is Not An Option
 

This week, President Biden and House Democrats released an immigration bill, and it's a complete non-starter. It is far too massive and, frankly, too dangerous – I cannot support it. President Biden has clearly bent to the far-left leanings of his party, and this legislation will only make our nation less secure. Instead of working with Republicans to secure a bipartisan agreement that improves our immigration laws and makes our country stronger, the President and House Democrats are opening our borders, incentivizing illegal immigration by embracing blanket amnesty for all, and threatening the sanctity of the American Dream. 

We can all agree that our immigration system needs reform. I have been a leader in advocating for a stronger agriculture labor program, including introducing the first bipartisan reform legislation to pass the House in over 30 years, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act. I have also worked with my colleagues across the aisle to provide legal certainty for DACA recipients who were brought to our country at no fault of their own. It is truly unfortunate that we cannot work together to deliver on these priorities for Americans. 


Advocating for Western Water Infrastructure
 

This week, I joined Family Farm Alliance’s annual conference to discuss some of the challenges facing agriculture producers and communities in the West from crumbling water infrastructure to the threat of the return of WOTUS, the Obama Administration’s overburdensome federal mandate that unfairly impacted many of the farmers, ranchers, and landowners in Central Washington. 
 
Congress recently made progress to modernize and update the water infrastructure our region relies on, including the inclusion of my bill in the end-of-year spending package last December. However, we all agree that there is much more to be done. Infrastructure improvements – from roads, bridges, and highways to water infrastructure like dams and irrigation canals – are desperately needed throughout our communities, and we all agree there is more work to be done. I am committed to working with my colleagues to ensure we continue to strengthen water infrastructure in the West and across the country. 


Remembering and Honoring MMIW 
 

On Wednesday, members of our community gathered in Toppenish to remember and honor missing and murdered indigenous women from Central Washington and across the country. 

While we’ve made progress in our efforts to #EndMMIW, such as passing legislation I introduced like Savanna's Act and the Not Invisible Act, this vigil is a reminder that there is still much work to be done. I join our Native neighbors in mourning the loss of mothers, daughters, wives, and loved ones, and I will continue working to deliver justice for these women and their families. 

ICYMI: Hydropower is key to renewable energy plan 
 

As the United States explores ways to promote and expand clean and renewable energy, hydropower cannot and should not be left out of the equation. I remain steadfast in my commitment to support our dams along the Columbia and Snake Rivers and to strengthen hydropower infrastructure across the United States.

2,556 doses of COVID-19 vaccine were administered in the Marianas this week, bringing the total to 15,527. That’s 363 shots on Rota, 401 on Tinian, and 14,763 on Saipan. Presently, our Man Amko’ (age 65+), homebound healthcare patients, and Individuals working in high risk healthcare and first responder settings are eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine on all islands. In Saipan, individuals who are 55-years-old and workers critical to the Marianas infrastructure across the public and private sector are also eligible. Please visit VaccinateCNMI.com to determine when you are eligible and for the most up-to-date information on the COVID-19 vaccination effort in the Marianas. 
 

Vaccine for Kagman Health Center

Kagman Community Health Center is one of 250 Federally Qualified Health Centers nationwide selected to participate in the Ensuring Equity in COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution program, the Health Resources and Services Administration announced on Tuesday. After verifying participation and capability, Kagman Community Health Center will be able to receive and administer COVID-19 vaccines. These will be in addition to the doses already being sent to the Marianas each month. That means more of us will be vaccinated more quickly. The doses provided will be separate from vaccines already being allocated to the Marianas each month and should mean more of us will be vaccinated more quickly. Congratulations, Kagman Health Center! 
 
 

USDA: $62m expected for NAP. The Marianas Nutrition Assistance Program should have $62,222,036 available going forward, according to data provided by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (above). I met with the new Deputy Under Secretary for Food, Nutrition and Consumer Services, Stacy Dean, on Thursday to get a commitment from the Biden administration that we would work on including the Marianas in SNAP, the national food aid program, during this Congress; and she shared this accounting of the funds available to complete the transition. Ms. Dean and I both worked on the 2014 Farm Bill, which provided $30.5 million for the Marianas SNAP pilot program and resulted in more households being eligible and higher benefits, including differentials for Rota and Tinian to account for higher food costs there. 
 

$10.3m for NMTI training facility

The new Biden administration continued to clear the backlog of Marianas disaster recovery aid applications with a $10.3 million award to the Northern Marianas Technical Institute on Thursday. NMTI applied for the money to build a new training facility in September 2019, just a few months after we made the money available in U.S. Public Law 116-20; but the Economic Development Administration took no action, until now. The typhoon-proofed, new building will house classrooms and offices to support the NMTI trades program, which is especially needed as we continue the multi-year task of rebuilding from Super Typhoon Yutu. 410 jobs are forecast to be created as a result of this investment in training. Together with the recently announced grants to Northern Marianas College, EDA is confirming my long-held belief that investing in education is key to our economic future and one of the best ways for us to build back better. 
 

$5.8m for Marianas airports

The Commonwealth Ports Authority will get $5,823,963 from the relief package we passed in December, the Federal Aviation Administration announced this week. The Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act provided this financial aid to U.S. airports and eligible concessionaires to prevent, prepare for, and respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The FAA is distributing the funds to airports based on the number of annual boardings. The $5,823,963 allocated to CPA is further distributed, as follows:  
	•	Francisco C Ada/Saipan International – $3,785,813
	•	Tinian International – $1,022,851
	•	Benjamin Taisacan Manglona International – $1,006,299
	•	Pagan Airstrip – $9,000

Congratulations, CPA!
 
 

Rescue Plan: $515m for NMI government

Final allocations for insular areas governments from the American Rescue Plan were released this week by the Committee on Oversight and Reform. The Commonwealth government should receive $483,000,000 to replace operational funds lost because of the pandemic and address other negative economic impacts. And the Rota, Tinian, Saipan, and Northern Islands municipalities will share $32,000,000 for a total of $515,000,000. The funds may be transferred to private nonprofit organizations, public benefit corporations involved in transportation, and special-purpose units of government. Oversight and Reform is just one of many committees, which have submitted their spending plans to the House Budget Committee for compilation this week into the American Rescue Plan. That legislation goes to the House for a vote next week. At the same time, and in coordination with the House and the White House, Senate staff have been working with their Parliamentarian to make sure the compiled text meets the specific requirements that apply to a reconciliation measure in the Senate, and can be passed by a simple majority vote there. 
 
 

Renewing old friendships. Alejandro Mayorkas was sworn in as Secretary of Homeland Security earlier this month by Vice President Kamala Harris; and he reached out to renew the relationship he and I built when he led the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during the Obama administration. In our conversation on Wednesday I reminded him of his phone calls to me on two separate Thanksgiving Days to let me know he was extending humanitarian parole to people in the Marianas caught in the immigration transition. I look forward to working with the new Secretary on the Biden administration’s U.S. Citizenship Act. 
 
 

Marianas in U.S. Citizenship Act

Rep. Linda Sanchez and Sen. Robert Menendez introduced yesterday President Biden’s vision for modernizing immigration, the U.S. Citizenship Act, which includes special provisions for the Marianas I helped draft with the Biden transition team last year. The Act incorporates elements of my bill, H.R. 560, that grant permanent status to certain CW workers and foreign investors in the Marianas. The Act, also, makes certain noncitizens, including many in the Marianas, eligible for a new “Law Prospective Immigrant” status. LPI status provides lawful presence and work authorization, is valid for six years, and may be extended for an additional six years. After a minimum of five years in LPI status, an individual may be eligible for U.S. lawful permanent residence. Other provisions address backlogs in the immigrant visa system by recapturing unused visas, and adjusting certain per-country limits and create an exemption from worldwide visa limits for children of certain Filipino veterans. I am an original co-sponsor of the U.S. Citizenship Act. 
 

CNMI permanent resident update

In preparation for my meeting with Secretary Mayorkas the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services provided an update on applications for the CNMI Permanent Resident status that I created in U.S. Public Law 116-24. It has been over a year and half since the law was enacted. Of the 2,898 applications submitted, eight have been denied and 29 approved. That leaves 2,861 people still waiting. USCIS is trying to reduce that backlog, including by distributing the workload to more field offices. But, the agency says, it is facing numerous challenges due to COVID-19, including the closure of the Saipan Application Service Center, where biometric data is collected, and a high rate of Requests for Evidence to demonstrate eligibility for the new permanent resident status. The agency’s current COVID flexibilities do allow an additional 60 days beyond the normal 12-week response requirement for applicants to respond to RFEs. 
 

VA extends debt collection pause

On Thursday, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced the continuing suspension of collection on all veteran benefit overpayments and medical co-payment debts incurred after April 1, 2020 as part of its ongoing effort to provide veterans relief during the COVID-19 pandemic. The extension ends September 30, 2021. Veterans will receive notification of their current debt and expansive relief options which include extending repayment plans, waivers, compromises, and temporary hardship suspensions. For information about benefit overpayments, veterans and beneficiaries can view the Frequently Asked Questions, submit an online request, or call 1-800-827-0648. Veterans with questions about health care co-payment debts should contact the Health Resource Center at 1-866-400-1238. 
 
 

Returning as Vice Chair. Democratic Members of the Natural Resources Committee held a virtual organizing meeting Wednesday to select vice chairs and subcommittee chairs for the 117th Congress. I was chosen once again to serve as Vice Chair for Insular Affairs, a position I held last Congress when it was first created. I want to thank Chair Raúl Grijalva for recognizing the importance of giving the insular areas this voice on the Committee. Many of the issues we face are shared with other areas of our nation – climate change, for instance. Often, however, these problems are accentuated by geography, culture, or our unequal political representation. As Vice Chair in the last Congress, I was able to hold a hearing on the Medicaid funding crisis the islands faced; and the crisis was averted. I hope to use this position as effectively in the 117th Congress. I will also serve on the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands which could prove pivotal in this Congress as we expect to receive official recommendation on the suitability of a Rota National Historical Park from the Secretary of the Interior. 
 
 

Congressional Award Info Sessions. I encourage young people between the ages of 13 ½ and 24 to take part in the Congressional Award program. The Congressional Award is the highest award that Congress bestows on young people. It is not a competition, but rather something every individual can earn by meeting goals in personal development, physical fitness, public service, and exploration. Your congressional office will be hosting two virtual info sessions for new and current Marianas participants. You can RSVP for the February 25 session for current participants here. To RSVP for the March 4 session for new participants, please click here.

Hearing from Home
 
Dear Friends,
I've had an exciting week in the Centennial State meeting with Coloradans of the Third Congressional District, small business owners, and local government officials, and hearing their shared stories about their pursuit of the American Dream.  I will return to Congress inspired, and will share your stories as I work to ensure the Dream continues.
 
Fighting for Tourism and Small Businesses
I heard from many small business owners who are fighting to recover from the pandemic and stay afloat amid Democrats' job-killing executive orders. I enjoyed visiting Allen and Carol Harper’s Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad and Museum, and I heard about their struggles with COVID relief, occupancy restrictions, and lost revenue caused by the pandemic. I will work against these job-killing policies in order to help the tourism small businesses in our District recover from the pandemic and get back on their feet as soon as possible.
 
￼
 
As a fellow restaurant owner, I understood Gary and Donna Broad’s difficulties as owners of the Durango Diner. Businesses like theirs are fighting against crippling COVID restrictions, foolish incentives created by the bureaucratic unemployment system, the rising minimum wage, and burdensome regulations from the Governor, and I know where they are coming from and will never waiver in my support for small businesses.
 
￼
 
Building Partnerships with and Prioritizing Local Communities
I was excited to continue building partnerships with local governments throughout the District, and I met with the Montezuma County, Archuleta County, and Dolores County Boards of Commissioners and created plans to advocate for local issues and improve our communities.
 
￼
 
I also had the opportunity to meet with students at Dove Creek High School. It is always great to meet with the next generation’s future leaders and encourage them to get involved in the civic process early.
 
￼
 
Fighting for America First Energy
Today, I participated in a roundtable discussion focused on energy production with the Grand Junction Chamber of Commerce, West Slope Colorado Oil and Gas Association, and other regional and county officials. We discussed my bill, H.R. 859, the “Protecting American Energy Jobs Act,” which nullifies Joe Biden’s job-killing anti-energy mandates that will crush our District. As demonstrated by the blackouts across Texas, we cannot solely rely on renewable energy, and we cannot afford to ban natural gas and fossil fuels.
 
￼
 
_____________________
 
Legislative Lineup
 
Even though I spent this week traveling the District and hearing from Constituents, I continued to lead on legislation that will strengthen our communities by supporting our veterans, encouraging responsible forest management, and ensuring that the government spends our tax dollars honestly and efficiently.
 
Getting to Work
This week, I had my first House Natural Resources Committee meeting and with Colorado’s 3rd District being 55% federal lands, I was eager to work on the serious land and water issues we face. Sadly, during the meeting Chairman Raúl Grijalva cast unfair partisan attacks accusing Republicans of thinking the coronavirus pandemic is a myth simply because we want Members to have the option to get back to work in the Committee room. I made it clear that I will not stand for these partisan games, and that I want the Committee to stop playing politics and start working for the American people. If these leftists don’t decide to show up and do real work, this won’t be the last time Chairman Grijalva has to apologize.
 
￼
 
Fighting for a Safe and Growing Economy
While Democrats were busy falsely accusing Republicans of being conspiracy theorists, I was busy on a Zoom call with Dr. Anthony Fauci, NIH Director Francis Collins, and CDC Director Dr. Walensky to discuss steps we can take to move beyond the pandemic, help the Third District recover from this disease, and allow small businesses to thrive again. I was elected to provide real leadership in Congress, and that is what I intend to continue doing.

Boebert Blast
 
I went on Newsmax to voice my adamant opposition to H.R. 1, the so-called “For the People Act” which is really the “For the Swamp Act.” If passed, this Democrat wish list would use tax dollars to fund campaigns, meaning Democrats not only want to force taxpayers to listen to negative ads—now they want you to pay for them.
￼
 
I spent the week listening to local officials and working to represent their views on land use legislation pending in the House of Representatives. I will work hard to support legislation that will help our District and steward our beautiful land in a way that works for our local communities.
 
￼
 
When I ran for office, I promised the people of Colorado’s Third Congressional District that I would protect their Constitutional rights, including their Second Amendment rights to keep and bear arms. I will keep my promise, and I will never stop defending the Constitution.
 
￼
 
 
Sincerely,
￼

BROADBAND 
Take a Speed Test Here. 
The sad fact is that many places in West Virginia simply do not have access to reliable broadband and the lack of access affects West Virginians every day. Back in 2015, the FCC released a coverage map that stated 99.9% of Americans had wireless coverage. I knew then what I know now: That is just plain wrong.

MANCHIN: FCC BROADBAND DATA TASK FORCE FIRST STEP IN FIXING INCORRECT COVERAGE MAPS  Charleston, WV – Today, after years of urging from U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced the establishment of a task force to fix the FCC’s incorrect broadband coverage maps that determine eligibility for federal funds that help expand broadband access.

From the Hill to the Mountains
MANCHIN OPPOSES OMB DIRECTOR NOMINEE NEERA TANDEN   Charleston, WV – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) released the following statement on his decision to oppose Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director nominee Neera Tanden.   “I have carefully reviewed Neera Tanden’s public statements and tweets that were personally directed towards my colleagues on both sides of the aisle from Senator Sanders to Senator McConnell and others. I believe her overtly partisan statements will have a toxic and detrimental impact on the important working relationship between members of Congress and the next director of the Office of Management and Budget. For this reason, I cannot support her nomination. As I have said before, we must take meaningful steps to end the political division and dysfunction that pervades our politics. At a time of grave crisis, it is more important than ever that we chart a new bipartisan course that helps address the many serious challenges facing our nation.""

A compassionate and caring pharmacist, Drew has led the Fruth vaccine program and made sure that not one dose has been wasted. After a recent ice storm, with a clinic scheduled in Point Pleasant, Drew hand-carried the vaccine from his home and caught a ride to deliver the medication. Drew, you have gone above and beyond the call of duty. On behalf of your colleagues and the families you have served, thank you for your selfless and determined efforts.

WORKING FOR YOU
MANCHIN ANNOUNCES TWO WEST VIRGINIA HEALTH CENTER SYSTEMS TO RECEIVE COVID-19 VACCINE ALLOCATION SOON, STATE RECEIVING ANOTHER WEEKLY DOSE INCREASE  Charleston, WV – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) announced that two West Virginia health center systems, Valley Health Systems and Shenandoah Valley Medical System, will soon be receiving direct COVID-19 vaccine dose shipments through the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) COVID-19 Vaccination Program. COVID-19 vaccines provided to community health centers under this program are separate from the state’s weekly allocation, and will increase the overall vaccine supply in the state. Senator Manchin also received notification that West Virginia will receive a 7,000 dose increase in the Pfizer vaccine weekly allocation, the 4th weekly allocation increase in a row for the state.  ""Today I received notification that two West Virginia health center systems will soon be receiving direct shipments of COVID-19 vaccine doses to administer to West Virginians. West Virginia continues to lead the nation in vaccination efforts and our health centers have been integral to the distribution program. The HRSA COVID-19 Vaccination Program is aimed at ensuring equitable vaccine distribution across the state and our health centers, who serve roughly 27 percent of West Virginians, are well equipped to do just that. Vaccines are essential to defeating this horrible virus and I am incredibly pleased that our health centers have been chosen to receive doses directly. I am also pleased West Virginia will be receiving another weekly vaccine allocation increase from Pfizer, increasing the state’s ability to vaccinate more West Virginians. As vaccine production continues to increase, I will continue to work with the Biden Administration to quickly procure enough doses for every West Virginian who wants to be vaccinated,"" said Senator Manchin.

IRS: 
IRS has a new Unemployment Benefits ID theft page that links from Identity Theft Central . 
Scammers took advantage of the pandemic by filing fraudulent claims for unemployment compensation using stolen personal information of individuals who had not filed claims. Anyone whose personal information was stolen and used for this purpose should be aware of the following: 
	•	Taxpayers who receive an incorrect Form 1099-G for unemployment benefits they did not receive should contact the issuing state agency to request a revised Form 1099-G showing they did not receive these benefits.
	•	Taxpayers who are unable to obtain a timely, corrected form from states should still file an accurate tax return, reporting only the income they received.
	•	Taxpayers do not need to file a Form 14039, Identity Theft Affidavit, with the IRS regarding an incorrect Form 1099-G. The identity theft affidavit should be filed only if the taxpayer’s e-filed return is rejected because a return using the same Social Security number has already been filed.
	•	The IRS previously issued guidance requested by states, see Identity theft guidance regarding unemployment compensation reporting. No Forms 1099-G should be issued to those individuals the states have identified as ID theft victims.

For Immediate Release

Congressman Gosar Responds to the Biden Administration's Decision to Rejoin the Paris Climate Accord
 
 
WASHINGTON D.C. - In response to the Biden Administration’s announcement it plans to officially rejoin the Paris Agreement, Rep. Paul Gosar (AZ-04) released the following statement:
 
“First it was California, now it’s Texas. At a time when Americans have suffered energy blackouts during extreme cold and heat, Biden’s decision to go back into the Paris Agreement is a step in the wrong direction…unless you want more blackouts. The Paris Agreement, which is unenforceable in the United States until it is ratified as a treaty, will continue the failed Obama policies that made this country less energy independent. If you enjoy paying more for less, you will like this agreement. 
 
Under President Trump, the United States lead the world in energy production and carbon reduction, making substantial strides in both areas while simultaneously reducing our dependence on foreign sources of energy.   
 
It is alarming that Mr. Biden thinks once again we should cede our sovereign authority under this agreement, never considered or ratified by Congress, and driven by radicalized ENGOs and nations like China and Russia who have no real goals beyond using these foreign agreements to strengthen their dictatorships.”

Dear Lindsey,

This week in Orange County I toured the COVID-19 vaccine site at Soka University, and two schools that have opened safely for in-person instruction. I also had the chance to meet with a number of local groups, who shared their priorities with me and my staff. Next week I will be back in Washington, DC and it’s shaping up to be another busy week.

Today, Friday, February 19th, also marks the anniversary of Executive Order 9066, which forced thousands of Japanese Americans into internment camps during WWII. As hate crimes against the Asian American community have been on the rise, this day serves as an important reminder of the very real and negative impact that hate and racism has had on our community. 

I’ll be using this newsletter as a way to keep you up to date on my work on behalf of our Orange County community, so make sure you sign up for regular updates. You can also connect with my official Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages, where I’ll be posting the latest news and updates. 

Serving California's 48th District


COVID-19 Vaccines in OC 
This week I toured the Super Point of Dispensing (POD) site at Soka University to get a firsthand look at the vaccine efforts in Orange County. I am so grateful for the volunteers for their time and dedication to our community. The goal is to have five POD sites across Orange County to best serve residents throughout the various phases of vaccination administration. Click here for updates.
 

Did you know that 35% of the vaccines distributed to California remain unused? Increasing vaccine availability is key to returning to our normal way of life, which is why I joined my colleagues in a letter to Gavin Newsom requesting answers and transparency on vaccine distribution efforts in California. Read the letter here.


Getting Kids Back in the Classroom 
This week I toured two schools that have reopened safely for in-person instruction. I spent time at Gisler Elementary School in Fountain Valley, and The Hebrew Academy in Huntington Beach. Both schools have implemented measures to ensure students, parents, and teachers are safe. I am so grateful to educators and parents who are working hard to provide a safe environment for Orange County’s students and get our kids back in the classroom. Read more.
 

Addressing Unemployment Fraud Concerns
Two weeks ago, I sent a letter to Governor Newsom requesting answers on the widespread unemployment fraud in California. Unfortunately, I have yet to receive an answer on how his administration plans to address the concerns many Californians have about being taxed for benefits they did not receive or those who have suddenly had their benefits suspended due to suspected fraud. I want to hear directly from you about this issue.

Expanding Opportunity Zones 
Opportunity zones were created in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and are an economic development tool used to drive private investment in economically-distressed communities. This week I cosponsored bipartisan legislation that would extend the program date – currently set to expire in 2026 – by two years to give investors additional time to support projects and to encourage higher levels of investment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Honoring Capitol Police 
Our Capitol Police officers protect members, staff, and visitors every day. They were also the first on the frontlines during the violent insurrection on our Capitol on January 6th. These brave men and women deserve our respect and support, which is why I was proud to cosponsor a bill that would award our Capitol Police a Congressional Gold Medal. Read more.

2/19/21 19:12,On the Record with Congresswoman Hinson: Visiting all 20 Counties in IA-01,"
 

IA-01 Update From Congresswoman Hinson

Friend, 

I spent this week traveling through Iowa's First District to meet with constituents, groups, businesses, local leaders to hear about how they serve Iowans and how I can best serve them in Congress! We had tours and meetings in Northwood, Osage, Lime Springs, Decorah, Waukon, Elkader, Fayette, Manchester, and Cedar Rapids. It was great to tour shop floors, meet with students, hear from those who serve our veterans, and discuss the state of our agriculture industry with farmers. After wrapping up this week, I have been to all 20 counties in Iowa's First District since taking office! It is a top priority for me to hear from Iowans across the district and receive real world feedback to bring back to Washington. I am ready to get straight to work on priorities for our community. 

I also had the opportunity to participate in a bipartisan briefing with federal health officials to learn more about new variants of COVID-19 and discuss vaccination efforts. The COVID-19 vaccine is proving to be effective against the new variants of this virus, and ensuring we are getting more doses to Iowans is my top priority. I met with Hy-Vee leaders today to discuss their efforts to administer the vaccine to more Iowans. While challenges remain, I will continue to work with the Administration, the Governor, and the private sector to ensure Iowans are not left behind. 

On Wednesday, I held my first telephone town hall! I appreciate everyone who took time out of their busy schedules to join the conversation on topics ranging from tackling our mounting debt, tax policy, and of course an update on the COVID-19 relief bill and vaccination efforts in Iowa. It is important for me to be accessible and transparent and ensure my constituents know where I stand on issues that matter to them. Even though I can't promise we will agree on every issue, I can promise you'll always know where I stand. My top takeaway from the discussion reaffirmed what I've been hearing from folks across the district—Iowans need targeted COVID-19 relief as soon as possible. I look forward to hosting another telephone town hall soon, stay tuned for details!


Best,

Facebook Live Conversations

I host a variety of live conversations on my Facebook page to to help increase transparency in our government and to keep Iowans informed about issues that impact them. I will continue to dive into topics that matter to you--make sure you follow me on Facebook so you don't miss out!
 

 

Over the past few weeks, Washington's broken federal budgeting process has taken center stage. I've received many questions from Iowans about how this process works and how we can improve it for the benefit of taxpayers. I hosted Doug Holtz-Eakin, President of American Action Forum and former CBO director, for a conversation on my Facebook page to help answer some of your FAQs on the budget. Watch the conversation here. 
 
 
 

I've talked to many Iowans about policies to help jumpstart our economy and keep it growing amid the COVID-19 pandemic. I joined Americans for Prosperity for a Facebook live conversation on the pro-growth policies we need to have in place to help create jobs and boost our economy. This includes getting government out of the way and cutting bureaucratic red tape, as well as pushing back against a federally mandated minimum wage. Watch the conversation here.

SENATE INSIDER  
LISTENING TO COMMUNITY LEADERS 
During my Gibson County Schools Roundtable, I invited a group of superintendents to discuss the  importance of reopening schools. In-person learning environments might look different after COVID, but Tennessee parents, students, and teachers have adapted well. Following recent CDC guidance it is essential that we get children back in class. 
￼ 
 
HOSTING A TELE-TOWN HALL 
Tennesseans enjoyed popping on a live Tele-Town Hall with us, and this week’s call was informative. Thousands of callers joined us for a full hour of questions and answers with a great discussion of the issues impacting our communities. 
  
CALLING FOR PROPER CARE 
Our nation’s veterans have made tremendous sacrifices for our country, and in addition to our gratitude, veterans also deserve proper treatment. That’s why I called on the VA Secretary Denis McDonough to provide greater care for veterans exposed to toxic substances during their service. The VA, Department of Defense, and CDC can and should work together to care for the brave men and women who served. 
  
PROTECTING AMERICAN PATIENTS 
This week, I introduced legislation to ensure a more transparent process for prescription drug prices with the goal of lowering consumer costs and saving taxpayer dollars. This is an important piece of legislation that could relieve burdens on both patients and local pharmacies, and you can read more about it here. 
  
SAFEGUARDING CONSUMER PRIVACY 
Safeguarding consumer privacy in the technology arena is paramount. I will use my new role as Ranking Member on the Commerce Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, and Data Security to continue to hold big tech accountable as we reform online privacy regulations and protect consumers.

Dear Neighbors,
This week, I held two hearings in my Energy and Commerce Committee – one on Internet connectivity and another on pathways to a clean energy future. 
Across the country, children are unable to attend virtual classes because they do not have a reliable internet connection. In New Jersey, studies have found that nearly 17 percent of residents have no internet access in their homes. Of the families making $35,000 per year or less, only half have home internet connections. For many school kids, the dining room table or a bedroom workspace have replaced their classrooms, so a lack of connectivity means that, in essence, they are locked out of school. Congress must step in and provide support. As part of President Biden’s plan, my Energy and Commerce Committee approved $7.6 billion in funding to expand assistance for remote learning in schools and libraries. Read more here 
This week’s severe winter weather is taking a devastating toll on our nation. Millions are facing power outages in dangerously cold conditions. These outages are further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Power outages during a public health crisis underscore the importance of prioritizing clean and resilient energy infrastructure, which is exactly what I aim to do in my CLEAN Future Act. These major outages also show that the climate crisis doesn’t differentiate between red states and blue states: the whole nation is being impacted by the climate crisis. It’s time to recognize that and join together to enact the best comprehensive solutions for keeping Americans safe with affordable, reliable, and clean energy. Read more here
New strains of COVID-19 threaten the progress we’ve made in fighting this pandemic. This week, the Biden Administration pledged nearly $200 million to better identify new coronavirus threats. This is an important down payment to improve our ability to trace new strains of the coronavirus. My Energy and Commerce Committee advanced $1.75 billion in funding that was allocated for efforts to identify and survey new variants as part of the American Rescue Plan.
I also hosted a virtual roundtable for veterans in New Jersey this week. It’s important to hear from our veterans and their advocates in our community directly. I provided an update on the American Rescue Plan and how it will provide the funding we need to ensure our veterans have the care they deserve during the COVID-19 pandemic. Read more here

Mission: To Help People

We Deserve Full Transparency 
  
With the impeachment trial over for former President Donald Trump, I'd like the chance to share with you my thoughts after hearing all the testimony.
First, let me make one thing clear: I do not condone any of the violence and chaos that occurred on Jan. 6. Peaceful protesting is constitutionally protected, but some of the people at the Capitol that day crossed the line and must be held accountable for their actions.
Now, to the trial: There was no due process. I found it galling that President Trump's defense did not have the same access to information and evidence that the House managers prosecuting him did. Even senators are still in the dark about some of the details of that day. On Jan. 21, I wrote letters to the former and current Sergeants at Arms of the House of Representatives and the Senate requesting information about security on Jan. 6. I am still waiting for a response. The public deserves full transparency, but we are not getting it. Why?
Some of the videos shown during the trial were surprising and reprehensible. But we must be honest and accurate about what happened. Attacking people like me who are simply asking legitimate questions does not serve our country or the truth. I encourage you to read this article by independent journalist Glenn Greenwald, "" The False and Exaggerated Claims Still Being Spread About the Capitol Riot."" When I asked this question during the impeachment trial, neither side had an answer:
If the breach was foreseeable, why did the House Sergeant at Arms reportedly turn down a request to activate the National Guard, stating that he was not comfortable with the ""optics""? 
  
Finally, I encourage you to watch the closing argument by Trump attorney Michael van der Veen. He summed up what millions of Americans have been thinking for four years: It is hypocrites on the left who have been inciting violence and failing to denounce it.
In the end, I would argue this wasn't even a trial. It was political theater. Thankfully, the Democrats' vindictive and divisive political impeachment is over. While there are still many questions that remain unanswered, I do know neither the Capitol breach nor this trial should have ever occurred. Hopefully, true healing can now begin. 
Wrong Pick for Capitol Investigation 
  
This week, we learned that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi named retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel Honore to head the security review of the U.S. Captiol. While I agree an investigation is needed, Honore is an extreme partisan and should be the last person to head up this investigation.
For example, as outlined in this Washington Times article, Honore said the U.S. Capitol police were ""complicit"" in the Jan. 6 breach. 
Joseph Project Class 101 
 
Congratulations to the Milwaukee graduates of our 101st Joseph Project class. After a week of classes on interviewing, time and stress management, financial planning, and spiritual fitness, these graduates are then connected with employers who are ready to hire. Our next Joseph Project class will be held in Sheboygan the week of Feb. 22.

Dear Lindsey,
Last week, I shared the work I am doing in Congress to ensure we pass President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan to tackle the COVID-19 health and economic crisis. The American Rescue Plan would provide direct assistance to households by $1,400 per person and nutrition assistance to families struggling to get by. This legislative package would also expand access to affordable health care and reliable childcare, extend unemployment benefits, and help our country recover. 
As a part of the American Rescue Plan, my colleagues and I are working to secure a provision to gradually raise the federal minimum wage to increase $15 per hour by 2025. Through this provision, the minimum wage would increase to $9.50 an hour this year, then to $11 next year, $12.50 in 2023, $14 in 2024, and then $15 in 2025. The current $7.25 per hour minimum wage makes it nearly impossible for a worker to afford basic necessities and support their families – especially in the midst of a devastating pandemic.  El Paso’s poverty rate is one of the highest in Texas. Gradually increasing the minimum wage will not only benefit our workers but also allow our businesses to adjust to the increase. I strongly support raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2025 and I need to hear from you on this important issue. If you haven’t taken my survey already, please take a few minutes to share your thoughts. The deadline has been extended to Sunday, February 21, 2021, at 10 pm MT.

2/19/21 21:05,Senator Bennet’s Weekly Update,"A message from Senator Michael Bennet 
￼
Hello everyone,  
This week I had a chance to hit the road and hear directly from Coloradans about their challenges and hopes for the future. There are few things I enjoy more than taking in our state’s beauty over long drives and learning from people across our state. 
Earlier this week, I drove up to Jackson County. It’s a rural, conservative county where people are deeply dissatisfied with our health care system (they aren’t alone). I can’t tell you the number of times people have told me they have barely any options for health coverage, and what options they do have cost too much and cover too little. It’s why Jackson County was at the top of my mind this week when I reintroduced Medicare-X, my plan to create an affordable public option that starts in rural communities. 
I can point to so many other examples of how my conversations across Colorado drive our policies back in Washington -- not just health care, but broadband, forest management, immigration, and climate change. It’s why I’m so grateful whenever you make time to share your thoughts with our team. 
If you want to learn more about our work this week, I’ve included some details below. 
Have a great weekend, 
￼  Michael 

ACHIEVING UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE 
On Wednesday, Senator Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and I announced that we plan to reintroduce the Medicare-X Choice Act, our bill to achieve universal health care by creating a true public option. Our plan would expand on the Affordable Care Act and Medicare to offer people an affordable, public option for low-cost health insurance. It is a disgrace that our country pays twice as much for health care for a system that produces worse outcomes and still leaves millions without coverage. We have a moral responsibility to move toward a health care system for America that covers everyone without bankrupting families and the country, and I strongly believe that Medicare-X is the best way to achieve that.
￼

PROTECTING OUR ELECTIONS FROM DARK MONEY 
Today, a wealthy individual with personal interests in the outcome of an election -- including a wealthy foreign donor -- could make a large donation to certain tax-exempt organizations that would never have to share the donor’s information with the IRS. It’s all because of an obscure policy change made in the last administration that undermines transparency in our campaign finance system and creates a needless risk of foreign interference in our elections. As troubling as this may be, the Department of Treasury can take action to reverse the policy. On Tuesday I wrote to Secretary Yellen urging her to do just that. 
￼

DISMANTLING THE SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE 
As a country we should do a much better job of keeping students in class and out of the juvenile and criminal justice systems. Once our kids become funneled in the school-to-prison pipeline, it can have lifelong consequences for their education and future opportunities. Yesterday I had a great discussion with Brother Jeff about my new proposal to help states and districts across the country replace zero-tolerance and other punitive policies with restorative practices that take a more intentional approach to school safety and student wellbeing. 
￼
(Discussion on Brother Jeff’s show) 

PROMOTING FOOD SECURITY IN PUEBLO 
Yesterday I had a chance to hear from community leaders in southeast Colorado about the remarkable progress of the Pueblo Food Project. For context, several years ago when I heard that the Safeway on Pueblo’s East Side was closing, it was inconceivable to me that an area with such a rich tradition of local farming would struggle with access to food. So I called up Walter Robb, the former CEO of Whole Foods, to help us think through these problems. Together, we convened a group of local leaders, nonprofits, and food executives to come up with a solution. The result was the Pueblo Food Project, an initiative to expand access to healthy, locally produced food in the community. Their work has become especially critical during the pandemic, when so many have people been pushed into poverty and food insecurity. I’m so grateful for their work on behalf of the community and impressed by all the progress they’ve made over the last two years. 

RECOVERING FROM WILDFIRES 
Yesterday I joined a discussion with Governor Polis, Congressman Neguse, and Senator Hickenlooper to discuss how to best support communities across Colorado as they recover from a wildfire season marked by the three largest wildfires in our state’s history. So many people have lost their homes or had their lives turned upside down by the record-breaking fires, and we pledged to do everything we can to secure the necessary federal resources to get communities back on their feet. We also discussed the importance of ending a short-sighted national approach where we spend a ton of money fighting fires but consistently underinvest in maintaining forest health and preventing fires in the first place.

Dear Friend,
You can find my latest update below!   Winter Storm Resources    As most of Kentucky has been dealing with severe winter weather this week and the problems that snow, ice, and cold temperatures bring, I would like to remind everyone that our office is here to help.   We also appreciate the sacrifices of our local governments, first responders, emergency management directors and road crews who are doing all they can for the people of Kentucky.   If you need help with federal agencies or with replacing lost or damaged documents such as Social Security cards, VA records, military medals and records, and tax paperwork, you can contact my Bowling Green office by going to http://paul.senate.gov or calling (270) 782-8303.   Dr. Paul Reintroduces the REINS Act    Recently, I reintroduced the REINS Act (S. 68), which would help put power back in the people’s hands instead of unelected bureaucrats. 
For too long, an ever-growing federal bureaucracy has piled regulations and red tape on the backs of the American people without any approval by Americans’ elected representatives. By making Congress more accountable for the most costly and intrusive federal rules, the REINS Act would give Kentuckians and citizens throughout the country a greater voice in determining whether these major rules are in America’s best interests. 
You can read the entire bill HERE.   Media Wrap-Up    Last week, I joined Ben Shapiro on The Daily Wire to discuss the sham impeachment trial. On this episode, we discuss the hypocritical connotation that political speech must now be taken in literal terms and how politicians are responsible for the actions of a radical few. 
￼
You can find the full interview HERE. 
Dr. Paul- It’s Time to End the Forever Wars Now 
Time is up to end our endless wars and return our troops back home. As I stated in the piece for Center for National Interest, “After almost twenty years, we have lost over 7,000 killed, suffered over 50,000 wounded, and spent over $5.4 trillion, in Iraq and Afghanistan alone. And that doesn’t even account for our total human and monetary costs in the greater Middle East over the same period of time."" 
I continued to explain how “after almost twenty years of war we don’t have any of this in a coherent fashion. We are still no closer to victory nor do we even really have a realistic idea of what victory looks like. We haven’t been honest about the conduct of the war. We have continuously shifted our war aims. With a new year and a new administration, we have the opportunity to answer that question. I had hoped that we would begin to see the light at the end of this tunnel. However, with such appointees like newly confirmed U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his proven track record of military intervention, we are reminded once again that the more things change the more, they stay the same."" 
You can read my entire op-ed HERE. 
My Office is Here to Help You   My staff has an incredible track record of helping Kentuckians cut through the federal bureaucracy clutter to address challenges and concerns they may have.  We stand ready to assist in areas including:  Veterans’ benefits; Social Security and Medicare benefits; Federal tax matters and the Internal Revenue Service; Immigration matters; Passports; Federal worker injury compensation; Military academy nominations; Federal student loans; and Replacing lost or damaged documents such as VA records and military medals and records.   So, if you are a Kentucky resident and need assistance with any of the above or with other issues regarding federal agencies or programs, or if you need help navigating the federal response and ongoing community needs related to COVID-19, please feel free to contact my Bowling Green office at 270-782-8303. (Kentucky has also set up a COVID-19 Hotline at 1-800-722-5725.)  Please contact us without hesitation, as my staff is happy to help!

Black History is American History
 
 
February 20, 2021
 
Dear Friends,
Throughout Black History Month, we recognize and celebrate the countless leaders and innovators who have shaped and continue to shape our nation for the better.
In last week’s newsletter, I briefly highlighted the awe-inspiring work of viral immunologist Dr. Kizzmekia Corbett, one of the leading scientists who worked to develop the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. Dr. Corbett and many other African-American doctors and public health researchers are using their scientific expertise to address Americans’ vaccine hesitancy, especially in communities of color with a history of being overlooked—or worse—by our government. 
COVID-19 has exposed and worsened many of the deepest injustices in American society and has hit communities of color—especially predominantly Black communities—hardest. This problem is made far deadlier by a chronic lack of access to health care, discrimination and medical mistrust compounded by past injustices including the horrifying Tuskegee study. And now these communities are being left behind in America’s national vaccine rollout. 
I am reminded of Dr. King’s admonition that “injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” We are surrounded by injustices, and if we are to overcome the challenge of this moment we must stop compounding the failures of our past. We must step up immediately to address these health disparities and prioritize equitable vaccine distribution to protect our loved ones, our neighbors and our communities. 
One of the keys to righting these wrongs and ending this pandemic is vaccine availability. Simply put, we are building systems to put shots in arms faster than companies are making and shipping them. I sent letters to Pfizer and Moderna this week seeking answers on why the rollout has been slower than we need and to seek guidance on how America can supercharge our vaccine production. Some of this may be out of our control, but I’m going to ensure every possible measure is taken by Congress to remove any barriers hindering rapid vaccine production and just and swift distribution. 
Just yesterday, I heard from experts during a full House Science Committee hearing on the research and science behind the COVID-19 vaccines and how we can boost vaccinations and speed up the process of achieving herd immunity.
Dr. Corbett’s pioneering work has already saved countless lives and is helping America turn the page on this dark chapter of our history, but she is far from alone. Black scientists, doctors and trailblazers have made lasting contributions across the fields of medicine and science. Their triumph in the face of adversity continues to inspire and raise the bar of civic and scientific achievement. 
I am delighted to share that many Black visionaries in science and public health have hailed from New York State, including:
	•	James McCune Smith: Born in 1813, Dr. Smith became the first African American to hold a medical degree, and the first to own and operate a pharmacy. A stalwart abolitionist, he helped Frederick Douglass start the National Council of Colored People in 1853, the first permanent national organization for Black people.  
	•	Louis T. Wright: Dr. Wright was a surgeon at Harlem Hospital, where he founded the hospital’s cancer research center. He joined the Army Medical Corps, serving as a lieutenant during World War I. During his service, he introduced the intradermal vaccination for smallpox and was awarded a Purple Heart. Continuing his groundbreaking legacy, in 1929, he was appointed to serve as the first African American police surgeon with the New York Police Department.  
	•	Jane Cooke Wright: Daughter of Louis Wright, Dr. Jane Cooke Wright worked alongside her father at the Cancer Research Foundation in Harlem. She led research in chemotherapy drugs that led to remissions in patients with leukemia and lymphoma. Her work helped transform chemotherapy to a viable treatment of cancer, and in 1971, she was elected to be the first woman president of the New York Cancer Society.  
	•	Phyllis Harrison-Ross: As a pioneering pediatrician, psychiatrist, and mental health administrator, Dr. Harrison-Ross dedicated her life to serving underserved populations, including incarcerated individuals. She led in designing rehabilitation and therapy for children, was at the forefront of developing telepsychiatry, and in 2000, she founded the Black Psychiatrists of Greater New York & Associates.
No single list could possibly do justice to the incredible scope of medical and scientific advancements of Black Americans that continue to better countless lives throughout our communities and nation. And as we celebrate the work of these heroes and visionaries, let us never forget the countless Black figures whose achievements have been omitted or erased by a history of bigotry and indifference.
Black history is American history. As we celebrate Black History Month, let us continue to draw inspiration from these leaders in science and public health, and recommit ourselves to the vital work of fulfilling that sacred promise of liberty and justice for all.

With the right precautions, the CDC has confirmed that schools can reopen safely. So it’s time to give families a choice in the education of their kids. 
Q&A: Iowa-Grown Energy is Good for America
￼
Q: Why did you invite the Biden administration’s climate advisor to Iowa? 
Q: Why are people blaming wind energy for the recent power outages in Texas? 
Quick Links
This week, I was back on the road holding Q&As with Iowans as part of my annual 99 county meetings. I enjoyed hearing what was on the minds of Iowa’s students, farmers and everyone in between. 
In a recent interview, White House Climate Czar Gina McCarthy made some disparaging comments about Middle America saying that, “we have to get the middle of the country understanding and active on climate. We have to show them what resilience looks like."" 
Well, Iowans already know a thing or two about resilience and that’s why I’ve invited her and President Biden to Iowa to see renewable energy in action. Read my full letter here. 
In light of new reports alleging New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and his staff engaged in a cover-up of the nursing home COVID-19 death toll, I joined my Judiciary Committee colleagues in a letter urging Chairman Durbin to open an investigation and schedule hearings into Cuomo’s COVID-19 cover-up.

2/20/21 8:36,"Weekly Wrap-Up: USPS delays, healthcare enrollment, tax filing","￼

Dear Lindsey,  I hope you and your family are doing well and staying safe as we've endured the icy weather here in Central Virginia this past week.
 
In this email, you'll find a brief summary of some of my week's work, as well as helpful information and resources on a variety of subjects, from health insurance enrollment to tax filing assistance. As always, thank you for the privilege to serve Virginia's Seventh District.
  
 
WHAT I'M WORKING ON
 
  
This week, I sent a letter to President Biden, urging him to swiftly fill vacant seats on the United States Postal Service Board of Governors – which has the power to dismiss the Postmaster General – so they may seriously consider U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy's fitness for the role. Over the past several months, I have received hundreds of emails and calls from Central Virginians with concerns about ongoing USPS delays. According to recent reports, DeJoy is planning to enact operational changes at USPS that would slow mail delivery and service, as well as increase costs to consumers. DeJoy has proven himself ill-suited to the challenges facing USPS. READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON POST
 
On Tuesday, I visited the Phlow Corporation lab at Virginia Commonwealth University's Medicines For All Institute to learn more about their joint work to strengthen U.S. development of critical medications, fortify our medical supply chain, and bring high-paying biopharmaceutical jobs to Central Virginia. This research is critical, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, and I am proud to see it happening right here in Virginia. 
  
￼
￼
  
 
￼
 
  
Also this week, I reintroduced bipartisan legislation to make jobs in early childhood education – including Head Start positions – eligible for Work Study funding. Currently, students pursuing education careers can't use Work Study dollars to work in Head Start centers. I'm proud to support students working in education, and I'm proud to support Head Start, which has a demonstrated record of improving outcomes for children and families across Central Virginia.
 
I was lucky enough to see this firsthand during a visit with the three and four year olds of Culpeper Head Start during my 2019 education tour across the Seventh District.

SPECIAL ENROLLMENT PERIOD
 
  
The administration has opened a special enrollment period for ACA Marketplace health insurance signups or plan changes. This special enrollment period will be open through May 15, 2021. If you do not have health insurance and are interested in signing up for coverage, or if you are insured through the marketplace and want to review the options available for you and your family or change your provider, you can do so at healthcare.gov. If you are currently uninsured, you now have a special enrollment opportunity to get the coverage you need. Coverage begins on the first day of the month after enrollment, even if you sign up on the last day of a month.
  
 
￼
 
  
This step is long overdue. I first called for a special enrollment period almost one year ago when the COVID-19 pandemic began so that Seventh District families who may be at risk of contracting the disease have access to healthcare coverage. I am glad to see that this administration has done so to bring peace of mind to Central Virginians as we still face this pandemic.

TAX TIPS: FREE FILE WORKSHOP
 
  
As we've entered tax filing season, I want to provide you with a helpful resource for filing your federal tax return on your own. The Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) Richmond office, in partnership with Legal Services of Northern Virginia and the Financial Empowerment Center, will be hosting an IRS FreeFile Virtual Workshop on Wednesday, February 24 at 3pm via Zoom. IRS-certified tax counselors will cover logging on to the IRS Free File program, selecting the best option for you, properly completing your return, and more. Also, if you have specific questions about your tax records, their staff will host secure one-on-one breakout sessions via Zoom to get you the information you need. CLICK HERE FOR DETAILS
  
 
DETAILS ON RECOVERY REBATE CREDIT
 
  
Most people eligible for stimulus checks have already received the full amount in two rounds of Economic Impact Payments. If you have already received the full amount, you do not need to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit or include any information related to it when you file your 2020 tax return. If you're eligible for Economic Impact Payments, but were not issued stimulus checks or did not receive the full amounts, you must file a 2020 tax return to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit even if you are not otherwise required to file a tax return.
 
You received the full amounts of both Economic Impact Payments if:
	•	Your first stimulus payment was $1,200 ($2,400 if married filing jointly), plus $500 for each qualifying child.
	•	Your second stimulus payment was $600 ($1,200 if married filing jointly) plus $600 for each qualifying child.
Note: some people at higher income levels are eligible for less than the full amount, so you may have received the maximum payments you are eligible for, even if you did not receive the above amounts. If you believe that you have not received the full amounts you are eligible for, please click here to learn more about how to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit. You can also read answers to frequently asked questions on the IRS website.

IN HONOR OF SENATOR JOHN GLENN
Today, February 20th, we remember NASA astronaut and Ohio Senator John Glenn for being the first American to orbit the earth. Not only did he become a national hero for his four-hour and fifty-five-minute journey to space in 1962, but he also earned many honors for both his military and public service achievements. In 1998, Glenn returned to space at the age of 77, and in 2012, President Obama awarded him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor the country can bestow. 
Senator Glenn believed that government could help people and he also put his trust in science and progress. I continue to be inspired by his legacy and will always work to leverage both our traditional and advanced manufacturing strengths, our emerging capabilities in renewable energy and battery storage, and the production of electric vehicles. As we work to revitalize our region, we are well-positioned to provide good-paying jobs for our workers, and at the same time address global energy needs and environmental concerns. As an example, LG Chem and General Motors (GM) have recently announced a joint venture to produce batteries at its Ultium plant, and Lordstown Motors will build its first Endurance truck in 2021. We will be ready to put people to work making things—something we have always been good at.

￼

I recently invited President Biden to tour the Mahoning Valley and participate in a “Voltage Valley” roundtable, which would include area leaders in government, academia, clean energy research, energy entrepreneurship, and economic and workforce development. Our goal will be to discuss strategic initiatives and look for opportunities to accelerate local efforts that align with the current administration.
Senator Glenn always believed in the good of mankind. He knew the importance of serving our nation and made sure to do everything in his power to give his and the following generations a better future. Today, we remember him in a special way in thanksgiving and gratitude for his heroic actions and his determination to help mankind to achieve higher excellence.

Best,
￼
Tim

2/20/21 9:30,Leading on Biofuels,"
 

Congressman Smith's E-news: February 20, 2021  
 

This week I met with Falls City High School to hear directly from students regarding their concerns about education, the agriculture industry, and the financial stability of small businesses.

Leading on Biofuels

Nebraska is a biofuels powerhouse - the second and third largest producer of ethanol and corn, respectively, in the country. With 25 active ethanol plants and a capacity of more than 2.5 billion gallons, the importance of biofuels to our state economy cannot be understated. Biodiesel production in Nebraska has seen exponential growth as well. Thanks to innovation and technological developments, biodiesel production has grown from 25 million gallons in 2004 to 2.9 billion gallons in 2019. Ethanol has an economic impact of $5 billion in Nebraska, and in turn the industry directly employs more than 1,400 Nebraskans. 

I am proud to be named as one of the co-chairs of the Biofuels Caucus in the House of Representatives for the 117th Congress. The Biofuels Caucus has historically been both active and impactful in promoting the availability of these energy sources. As the only Nebraskan to co-chair the caucus I am committed to ensuring our state’s voice is always part of the discussion. 

The Biofuels Caucus has already acted this year to support the essential work of the industry. Last month I joined my fellow co-chairs in leading a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency expressing our opposition to efforts to approve several small refinery exemptions (SREs). The SRE program allows refineries to be exempt from the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS) if the RFS causes economic hardship. However, these petitions in question would have run counter to the 10th Circuit Court's ruling in 2020 that exemptions can only be granted as extensions and therefore did not qualify for the SRE program. 

Now, more than ever, transparency in fuel markets is vital for our farmers and biofuels producers. For this reason, I recently cosponsored the Renewable Fuel Standard Integrity Act to ensure all parties can make production decisions knowing they can rely on the EPA to fairly and evenly enforce the RFS. This bill aims to impose an annual deadline of June 1st for small refineries to submit small refinery exemptions.  

In recent years, the demand for ethanol has reached record heights, and as we approach nearly one year of the coronavirus pandemic, we need to make sure the biofuels industry is not left behind. As the only Biofuels Caucus co-chair to also serve on the Ways and Means Committee, I have the unique opportunity to highlight biofuels issues in the policy areas of tax, business, and trade. I aim to level the playing field with current trading partners to find new opportunities by expanding our reach into foreign markets while I work to protect the Renewable Fuel Standard, generate jobs, and provide support for our rural communities. 

The Renewable Fuel Standard Integrity Act
In Congress this week, I introduced the Renewable Fuel Standard Integrity Act with my fellow co-chairs of the Congressional Biofuels Caucus. This bipartisan legislation aims to ensure transparency and predictability to the Environmental Protection Agency's small refinery exemption process. Learn more about this bill here. 

Hearing from Nebraskans 
On Tuesday and Thursday of this week I had the opportunity to meet with Nebraskans during two virtual mobile offices. I want to thank everyone who joined these sessions, I appreciated the chance to hear from the Third District directly and answer your questions.

2/20/21 9:34,For the love of baseball,"￼ 

February 20, 2021 
Dear Fellow Marylander: 
I miss baseball. 
I know that the Orioles have not been very good lately, but they are still my hometown team and I will root for them in good times and bad. 
Let me rephrase my first sentence. I miss experiencing baseball. 
As the Orioles’ pitchers and catchers reported to Ed Smith Stadium in Sarasota this week, I realized how much I miss being in the stands and feeling the rush of every pitch and the thrill of double plays. Watching baseball on television can be fun, but being there in person with friends and family brings with it an electricity that is unmatched.
For me, like many other baseball fans, 2020 was an awkward mix of long-distance cheering and wistful remembrances of “normal” times. 
At the start of 2021, Major League Baseball (MLB) announced that it will allow teams to host fans again with a 25 percent capacity limit based on local conditions and public safety regulations. As it has been described, pods of ticket holders will need to stay six feet apart from other pods. That limits the chances of having a random person accidentally knock into you with their beer or hot dog, so there is some additional benefit. 
We are in this place because of COVID-19, which has had a grip on the U.S. for a year now. Almost 28 million people in this country have tested positive and nearly 500,000 have lost their life to the virus and the disease that it triggers. More than 7,600 Marylanders are among those who have died. From coast-to-coast, tens of millions have lost their jobs and too many are on the verge of losing their homes or not knowing if they will be able to put food on the table for their family in the middle of winter. This is our current normal.
On April 1, when the Orioles take to the field against the Boston Red Sox, I would love to be at Camden Yards. In reality, I am doubtful that I will be ready for such a large crowd, even at 25 percent capacity. If you are considering it, I would recommend that you assess your own personal risk and talk to your doctor. 
To date, only about 11 percent of Americans have been vaccinated against COVID-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In Maryland, if you are a healthcare provider or nursing home staff, a first responder or law enforcement, live in an assisted living facility, K-12 teacher or education staff, in food production, mass transit or work in a grocery store, or are over age 65, you are eligible to receive a vaccine at this time. Please see here for a complete list of current eligibility. 
Demand for vaccines far exceeds supplies at this time. The process has been exceedingly frustrating for most Marylanders. Thankfully, the Biden administration has procured more doses and is steadily increasing shipments to states, including Maryland. 
I expect we will make significant progress in the next month but it is likely we will still need more time before reaching what might be considered “herd immunity” and the number of vaccinated adults outnumbers the non-vaccinated. Think of it as if the O’s have taken the lead, but it’s still only the fourth or fifth inning. Momentum is on our side but there is still lots of ball to be played – and it could go either way. 
Over the last year, I’ve urged caution as our community and our country tried to navigate this pandemic. We can’t get ahead of ourselves and declare the win prematurely. It’s that kind of overconfidence that stretched out our first wave of infections into extra innings. 
Getting as many people vaccinated as possible will be a game changer in this battle against COVID-19. But immunization alone will not end this pandemic and public health crisis. The virus is still in our communities. We must continue to wear masks around people not in our households, practice frequent hand washing and keep adequate physical distancing.
I don’t expect to see Chance Sisco take off his catcher’s gear in the eighth or ninth inning just because the Orioles are ahead. So let’s keep up good public health practices as long as necessary – for ourselves, for our family and for our community.
For the love of baseball, get vaccinated when it is your turn and wear a mask, even after you have gotten your shots. Thank you.

PRESS RELEASE
For Immediate Release
February 20, 2021



Representative Adriano Announces 2021 Congressional Art Competition for District High School Students 

Espaillat Serves as a Co-Host of the National Art Competition Open to High School Students Around the Nation


￼


WASHINGTON, D.C. – Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) released the following statement to encourage high school students throughout New York's 13th congressional district to submit entries as part of this year’s Congressional Art Competition, a national contest open to high school students from around the district to showcase their artistic talents with an opportunity to display their winning art in the United States Capitol for up to one year. 

Rep. Espaillat serves as a national co-host of this year's art competition, which is open to high school students from around the nation. The deadline to submit entries from NY-13 is Friday, April 30th. 

There is no required theme, however artwork that highlights the culture and diversity of New York's 13th congressional district is highly encouraged. The original artwork may include digital submissions of paintings, drawings, collages, and photography. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, artwork may be submitted from the 2019 school year, the 2020 virtual school year and the current 2021 hybrid year – as many communities continue to navigate the reopening process for students and families.

“New York is home to some of the world’s most celebrated artists and that artist talent starts early.

Congresista Adriano anuncia Competencia de Arte del Congreso 2021 para estudiantes de secundaria del distrito
Espaillat servirá como coanfitrión de la Competencia Nacional de Arte 2021 abierta a estudiantes de secundaria de toda la nación


WASHINGTON, D.C. – El congresista Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) emitió la siguiente declaración para alentar a los estudiantes de secundaria de todo el distrito congresual 13 de Nueva York a presentar sus trabajos a la Competencia de Arte del Congreso de este año, un concurso nacional abierto a estudiantes de secundaria de todo el distrito para mostrar sus talentos artísticos con la oportunidad de exhibir su obra ganadora en el Capitolio de los Estados Unidos hasta por un año.

PRESSING IRS ON REFUND BACKLOG
￼
This year’s tax filing season opened February 12th, but the IRS still has a backlog of more than 1.3 million pieces of unopened mail and 11 million unprocessed tax returns from last season.
I’m concerned about the impact this backlog will have on the new filing season – and the impact it’s currently having on individuals and businesses still waiting for a refund.
I’ve heard from many people in our community who are facing financial difficulties due to the coronavirus crisis but have yet to receive the tax refund they’re owed. These hardworking Hoosiers need their refunds urgently and can’t afford any more delays. They need swift action so they can continue to put food on the table and provide for their families.
I joined my fellow Republicans on the Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee this week in asking IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig for a plan to resolve the backlog and deliver refunds still owed to individuals and businesses.
I also raised the issue in a subcommittee hearing, and I’ll continue to work with the IRS to ensure taxpayers get the services they need with the speed they deserve.
Here are some steps you can take as you prepare to file this year:
	•	To get your tax refund in a timely manner, file your tax returns as soon as possible and, if possible, electronically. Check on your refund status here.
	•	Taxpayers who never received an economic impact payment, or who received an incorrect amount, can claim those payments on this year’s tax returns. Find out about the Recovery Rebate Credit here.
	•	If you want to file your taxes for free and avoid headaches, learn about Free File here.
	•	You can also save time and money with the help of some other free tax prep resources like VITA and TCE. Learn more here.
	•	The Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) is your voice at the IRS and might be able to help you with a tax problem you haven’t been able to resolve on your own. Click here or call (317) 685-7840 for the Indiana TAS.
NEW ERA OF AMERICAN MEDICAL INNOVATION
￼
Last summer, I toured the Arizona Isotopes Research Corp. facility while it was still under construction. 
I learned all about the medical isotope manufacturer’s partnership with Grissom Aeroplex and the opportunity for northern Indiana to become an innovative hub for manufacturing, staging, and warehousing PPE and other essential medical supplies.
￼
This week, I had a chance to visit again to tour the newly up and running facility and get an update on expansions that will begin soon.
The broad range of isotopes being produced at this cutting-edge facility will enable Arizona Isotopes to deliver high-level diagnostic imaging and therapeutic treatment isotopes to patients and providers and to be at the forefront of medical research.
￼
Not only is this an incredible investment in our local economy that will create 40 new high-wage jobs by the end of 2022, it is also the starting line for a new era of American medical innovation right here in Miami County.
BLACK HISTORY MONTH
￼
During Black History Month, we celebrate the invaluable contributions black Americans have made to our nation’s history and culture, and we reflect on our nation’s promise of liberty and equality for all. 
Since 1976, Americans have taken this important opportunity to learn more about historic moments, rediscover personal narratives, and engage in conversation about identity and diversity.

2/20/21 10:34,Weekly Update: Mike Madigan Resigns,"

Weekly Update | February 20, 2021
 

Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan Resigns

Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan has been the constant force in state government during Illinois’ steadying decline over the past two decades, wrecking our state finances and pushing policies that have run our state into the ground. During his half-century in office, Madigan has shepherded tax hikes, budget deficits, pension holidays, debt, and job-crushing regulations through the General Assembly, all while accumulating a massive amount of personal political power and enriching himself through his property tax appeals law firm. Because of Madigan’s failed leadership, Illinois families have been voting with their feet and leaving our state in droves.
 
Illinois will be better off without Speaker Madigan having the final say on public policy, but let’s not forget, he still serves as Chairman of the Democratic Party of Illinois and maintains much influence over politics in our state. And let’s be clear - Madigan isn’t resigning on his own terms. He is resigning in disgrace because he has been implicated in a federal corruption investigation that has already seen indictments of several of his close associates. Even as Madigan’s time in public office comes to a close, he should not avoid prosecution for crimes he may have committed in office. Federal prosecutors should continue their investigation into the years-long bribery scheme that was set up for the benefit of Speaker Madigan.
 
While Madigan may no longer be steering state government, the consequences of his agenda and poor policy choices will be felt for generations to come. We, along with the people of Illinois, welcome his retirement from public office, but now is the time to work to reform state government so that we never see another politician accumulate and wield power like Madigan did.

Highlights of Our Office's Constituent Services in 2020

Last week, our office released the following information about our constituent service work to help people struggling during the Coronavirus pandemic. The office set a record of 2,000 completed cases and achieved a 99% satisfaction rate. These numbers cover the 2020 calendar year.

I am extremely proud of the support my staff and I have been able to provide to my constituents during a year like no other. People and small businesses were hurting across America and my district was no different. Workers who had never applied for unemployment before, or never thought they'd need a check from the U.S. Treasury just to pay their bills were suddenly forced to confront the bureaucracy of government. Citizens found themselves stranded as a pandemic closed the borders of the world. Small businesses found themselves needing help from the government just to stay afloat at no fault of their own. My staff and I were there for those we are blessed to serve and will continue to be until this virus is defeated and beyond.

2,000 Completed Cases

That is triple the amount of cases completed in 2019 and double the previous high set in 2014 fueled by veterans needing help during the scandal at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The top three issues addressed were related to unemployment, taxes, and international travel. There was also a significant increase in small businesses seeking out assistance.
470 Unemployment Cases

33 or 7% of these cases were taken on pre-COVID during the first 3 months of the year which is a regular amount by normal standards. However, as government-mandated shutdowns closed businesses and Congress responded by bolstering unemployment benefits we saw an unprecedented influx in those needing financial assistance. The most common issues were complaints about the Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES) being slow to implement the expanded benefits and that once they were implemented constituents could not reach anyone at the agency if they needed help. Our office gave constituents the best available information and guidance as Governor Pritzker and his administration repeatedly failed those most impacted by the pandemic.

400 Tax Cases

17 or 4% of these cases were completed during the first 3 months of the year which is not an irregular amount for that period. The giant spike in cases (1,350% increase from 2019) for the remainder of the year was driven by two factors. First, Congress sending Economic Impact Payments (EIPs) to the vast majority of American households with an emphasis on getting out aid quickly left some wondering where their relief was. Second, COVID-19 induced Internal Revenue Services (IRS) facility closures delayed paper tax returns for the 2019 tax year. We worked case by case to resolve these situations so people got the relief they were entitled too. We also want to note that this number reflects those our office intensively assisted and opened up a formal inquiry on their behalf. Our office estimates that we answered basic questions from hundreds if not thousands of constituents related to EIPs that did not require a case being opened.

325 Travel Cases

62 or 20% of cases were conducted in March as global travel restrictions were put in place due to the COVID-19 outbreak. As constituents rushed to get back to the United States from across the world under sudden and unsettling circumstances our office closely monitored travel restrictions, provided guidance, and secured passage home for many.

60 Small Business Cases

While not one of the top areas by volume this area represents an enormous increase over regular years. Small business owners are known for their independent entrepreneurial spirit and rarely look to the government for help. As the Coronavirus and government ordered lockdowns shuttered their businesses they needed and deserved a lifeline. Congress stepped up and provided them relief that was implemented in a matter of days after passage. Our office helped 60 small businesses navigate issues with the Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLS) and Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Congressman Davis hosted a tele-town hall with over 300 small business owners and our office provided regular updates to Chambers of Commerce across the district.

99% Satisfaction Rate

Constituents who open up a case with our office receive a feedback survey after their case is closed. The feedback we receive allows us to continually improve the services we provide. For the year 2020 our satisfaction rate indicated very good or excellent service exceeded 99%. 

Constituent Service Spotlights

Our office regularly highlights ways in which the Congressman and his staff can serve constituents by sharing feedback we have received from those already helped. You can view the all of these on our Facebook and Twitter or search most recent #ConstituentServiceSpotlights. 
 


My Committee Assignments for the 117th Congress

For the 117th Congress, which runs from January, 2021 to January, 2023, I will continue to serve on the following committees in the U.S. House of Representatives: Transportation and Infrastructure (T&I), Agriculture, and House Administration. 

I have served on the T&I committee since coming to Congress in 2013 and have been a leading voice for infrastructure investment at the national level. I have worked to pass numerous surface transportation, airport, and water infrastructure bills.

I have also served on the Ag committee my entire time serving in Congress and has been a trusted voice for Illinois' rural communities and agricultural economy. During that time, I've helped negotiate the 2014 and 2018 farm bills, maintaining and strengthening critical programs for Illinois farmers.

And I will continue to serve as the Ranking Member (lead Republican) of the Committee on House Administration. I joined this committee in 2015 at the onset of the 114th Congress and was elevated to Ranking Member for the 116th Congress in 2019. This committee is charged with the oversight of federal elections and the day-to-day operations of the House. 

I requested to continue my service on these committees again this Congress because they have such a large impact on the economy and quality of life across Central and Southwestern Illinois. According to the Census Bureau over 285,000 of my constituents use roadways or transit systems to get to work and earn an income. Even more use our roadways for day-to-day and leisure travel. The Ag Census relays that 85% of the 13th District is farm land and that $1.9 billion in farm grown goods are sold annually here. These numbers clearly demonstrate that the issues these committees cover matter to my constituents. It is my honor to continue to be their voice in Washington, D.C.

Full Committee Assignment List: 
	•	House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
	•	Subcommittee on Highways and Transit (Ranking Member)
	•	Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials
	•	House Committee on Agriculture
	•	Subcommittee on Biotechnology, Horticulture, and Research
	•	Subcommittee on Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit
	•	Committee on House Administration (Ranking Member)

Your weekly update from Congress

Hello Lindsey,

This week I met virtually with small businesses and chambers of commerce from across my district as part of my Small Business Advisory Committee to talk about the changes still needed to safely reopen and rebuild California’s 8th District economy. Their message was clear: Improving the PPP program and ensuring existing relief dollars are spent quickly is the best way to help our communities recover.

On Monday, I cosponsored a resolution requiring accounting of unspent COVID-19 stimulus funds as a way to support our small businesses and families still awaiting desperately needed aid. Current estimates show roughly $1 trillion in COVID-19 stimulus funding remains unspent, which is nearly 1 in every 4 dollars allocated for COVID-19 relief since the beginning of the pandemic. We cannot allow this money to go unspent while people and businesses continue to suffer in places like the High Desert, Inland Empire, and Eastern Sierras.

Teacher of the Month
 
 
 
 
This week I surprised Lewis Center Academy teacher Amy Ritter with my Teacher of the Month award. Amy has worked hard to bring hands-on STEM education to students across our region and the globe despite the pandemic with local outreach field trips and the Goldstone Apple Velley Radio Telescope (GAVRT) Radio Astronomy Project. She is an amazing example of what hard work and dedication to students can accomplish both inside and outside of the traditional classroom.

Demanding answers on California's unemployment fraud

I’ve recently joined other members of the California congressional delegation to demand answers in response to confirmation that the California Employment Development Department (EDD) has paid out at least $11.4 billion in fraudulent unemployment claims. This level of mismanagement of taxpayer dollars is completely unacceptable and has serious implications for all American taxpayers, but particularly for Californians whose personal information was stolen by criminals seeking to capitalize on California’s broken system.

2/20/21 11:08,Randy's Roundup: Delivering relief for natural disaster victims,"
 
 
 

Dear Friend,

2020 was a tough year for many Iowans, and unfortunately, it wasn’t just because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many Iowa farmers and rural business owners suffered losses due to the derecho and severe droughts, both of which impacted millions of acres of cropland across our state. That’s why I made it a priority to deliver much-needed relief for producers impacted by the derecho and other natural disasters.
 

MY LATEST COLUMN: Delivering relief for natural disaster victims

On Monday, August 10, 2020, a massive storm system with high winds and isolated tornadoes tore through the Midwest, leaving a 700 mile path of destruction in its wake -- from Nebraska all the way to Indiana. In Iowa, early estimates indicated that 43 percent of cropland was impacted across the state, flattening millions of acres of corn and soybeans, crippling grain bins, and tearing barns and machine sheds apart. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimated damages from the storm, known as a derecho, would amount to $7.5 billion -- making it the most costly severe thunderstorm in United States history. 

When this devastating storm swept across the Midwest, many producers were already grappling with market disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As Congress began debating the latest stimulus bill, I kept this in mind and made it a priority to deliver much-needed relief for farmers and rural businesses impacted by the derecho and other natural disasters.

I am extremely pleased that an amendment I proposed, which would grant assistance to those affected by high wind storms like last summer’s derecho, was adopted by the House Agriculture Committee. By reallocating some of the funds appropriated in the original bill to be used for the United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Wildlife and Hurricane Indemnity Program (WHIP), this legislation will help thousands of producers across the country who have suffered losses from natural disasters or severe weather -- including floods, snowstorms, and droughts.

MEETING WITH IOWANS

In order to deliver results, I know how important it is to listen directly to Iowans’ concerns so I can take them to Washington. Last week, I had the pleasure of visiting Northwest Iowa Community College, MMCRU's iTech Center, and Buena Vista University's Ag Experiment Center. I enjoyed learning more about their technical training and agriculture programs!

I'm committed to making sure vaccines are distributed to every corner of our district. Last week, I joined fellow Iowa Representatives Ashley Hinson, Mariannette Miller-Meeks, and Cindy Axne in urging the U.S. Department of Health and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prioritize Iowa's federally qualified community health centers in the next round of their vaccine program.

BONUS

It’s so great to see Iowa businesses like Pizza Ranch growing and adapting in light of pandemic-related challenges. I'm thankful for all the work they do to support our rural communities. Of course, I'm also very thankful for their delicious cactus bread!
 
 

We are government together, and I am here to serve you. Your thoughts, concerns, and comments are very important to me. Always feel free to call (202) 225-4426 or visit my website at feenstra.house.gov.

February 20, 2021

DEEP FREEZE 2021 This week, Oklahoma endured some of its coldest days on record. I hope that everyone is staying warm and taking the necessary precautions to ensure their safety. I would encourage you to check in on loved ones and neighbors. We are all in this together. 
This winter weather has highlighted a major reality: our country does not have enough readily available energy at its disposal. Unfortunately, overregulation has limited coal and nuclear production while increasing our dependence on unreliable sources. This results in fewer energy options during a time when we need as many options as possible. American families should not be forced to pay the price of the socialist Left's ""Green New Deal"" policies that will increase energy costs, eliminate reliable energy sources, and destroy good-paying jobs.
For ranchers and producers who have experienced livestock loss as a result of the winter weather, the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture is now offering disaster assistance through the Livestock Indemnity Program (LIP). LIP payments are equal to 75% of the average fair market value of the livestock. For questions about this program or how to apply, call the Oklahoma FSA office at: 405-742-1130 or click here to learn more. 
HAPPENING IN THE HOUSE This week, I reintroduced my bill, H.R. 1064 the Cable Transparency Act as part of the House Energy and Commerce Committee Republican's ""Broadband Connectivity Agenda.""
￼
The coronavirus pandemic has underscored the need to provide reliable internet to all Americans, regardless of zip code. My legislation will ensure greater economic opportunity for rural cable providers while keeping costs low for customers. I was proud to see my bill included in this package that will expand internet coverage to underserved areas, including the Second District.   This week, House Energy and Commerce Committee held a hearing to address broadband connectivity challenges as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
￼
Watch my full Q&A hearing remarks here. 
I was proud to have the chance to pose solutions and deliver results for the American people. House Republicans are working hard to hasten the rollout of new broadband services, particularly in districts like ours where less than 50% of people have access to broadband. It's time for congress to invest in broadband infrastructure in order to level the economic playing field and close the digital divide. 
IT'S TIME TO REOPEN SCHOOLS 
￼
It is clear that the Biden Administration has no intention of following the science with regard to reopening our schools. Instead, President Biden and his socialist cohort have elected to keep moving the goalposts in order to win political points at the expense of our children. This should be simple: our kids need structure, they need community, and they need in-person, specialized learning. Teachers have done an incredible job this year adjusting to remote learning, but it’s time to get back to the classroom.   Thankfully, most Oklahoma schools have been open with COVID-19 restrictions. Our in-person learning model can serve as an example for other states looking to bounce back from pandemic closures. The Biden Administration must look past the partisanship and follow the science to get our kids back on track.    
RAISING THE WAGE IS NOT THE ANSWER  
￼
In under one month, the Biden Administration has revealed their partisan agenda, namely, appeasing socialist Democrats. At this critical point when our country is in dire need of economic recovery, the far-Left has decided the solution is to skyrocket the minimum wage to a federally-mandated $15 per hour.
Pelosi Democrats have continually tried to force their one-size-fits-all policies onto American workers, but the minimum wage mandate is a step too far. Raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would increase the federal deficit by $54 billion, threaten the livelihoods of millions of small business employees, and raise the prices of goods and services. This radical idea would hurt American workers and their families. We need to create jobs, not destroy them. 
CHEROKEE HEALTH HEROES APPRECIATION WEEK
￼
It’s Cherokee Health Heroes Appreciation Week! As many Oklahomans know, much of the success of the COVID-19 vaccine distribution in our state can be attributed to the many healthcare workers in Cherokee Nation. Please join me in celebrating these remarkable heroes and the work they do to keep us all safe! Their efforts have contributed to Oklahoma being a top 10 state for vaccine distribution in the country. 
HONORING THE LEGACY OF RUSH LIMBAUGH 
￼
This week, our nation mourned the loss of conservative radio icon Rush Limbaugh. Rush will be remembered as one of the most influential media figures in American history, and my thoughts and prayers remain with his wife, Kathryn and his entire family. In his honor, I was proud to join my House GOP colleagues in signing a House resolution commemorating his lifetime of achievements on behalf of the American people. Rush was a titan for conservative leadership, and he will be sincerely missed. 
WHERE ARE YOU IN DISTRICT 2?
￼

Communities all across the Second Congressional District of Oklahoma are full of things that make them unique and I want to highlight some of them. Every week on my Facebook page, I will post an up-close photo of a landmark somewhere in the district with a clue to where it is. I encourage everyone to put their best guess in the comments. The correct answer will be right here, in my weekly e-newsletter.
￼
This landmark is the Thunderbird Youth Academy, offered through the National Guard and the Oklahoma Military Department. Established in 1993, the Thunderbird Youth Academy provides leadership opportunities for student mentors, giving students the skills they need to become positive role models in their communities. Many constituents guessed this landmark correctly, including Brandi Burkhalter, Billy Sheofee, and Kayla Barnes.   Stay in touch by visiting my Facebook and Twitter pages and as always, don’t hesitate to contact me if I can help in any way. 
Thank you, ￼

2/20/21 12:06,Rep. Grothman Newsletter- Workplace Choice for Individuals with Disabilities,"￼

 
Workplace Choice for Individuals with Disabilities
 
For avid readers of my newsletter, you may have noticed that the title of this section is the same as the title of a section in last week's newsletter. I would like to again highlight the importance of this issue and let you know that I am continuing to fight for workplace choice and flexibility for individuals with disabilities.
 
This week, I joined Congressman Bryan Steil (WI-01), Congresswoman Diana Harshbarger (TN-01) and Congressman Madison Cawthorn (NC-11) in sending a letter to President Joe Biden expressing our concern over the threat of elimination of section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act.
 
You can read more about why keeping section 14(c) in place is so important by clicking here. Briefly, this allows certain employers known as Community Rehabilitation Providers (CRPs) to employ individuals with disabilities at a special minimum wage. I have visited all eight CRPs in Wisconsin's Sixth District, and at all of them, the individuals who work there tell me that they enjoy their work not because of the paycheck, but because of the dignity that comes from completing an honest day's work. They often live with family members and receive other assistance to ensure a comfortable living, so their job is a way to be productive with their friends instead of a way to make ends meet.
 
Our letter outlines why these jobs are so important and warns the President that provisions in the $1.9 trillion ""COVID relief"" bill could lead to the elimination of section 14(c) and the termination of these jobs.
  
￼
  
Click the image to read the full letter
  
Here are some common misconceptions about CRPs that were included in last week's newsletter, too.
 
Q: Don't individuals with disabilities deserve enough money to live?
A: Yes. However, individuals who work at CRPs under 14(c) certificates have access to benefits like Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid.
 
Q: Why do these individuals work at a CRP if they don't need the money?
A: For anyone, having a steady job and earning a paycheck is a point of pride. These individuals deserve the dignity that comes from feeling productive and contributing to society.
 
Q: Why don't these individuals get a job outside of the CRP? 
A: Many do! CRPs are set up to assist individuals with disabilities in their work and teach them valuable skills, including how to operate in the workplace. Many people work for a CRP for a period of time, then use those skills to get a job elsewhere. Most people who do gain employment elsewhere, however, are only able to work four or five hours per week, so many retain their job at the CRP in addition to working part-time for another employer.
 
Q: Shouldn't individuals with disabilities be paid $15/hour instead of the CRP's profits going toward making the executives richer?
A: CRPs are most often non-profit and money they do make is reinvested back into the company to assist the employees. I have been told separately and on more than one occasion by different CRPs in Wisconsin's Sixth District that if government regulations require CRPs to pay $15/hour, they would likely be forced to lay-off all employees and close their doors permanently.
 
Q: Why would it be bad if CRPs closed permanently?
A: The individuals who work there would lose their job and many would be relegated to adult daycare. Employees of CRPs all over the Sixth District have told me that while it's nice to have a paycheck and some spending money, their favorite part about having a job is that they get to be with their friends at work. This support system is not available to them with other employers, which is why many have more than one job.
 
Career and Technical Education Month
 
I often talk about the importance of career and technical education (CTE). It is particularly important to me as the representative for Wisconsin's Sixth Congressional District because our district has more manufacturing jobs than any other congressional district.
 
As a member of the House Committee on Education and Labor, I have spoken with Members of Congress from other states about their CTE systems and have participated in hearings examining best practices for CTE and apprenticeship programs. I can confidently say that Wisconsin's CTE system is among the best in the country!
 
We still, however, have a skilled labor shortage. Too often, high school students are pushed into thinking that traditional four-year college degrees are the only way to succeed in life. Many would graduate in less time, accumulate less debt and make more money if they had initially pursued a CTE degree. I have heard stories around Wisconsin from people in their 30s and 40s who got a four-year degree, didn't like their job and went back to school to learn a trade. While it's good that they now have a job they love, it's not uncommon that they are still saddled with student loan debt from their four-year degree, which they would not have had if they had pursued a trade right after high school.
 
February is Career and technical Education Month in Wisconsin. Let's support our state's top-tier manufacturing industry and A+ CTE system by highlighting the importance of CTE and that pursuing a career in the skilled labor market is a great option for everyone, including recent high school graduates.
  
￼
  
 
Solid Start Program
 
The men and women in the armed forces serve our country proudly and patriotically. Often, however, there are questions and complications when transitioning from military to civilian life. That is why the Veterans Benefits Administration established the Solid Start Program to help veterans navigate this transition.
 
Solid Start exists to provide information about the benefits available from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), give guidance and support and answer questions veterans may have about this new chapter in their lives.
 
Please feel free to forward my newsletter or this link to more information on the program to a veteran you know or a service member who is preparing to enter civilian life.

Dear Friend,

It was great to be back home in California’s 39th District this week meeting with constituents. Before next week, I wanted to share a few quick updates on my work for you in Congress. Take a look:

Fighting to Bring Targeted COVID-19 Relief Directly to CA-39 Communities
 

I am committed to providing targeted COVID-19 relief that can directly go to the cities I represent across Los Angeles, Orange and San Bernardino counties in CA-39.
  
Our cities’ ability to receive aid shouldn’t be in Sacramento’s hands. This week, I wrote an op-ed for the Orange County Register explaining why I support direct aid to local governments, businesses and families who continue to struggle during COVID-19.
 
I’m working in Congress to support our community during COVID-19, expand access to vaccines, tests, PPE, mental health resources and more. The only way we will get through this pandemic is by working together. Read my full thoughts for the Orange County Register HERE. 

Demanding Answers for Californians on Vaccine Distribution Failures

 

 
 

A large number of California’s COVID-19 vaccines remain unused or unaccounted for. The lack of a consistent strategy for vaccine distribution is hurting public health and safety for our communities and has led to one of the slowest COVID-19 vaccine rollouts per capita in the nation.

I led a letter with House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy (CA-23) and the California GOP delegation to demand accountability and answers. Learn more HERE. 

Reforming the WHO, Standing Up to China, Fighting COVID-19
 

Taiwan is a strong ally of the United States and has a decades-long record of leading in global health security.Taiwan had observer status in the World Health Organization (WHO) from 2009 until 2017, until its status was revoked due to pressure from the People’s Republic of China.

I introduced a bipartisan bill this week with Rep. Brad Sherman (CA-30) and over 30 other bipartisan Members of Congress to help Taiwan regain its observer status. This will allow Taiwan to receive and share up-to-date information on COVID-19 with other countries in the WHO. Learn more HERE.

Grand Opening of the new Yorba Linda Chamber of Commerce Building
 

As a member of the House Small Business Committee and a former small business owner, I know the struggles small business owners face and the value they create. I was honored to participate in the opening for the new home of the Yorba Linda Chamber of Commerce at the historic Trueblood Home, and I look forward to working with the Yorba Linda Chamber to help local businesses succeed.

Countdown to Mars with Rowland Unified School District
 

Today’s students are tomorrow’s creative problem solvers that will lead our nation to new heights and unlock the mysteries of outer space. While at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory Research Laboratory, I caught up with students at Giano Intermediate School and Alvarado Intermediate School to watch NASA’s Perseverance Rover land on the surface of Mars and talk about the importance of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) education. I’m proud to support research and innovation on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee in Congress. You can watch the rover land HERE.

Calling for Hearings on Following the Science to Safely Reopen Schools

 

 
 

I joined a letter with my fellow Republican colleagues on the House Science, Space, and Technology Committee urging Chairwoman Eddie Bernice Johnson (TX-30) to hold hearings during next week’s House session on following the science to safely reopen schools for in-person learning.

Parents, teachers, students, and local school officials deserve to know more about the factual, scientific information on how schools can safely be open during the COVID-19 pandemic, and also to consider recent research on the mental and emotional impact prolonged virtual learning has on children. Learn more HERE.

COVID-19

I am committed to helping California's 39th District get through the COVID-19 pandemic better than before. As we work to safely reopen communities and get people back to work, I will do all that I can to make sure my constituents receive the relief you deserve.

Vaccines are currently available for CA-39 residents ages 65+.

A Critical First Step
 
   Dear Neighbor,  We have been calling for investigations into New York State’s handling of nursing homes and the deaths of seniors for months. While it is long overdue, the FBI and U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York have opened an investigation into Governor Andrew Cuomo’s disastrous nursing home edicts, and the subsequent cover-up.  The evidence cannot be ignored any longer, and the FBI and Department of Justice clearly recognize that as well. This is a critical first step, and we’re pleased our calls for justice are being heard. I’ve said it before and I will say it again – Cuomo’s COVID cover-up is not political, it’s just plain wrong.  While this federal probe moves forward, more can and should be done. That is why we are pushing for the truth, and working on different avenues to use all the tools at our disposal. We were sent to Washington to protect our communities, and if we can’t agree as Democrats and Republicans to investigate fraud, corruption and the deaths of our parents and grandparents, then we have become negligent in our duties.  We will continue our push for justice for the families of loved ones lost to this avoidable tragedy.  Until Next Time,  Tom

2/20/21 18:00,ICYMI: What I'm Doing to Drain the Swamp,"
 

It's Time to Drain the Swamp.﻿
 
 
 

Friend, 
 
Washington is broken. One of the main reasons why is because members of the DC swamp have more incentive to serve special interests than their constituents. Until we fix this corrupt incentive structure, the jerseys may change, but the results will stay the same. 

That's why I introduced common-sense reforms that would help drain the swamp and make our government function the way our Founders intended it to. These bills would dramatically upend ""business-as-usual"" in Washington by: 

	•	Forcing Congress to pass a balanced budget, 
	•	Establishing a five-year lobbying ban on members of Congress and high-ranking staff, 
	•	Terminating tax-payer funded pensions, and
	•	Codifying President Trump's 2017 Ethics Pledge into law. 

I discussed these ideas at length last week with Jay Weber on WISN Radio, but the purpose is clear: we need to make sure members of Congress need to serve the people, not the swamp. 

Our time in Washington should be viewed as a deployment, not a career. And while there's more to be done (like imposing term limits on members of the House and Senate), these bills are an important first step towards making serving in Congress about just that: service. 

Semper Fi,
 

P.S. Check out the Washington Examiner article for more information on my efforts to drain the swamp.

Recovering After the Storm
Resources and Information to Move Forward
 
 
Since severe weather hit early this week, I have witnessed the incredible kindness of Texans in Collin County and across the state. Neighbors have taken in strangers, friends have driven great distances to deliver firewood and supplies, and restaurants have provided warm meals to those without. I’ve worked with city governments, county officials, and local community partners to help ensure Collin County communities and residents have the supplies and information needed to get through this storm.
 
Temperatures may be rising, but this disaster is not over. In the coming weeks, federal assistance will be crucial as we begin to recover. I’m grateful to Governor Greg Abbott for requesting, and President Joe Biden for quickly approving the Emergency Declaration to deliver desperately needed resources to our state.
 
As we begin to rebuild from this natural disaster, I wanted to make sure you had information to help navigate the first steps of recovery. Please review the details below and, as always, reach out to my office if you need assistance.
 
Our community is strong, and we will rebuild together.

Dear Friend,

Missouri has lost one of its favorite sons, and the country has lost a hero. For over three decades, Rush Limbaugh inspired millions of people and was a leader of the conservative movement. He guided generations of us towards a deeper love of America and enduring respect for the Constitution and the liberties and freedoms we enjoy.

“With talent on loan from God,” as he used to say, Rush was able to cut through the spin and propaganda to provide clarity in a complicated world unlike anything we’ve ever seen. Even though he may no longer be with us, his presence and influence will continue well into the future...KEEP READING HERE

Thank you Deputy Bresnahan and Major Cozad for going above and beyond to serve the citizens of Iron County.

Winter is in full swing here in Southern Missouri with most counties seeing several inches of snow and sub-zero temperatures. Thank you to every community member who has dedicated their time to keeping our roads clear, homes warm, and neighborhoods safe this winter.

The Congressional Art Competition is back! Now entering its 38th year, each Member of Congress gets to display work from a local artist in the U.S. Capitol for one year. The deadline to submit is March 15th. Call our Farmington (573-756-9755) or West Plains office (417-255-1515) for more details.



 IN CASE YOU MISSED IT

￼
 
I led 26 members, along with Rep. James Comer, in introducing a resolution demanding President Biden turn over all documentation about how much previously enacted COVID-19 funding remains unspent. The American people need a thorough and accurate accounting of the trillions of dollars already approved before being asked to foot the bill for $2 trillion more.

￼

As a result of Biden’s bailout package, $30 billion will be cut from Medicare next year alone, which will be devastating for our seniors and the providers who care for them. Last week in the Ways and Means Committee, I offered an amendment to notify providers of these impending cuts. Democrats blocked my amendment. They chose to put politics over people. Our seniors deserve better than this bill.

￼

We have over a trillion dollars in unspent funds from the last package Congress approved. What Democrats are really seeking is a massive taxpayer-funded down payment on their progressive wish-list. Let's get real about this bailout package. Of the $1.9 trillion Dems are asking for, less than 9% is going towards public health needs like vaccinations.

This Week in Washington 
 
 
WASHINGTON D.C. - Here's what's happening...
 Top Stories
 
 
Open Borders are NOT America First
 
￼
 
Gosar Fighting Democratic Border Policies:
Congressional Democrats unveiled an “immigration reform” bill which provides amnesty to more than 14.5 million illegal aliens already in our country.  The Biden Administration also announced it will begin immediately releasing into Yuma County 50 illegal aliens on a daily basis. With no background check or COVID-19 health screening, these released illegal aliens pose a serious security and public health risk. If we are to take seriously the state and County’s efforts to rein in this pandemic, then releasing 50 potentially positive cases into Arizona every day is a threat to public health and constitutes an emergency. To counter these harmful policies, this week I signed onto legislation which would make permanent a policy to hold aliens arrested crossing the border in Mexico and penned a letter to the Yuma County Sheriff  demanding local law enforcement detain illegal aliens and return them to their country of origin.
 
 
 
Ending Forever Wars
 
￼
 
Gosar Pushes to Bring Troops Home:
This week, the House Committee on Oversight and Reform Subcommittee on National Security held a hearing evaluating America’s future in Afghanistan. The hearing focused on a report with a troubling conclusion: the need to maintain American military presence in Afghanistan. I am deeply bothered by this finding.  After twenty years of war, the United States has nothing to show for over $1 trillion taxpayer dollars spent, almost 2400 soldiers killed and over 20,000 seriously wounded.  At a time when tens of millions of Americans are unemployed and where our infrastructure is in disrepair, we need to prioritize and spend our limited funds here in the United States.  The Biden administration has no strategy for victory and 20 years of intervention has proven there is no plan to win and leave.  This endless war needs to end now.  
 
 
Protecting Our Elections
 
￼
 
Stop Foreign Donations Affecting Our Elections Act:
I introduced H.R. 1127, the Stop Foreign Donations Affecting Our Elections Act, which closes loopholes in election law allowing foreign entities to make online campaign contributions, a long-outlawed practice. To close these loopholes and eliminate foreign monetary influence in our elections, this common-sense legislation amends Section 302 of the Federal Elections Campaign Act of 1971 to require both the disclosure of the Credit Verification Value (CVV) number printed on the back of a credit card along with the billing address for all online contributions. The CVV is linked to the zip code of the credit card which can be used to detect foreign donors.  Online contributions lacking the CVV number will be prohibited. This simple fix to existing law will help ensure that any person making online donations is an American citizen making our electoral system safer and more transparent.
 
 
Giving Back to Those Who Gave All for Us
 
￼
            Pictured above is Judge Jeffrey Singer and graduating veterans.
 
Kingman Veterans Treatment Court Graduation:
One of the most rewarding aspects of my job is recognizing the heroes who defend our freedoms. This week, a member of my team, Jeff Timm, presented Congressional certificates on my behalf to the graduating veterans at the Kingman Veterans Treatment Court.  Sadly, one in five veterans has symptoms of a mental health disorder or cognitive impairment caused from combat service. Veterans Treatment Centers address the treatment needs of justice-involved veterans by providing a dignified and important alternative to traditional criminal processing.  I am very proud of these veteran graduates!
 
 
 
Other Highlights From This Week...
 
Democrats continued to pursue more partisan, COVID spending by rejecting my amendments to curb blue state bailouts. I also joined my Republican colleagues in a resolution requiring the Biden Administration to account for all unspent COVID-19 funding as Democrats barrel towards another $1.9 trillion.
On Wednesday, we mourned the passing of conservative radio icon Rush Limbaugh. Over three decades, Rush shifted the conservative landscape and reshaped the political narrative. My thoughts and prayers are with his family, who I hope will take comfort in knowing that his mark on this world will not long be forgotten. Thank you Rush, rest easy.

THIS WEEK ON BUDDY'S BRIEFING

This week on Buddy's Briefing we discuss a busy week in Georgia, improving rural broadband and more.

NURSING HOMES SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROTECTED FROM COVID-19. INSTEAD, THEY WERE GIVEN A DEATH ORDER.

Before I was elected to Congress, I worked as a consultant pharmacist for nursing homes for more than 20 years. This week I wrote an op-ed in the Washington Examiner about how nursing homes should have been protected from COVID. Instead, in New York, they were given a death order. 

Click here to read it. 

Before I was elected to Congress, I worked as a consultant pharmacist for nursing homes and long-term care facilities for more than 20 years.

I reviewed each patient’s medication therapy on a monthly basis, monitored their lab work, made recommendations to physicians for dosage adjustments and drug therapy, and monitored for drug toxicity and interactions. I assisted and instructed nurses in the proper techniques of drug administration and consulted with them when called on for patient-specific concerns. I also consulted with family members and answered their questions about drug therapies for their loved ones.

Tragically, though, nursing homes and long-term care communities are often susceptible to fast-spreading illnesses. One winter, a nursing home I serviced did not order the flu vaccine in time. As a result, nearly 25% of the residents were killed by the virus. This was absolutely devastating, but it’s not an isolated incident.

It is well known how horrific and deadly it can be if a contagious disease is allowed to spread in these facilities, and COVID-19 has been no exception.

When the coronavirus first made its way to our shores from China, it hit nursing homes hard in Washington state. Common protocols to protect the residents of these facilities from outbreaks were thrown to the wayside, and lives were lost.

Shortly after the Washington state outbreak, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued an order that forced nursing homes and long-term care facilities to accept COVID-19 positive patients from hospitals.

This was a death order. After that order was issued, COVID-positive residents were admitted back into nursing homes, and the virus spread like wildfire.

It was originally reported that the order resulted in over 8,000 avoidable deaths. Cuomo, of course, denied all responsibility and claimed he was following federal guidance. However, PolitiFact even rated this claim “mostly false.”

It has now come to light that there was a Cuomo cover-up. The New York state attorney general, a Democrat, investigated the Cuomo administration and found that it purposely underreported deaths in long-term care facilities by up to 50%. The attorney general found the nursing home order issued in March actually contributed to more than 12,000 deaths.

Soon after the attorney general’s report was released, Cuomo’s administration finally confirmed that thousands more nursing home residents died of COVID-19 than the state had previously acknowledged.

When asked about the cover-up and his deadly policies, Cuomo heartlessly responded, “who cares” where they died? “They died.”

Knowing the families of the nursing home residents I cared for, I know they would care, just as I’m sure the thousands of families who lost loved ones in New York care. I’m sure they are devastated, and they want and deserve answers.

Throughout the pandemic, the media glorified the governor. He wrote a book about leadership during the pandemic and commissioned a self-aggrandizing poster. He even came all the way down to my hometown of Savannah, Georgia, last year to lecture us on public health. All while his own failed policies were killing people, and his administration was distorting numbers to hide the deaths.

Those responsible must be held accountable. Elderly people died alone, sick with no one to hold their hands or administer last rites. Grieving family members couldn’t even hold funerals to bury the dead. And this was preventable.

Congress must ensure this is never allowed to happen again. Thinking about my patients in nursing homes who I knew over the years, I will do everything in my power to help.

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCXCX

Tuesday, February 16, 2021:  I’m in Atlanta today and tomorrow as I’m meeting with supporters in the area and visiting the State Capitol.  After a morning filled with visits throughout the area as well as a GOP House Budget Committee member call where we discuss developments with the $1.9 trillion COVID package that the Democrats are ramming through Congress without bipartisan input, I head to the State Capitol. 
￼
Rep. Carter meeting with Governor Brian Kemp
My first meeting is with Governor Brian Kemp as we discuss a number of issues such as the pandemic relief response including the progress of the vaccination rollout, the legislative session and recent Medicaid developments.  Next, I have a meeting with representatives of SK Innovations, the parent company of SK Battery America, that has invested $3.6 billion in a plant in Commerce in Northeast Georgia that will employ 2,600 people, to discuss their progress.  The SK Battery America plant in Commerce will manufacture ion batteries to be used in electric vehicles (EV) and is one of the biggest investments ever in the State of Georgia by a foreign company.  Afterwards, I head back to the Governor’s office where I witness the swearing in of four members of the Board of Directors of the Georgia Ports Authority, Don Grantham from Augusta, David Cyr from Perry, Alec Poitevint from Bainbridge and Chris Womack from Atlanta. 
￼
Rep. Carter with the Board of Directors of the Georgia Ports Authority
Afterwards, I head to more meetings around the area before joining in on an Energy and Commerce (E&C) Committee virtual meeting with Health and Human Services (HHS).

Wednesday, February 17, 2021:  I’m back at the State Capitol this morning as I host a breakfast for members who represent districts within the First Congressional District and catch up with them on the progress of their work.  Afterwards, I head to the State Senate daily pre-meeting where I visit with old friends and offer them encouragement as they endure this stressful session.  Next, I have a very productive meeting with Lt. Governor Geoff Duncan as we catch up before he gavels in the State Senate for their daily business. 
￼
Rep. Carter addresses the Georgia State Senate
After a visit to the office of my longtime friend, House Majority Leader Rep. Jon Burns (R-Newington), I head to the State Senate where I have the honor of addressing my former colleagues and welcome new members from the First Congressional District, Sen. Billy Hickman (R-Statesboro), Sen. Sheila McNeil (R-Brunswick) and Sen. Russ Goodman (R-Homerville).  Next, I head to more visits before joining in on an E&C Communications and Technology (C&T) Subcommittee virtual hearing on broadband solutions to pandemic problems.  A link to my questions can be found here.  

Thursday, February 18, 2021:  After traveling back from Atlanta last night, I’m back in the District this morning and I head to Jesup in Wayne County for a presentation at the Wayne Memorial Hospital where representatives from the afore mentioned SK Battery America are donating 1,000 N-95 respiratory masks to the hospital.  A community-oriented company that strives to be a great corporate citizen, SK Battery America wanted to help Georgia communities with much needed Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) during the pandemic. Needless to say, Wayne Memorial CEO Joe Ierardi was most grateful to receive the much-needed equipment. 
￼
Rep. Carter meeting with Jesup Mayor David Earl Keith
After stopping in for a visit with my good friend, Jesup Mayor David Earl Keith, I head to Hinesville in Liberty County to the Liberty Regional Medical Center for another presentation by SK Battery America of 1,000 N-95 respiratory masks.  With numerous representatives from the hospital in attendance, SK Battery America presents the much-needed PPE that will certainly be put to good use during the pandemic.  While still at the hospital, I record this week’s edition of Buddy’s Briefing before heading to the monthly meeting of the Liberty County Chamber of Commerce where I am honored to be the guest speaker.  After a great visit with this fine group of business leaders, I head back to our Savannah District office. 
￼
Rep. Carter at the PPE donation to Liberty Regional Medical Center
During the drive, I join in on a virtual meeting of the conservative Republican Study Committee (RSC) where we hear from former Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs, H.R. McMaster.  Once back in our Savannah District office, I have an on-camera interview with WJCL-TV in Savannah to discuss current issues before meeting with my good friend, First District Republican Party Chairman Carl Smith.  Afterwards, I join in on a GOP Conference call before joining in on a virtual call with Healthcare Leadership Council members as we discuss their legislative priorities for the year.  My final call of the day is with my good friend, Dave Barron, Chairman of the bipartisan International Conservation Caucus Foundation (ICCF), a foundation that works to advance U.S. leadership in international conservation through public-private partnerships, awareness-raising among policy-makers, and support for tougher policies on conservation and natural resource management.  

Friday, February 19, 2021:  After my weekly Band of Brothers bible study in Garden City early this morning, I join in on a virtual meeting with Georgia Equality, the state’s largest organization working to advance fairness, safety and opportunity for LGBTQ communities as they share with me their legislative priorities for the year.  Afterwards, I have a virtual call with members of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) to hear of their legislative priorities which primarily revolve around funding for infrastructure projects in our country.

2/21/21 10:31,"The Need for Bipartisanship, Vaccination Update and Other Helpful Information","
 
 
 

February 21, 2021
 

Dear Neighbor, 
 
I know many Americans and small businesses are still hurting and I want to work in a bipartisan manner to help them. However, there is still $1 trillion in unspent funds from the first five bipartisan packages that have been signed into law in the past year. We need to evaluate what is working, determine where the biggest need exists, and ensure accountability as well as transparency.  Relief should be temporary, targeted and tied to COVID-19. However, this is proving very challenging. In our most recent Committee hearing in which we reviewed plans for a new pandemic relief measure, Democrats blocked every single Republican amendment to the pandemic relief package including:
 
	•	Plans to ensure distribution of 2 million vaccines to people per day during the next 100 days 
	•	An agreement to set aside vaccines specifically for teachers
	•	Increased transparency over vaccine allocation
	•	Enhanced Mental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment for youth
 
I know many of my Democratic colleagues agree with some of these amendments. We have worked on similar measures together in the past.  However, the Speaker and Leader of the Senate are demanding the use of a partisan and polarizing approach, which is very disappointing. The next step when we return to Washington this week will be a Floor vote on a highly partisan package. This package is full of spending items that have nothing to do with the pandemic. It is nothing more than a liberal wish list that puts their political agenda before the needs of American workers, students, and families. Using the suffering of Americans to score political points is wrong, and I hope my colleagues will rethink this strategy. There is room to find common ground on the type of relief our country needs. 

 Continue reading for a brief overview of important information!
 

Vaccinating Seniors, Veterans and Others with Underlying Health Conditions
 
As of last Friday, more than 2.5 million Floridians have been vaccinated. We continue to increase those numbers every day. While the State of Florida is still currently prioritizing seniors and medical personnel, I am optimistic that eligibility will be able to be expanded soon as more of this most high-risk group is vaccinated. In the interim, I will continue doing everything I can to increase vaccine production and distribution to Florida. Here are a few significant developments:
 
While inclement weather throughout the country caused some temporary vaccination delays for seniors last week, I am encouraged that Florida is now slated to receive an additional 41,000 doses of vaccine this coming week.  I am also excited about this federal and state partnership which will start March 3rd. It will offer even more daily vaccine appointments throughout Tampa Bay.  You can register for those appointments by visiting the state pre-registration portal.
 
Additionally, we are making significant progress with vaccinating Veterans. As the VA celebrates the vaccination of the one millionth Veteran nationwide, our own local VA systems are continuing to lead the way. While Bay Pines and Haley are now making appointments for all Veterans 65 and older, they are hoping to expand to Veterans under 65 with high risk conditions very soon. 

Where to Register by County

Pasco seniors have a few options for vaccination. They can register through the Pasco County health department’s portal. Then at 2:00 p.m. on Sundays the county releases appointment slots. Seniors can log on at exactly 2:00 p.m. and try to register for one of the slots. They are usually gone within 5 minutes. They can also pre-register for the state’s portal and reserve their space in line. The state will contact them once it is their turn for a vaccine. Additionally, seniors can register through Publix, Walmart, or Winn Dixie. I would suggest trying each approach until an appointment is secured.  

Pinellas seniors have similar options. They can register through the Pinellas County health department’s portal. County health officials are contacting those who have pre-registered as appointments become available.  They can also pre-register for the state’s portal and reserve their space in line. The state will contact them once it is their turn for a vaccine. Additionally, they can register through Publix and Walmart. 
 
Hillsborough seniors can pre-register for the state’s portal and reserve their space in line. The state will contact them once it is their turn for a vaccine. Additionally, they can register through Publix, Walmart, or Winn Dixie.  

*Note- there are no county residency requirements for any vaccine in the State of Florida, which means residents of all three counties can attempt to secure a slot through any of the options mentioned above. 
 

Preventing Fraud 
 
Sadly, we have also seen a rise in pandemic related scams over the last year. It is critical that we work together to ensure the FTC is able to go after and stop scammers seeking to exploit seniors and other vulnerable populations during the pandemic. We must also continue to educate the public on how to look out for and prevent falling prey to these shameful scams. I will be hosting a virtual forum in early March to share helpful tips. Stay tuned for more information.  
 
I am also working to help these local victims of identity theft and to put safeguards in place to prevent similar fraud within the SBA business loan program. Below is information about one current scam. 
 
 

Advocating for our Nation’s Heroes
 
I was deeply saddened to learn about Major Richard Star's recent passing from lung cancer as a result of his service. It is critical now more than ever for Chapter 61 Veterans to get the benefits they have earned and deserve. I will be reintroducing my bipartisan legislation this week in honor of Major Richard Star, a true American hero. Click here to learn more.  
 

Thank you to all the employers who provided job opportunities to our local Veterans and military families as part of my targeted Job Fair last week. The Veteran community has been disproportionately impacted by high unemployment rates throughout the pandemic, and I was honored to be able to bring together highly skilled applicants with eager employers in Oldsmar.
 
 

Leveling the Playing Field

﻿Florida’s farmers deserve a fair playing field which is why my colleagues and I are reaching out to ask the U.S. Department of Commerce to remedy this new retaliatory tariff on our citrus products.  
 
 

Community Concentration 
 
My team enjoyed attending the Home of Foam Mattress Superstore's ribbon cutting at Gulf View Square with the Greater Pasco Chamber. Congratulations to the Sullivans on this second location of their family-owned business!
 

My team also participated in the grand opening of Kiddie Academy of Wiregrass Ranch, a new educational center in Wesley Chapel. It is always nice to see small businesses expanding. I congratulate owner Maggie Delgado and her staff and welcome them to the community. 
 

Additionally, my team recently had the chance to tour Tecomsys, a local, veteran-owned, small business. Design Engineers Abon Ackie and Frank Vassallo are shown below with some of the products they design and manufacture. TECOMSYS primarily specializes in developing military-grade antennas and receivers. 
 
 

Constituent Corner

I recently received this message from a local realtor who reached out to my office for help with a client who is a Veteran. 

I’m a licensed Florida Realtor in Wesley Chapel. Over the summer I began working with a beautiful family from Maryland. After spending time here in the area, they decided to make Wesley Chapel their forever home. Over the next few months, the more I learned about their story, the more determined I was to make this dream come true; the husband was a combat veteran suffering from severe PTSD and the toll it was taking on the family and ripping them apart. Moving to Tampa to be near one of the nation’s leading VA hospitals and treatment centers for PTSD was their motive to move.

Now, in order to qualify for their home loan here in FL, the lender needed verification that they would have employment here. The husband was given a verbal “no problem”. However, when it came time for his work to produce the letter for his transfer, it became instantly clear that the transfer was going to take more time and “red tape” than had been initially established when her first asked for the transfer and letter for the loan application.

To say he was distraught is an understatement. I decided that I wasn’t giving up so I walked into my broker’s office, told her the story and she said, “Let’s call the Congressman’s office….veteran’s affairs are one of his passions.” We made the call and immediately your staff accepted the task and started looking into how they could help. Within the week he had made calls, sent emails and got my client the transfer he’d been fighting for. As I sit, telling this story, my clients just signed a couple hours ago and will be on their way down to start their new lives here in FL within a few days. To Congressman Gus Bilirakis and your staff, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU! I truly believe you have saved this man’s life and helped hold his family together. Please know that you did more than help a random stranger get a transfer letter.

This is just one example of the work we do each day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!

Sincerely,
 

Gus Bilirakis
Member of Congress

2/21/21 10:50,Answering your questions on vaccines,"
 

Dear friends and neighbors, 

Like the rest of the country, Central Floridians are ready to return to normal life. Reducing the spread of the coronavirus requires each of us to do our part to protect ourselves and each other. So far, we’ve helped reduce our chances of being exposed to the virus or spreading it to others by wearing masks and practicing social distancing. Now, each of us can save lives by taking the vaccine when we’re eligible. 

Many of you have reached out to my office asking for more information on vaccine distribution in our community. This week, I hosted a COVID-19 Vaccine Town Hall to provide you and your family with up-to-date information on the American Rescue Plan, answer your questions and encourage you to take the vaccine when it’s your turn. 

I was joined by several healthcare experts, including Ashley Luck from Walmart, Dr. Vincent Hsu from AdventHealth’s Infection Control Officer, Dr. Steven R. Smith from AdventHealth, Charity Judino from Magnolia Women and Children’s Community Health Center and Tim Cooke from the Orlando VA Healthcare System. Together, we provided information on vaccination phases, sites and appointments. If you have additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact my office. 
 
Watch it here
 
 

Floridians who are eligible can pre-register for a vaccine appointment. After registration, individuals will be notified when appointments become available in their area. The vaccine is safe and effective, and I encourage everyone eligible to get vaccinated. Our community is counting on you! 
Pre-register here

If you live in Polk and Orange Counties, please continue to use their websites. To pre-register in Polk County, click here. To pre-register in Orange County, click here.

Honoring Community Leaders for Black History Month
 

I was thrilled to honor several outstanding individuals for Black History Month who have worked to enrich the lives of those in their communities. From doctors to educators and nurses to public servants, we thank each of them for their contributions and dedication to our Central Florida community. 
 

Supporting Florida's Farmers
 

This week, I was honored to receive the Florida Farm Bureau Award for Outstanding Service during the 116th Congress! I am proud to represent citrus, cattle and farm country and support their efforts to feed America.  
 

Hearing from Polk State College students 

 
 

As chair of the Future Forum caucus, I want to ensure that young Americans have the opportunity to speak to elected officials directly about the issues they face. On Friday, I was joined by Future Forum members and Roosevelt Holmes of the Biden campaign for a town hall with Polk State College students on COVID-19 relief for our youth. We discussed student loan relief, rental assistance for young people and their families, President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, and COVID-19 vaccinations for youth, among other things.

COVID-19 Vaccine Distribution in the District

COVID-19 Vaccines by County

As COVID-19 infections rise in Central Florida, we are working with local officials to provide up-to-date information on vaccinations. For more information on your county's distribution plans, please visit the websites linked below. 

Orange County

Osceola County
Polk County

Florida has many sites that are providing COVID-19 vaccines to eligible persons. The state is prioritizing persons 65 years of age and older, health care personnel with direct patient contact, and residents and staff of long-term care facilities. Please be aware that some locations are only serving very specific populations, such as frontline health care workers. Appointments may be required and vaccine availability will vary from day to day and week to week, as we work to provide vaccines to the most vulnerable first. 
Full list of vaccine sites
 

Federal Retail Pharmacy Program for COVID-19 Vaccination 
 

Vaccines are now available at select Walmart, Sam's Club and Publix locations in our district. If you're eligible, visit the following websites to schedule your appointment: Walmart, Sam's Club, Publix. 

Special Open Enrollment
 
 
 
 
On January 28, in light of the twin health and economic crises caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, President Biden issued an executive order creating a Special Enrollment Period from February 15 until May 15. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs and their job-based health coverage due to the pandemic. During these challenging times, having health coverage is more important than ever. Thanks to President Biden, there is now a Special Enrollment Period to give you the opportunity to enroll in coverage for the remainder of 2021. 

Learn more at HealthCare.gov. 
 

In the face of unprecedented challenges, Central Floridians in our community have shown immense courage. From the heroic efforts of our healthcare workers and first responders to our essential workers and teachers, each of you has helped our community get through the coronavirus crisis. I am proud to be your representative and look forward to our continued efforts to improve our district. 

In Community,
 

Congressman Darren Soto

Dear Friend,  During this week's winter weather, my prayers have been with everyone who is out of power and affected by the cold, ice, and snow. The winter storms and resulting power outages shed light on the need for our country to rethink its energy infrastructure. We must prioritize reliable forms of baseload energy, like coal and natural gas, to keep the power on and heat our homes, hospitals, and businesses.
 
I will continue to combat federal regulations that kneecap our energy sector's ability to operate during extreme conditions. Rather than limiting strong baseload American energy with bureaucratic red tape, we must invest in innovative, new technology to modernize and bolster our energy supply so that it's not only more efficient, but also more reliable. Doing so is vital to ensuring emergencies like those of this week never happen again.
 
Additionally this week, Toyota announced a $210 million investment to upgrade existing engine production lines and create a third shift, which will bring 100 new jobs to the Buffalo plant. I thank Toyota for this welcomed investment in rural America and for their commitment to employing hardworking West Virginians. Together, we are rebuilding and restrengthening our economy as we continue to crush COVID-19!

#LowcountryFirst Newsletter | February 21st, 2021
 

Holding the Line Against COVID-19

Friends,

I spent this week home in the Lowcountry with entrepreneurs, business leaders, and employees all working around the clock to keep their doors open despite the immense challenges they face with COVID-19. They shared their determination to get past this virus and finally get the country moving again.

I’m more determined than ever to make sure their hard work isn’t undermined by Washington. This starts with making sure we’re doing everything we can to beat COVID-19 once and for all.

In light of this, I was disappointed in the Biden administration’s recent alarming signals that it will limit -- and in some cases stop -- border enforcement measures. Not only is this a clear message to the international community that our immigration laws can be violated with no recourse, but it also risks exasperating an already terrible health emergency as numbers in detainment centers grow.

Americans are still struggling to make ends meet under crippling pandemic restrictions. Local, state, and federal authorities are still overwhelmed in their effort to deliver the vaccine to the millions of Americans who need it most. Most children are being kept from returning to school, despite the CDC and other medical experts repeatedly assuring us they're safe to reopen. Congress is preparing to spend trillions of dollars we simply don’t have.

Amid all of this, we cannot risk a new COVID-19 crisis on our southern border. We’ve made too many sacrifices and worked too hard to get to where we are now. We can’t undo this progress, not when we’re finally starting to turn the corner.

This is why I joined with my colleagues on the House Oversight Committee to warn the Biden administration of the unacceptable risks of their reckless decisions, and to demand transparency for the American people. 

You can read our letter HERE.

The Biden administration seems to be more willing to open up our borders than our schools. Their priorities are completely backwards, but mine are not.

My primary mission right now is to help finally end this pandemic so the people of the Lowcountry can finally get back to living their lives. We will defeat this virus! 

Sincerely,

 

Congresswoman Nancy Mace

Actions This Week
 
 
This week I had the pleasure of announcing six grants awarded to the Seventh District. They will support improved critical water infrastructure to better prepare for future storms and allow for continued economic growth in the Seventh District. To learn more about the grants click here. To learn more about federal grants that may be available, click here.
I introduced the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would end the “excruciating suffering and physical pain of unborn babies” from abortion at 20 weeks or older.  
I sent a letter to Corporation for National and Community Service to support the Neighbors to Neighbors grant application. Recently, Neighbors to Neighbors received the grant of $75,000. With this new funding, N2N will be able to provide more volunteer opportunities and capitalize on the skills and expertise of those volunteers living in Horry County. 
 

 
 
Tax Filing Season
 
 
With tax filing season upon us, here is some information regarding Stimulus Checks and how people that did not receive them can claim it on their 2020 tax return through the Recovery Rebate Credit:
	•	The IRS announced that, as required by law, all legally permitted first and second round of Economic Impact Payments have been issued and the IRS now turns its full attention to the 2021 filing season.
	•	Beginning in April 2020, the IRS and Treasury Department began delivering the first round of Economic Impact Payments within two weeks of the legislation. The IRS issued more than 160 million EIPs to taxpayers across the country totaling over $270 billion. In addition, since Congress enacted the COVID-related Tax Relief Act of 2020, the IRS has delivered more than 147 million EIPs in the second-round totaling over $142 billion.
	•	Get My Payment was last updated on Jan. 29, 2021, to reflect the final payments and will not update again for first or second Economic Impact Payments.
	•	Most people who are eligible for the Recovery Rebate Credit have already received it, in advance, in these two rounds of Economic Impact Payments. If individuals didn't receive a payment – or if they didn’t receive the full amounts – they may be eligible to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit and must file a 2020 tax return.
 

 
 
Black History Month
 
 
Joseph Rainey was born into slavery in Georgetown in 1832. His father was a barber and used his earnings to buy freedom for himself and his family, including Joseph. Later, during the Civil War, Joseph was drafted by the Confederacy, but he escaped to Bermuda with his wife and started a business. In 1866 he returned to Georgetown, South Carolina where he became the county’s Republican Party Chairman. Just a few years later in 1870, he was elected to Congress where he served until 1879 making him the longest serving African American Member of Congress in the nineteenth century. Joseph Rainey fought tirelessly for civil rights, education, and economic opportunity for all. He has left behind a legacy that will never be forgotten.
You can learn more about him here.
I also introduced a bill to rename the Georgetown Post Office after Joseph Rainey. Additionally, I co-sponsored a bill with Speaker Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, and Majority Whip Clyburn to name room H150 in the US Capitol after Joseph Rainey.

Announcement for Veterans
 
 
The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021 (NDAA) has added three conditions (bladder cancer, hypothyroidism, and Parkinsonism, or Parkinson-like symptoms) considered to be ‘Presumptive,’ as indicative of Agent Orange Exposure. Veterans generally, but Vietnam Veterans in particular, that were exposed to Agent Orange and have been diagnosed with the three conditions should file a claim for compensation with the VA.  
For those that have already filed a claim related to these conditions, contact our Grand Strand and Pee Dee District Offices for assistance.

Unemployment Assistance 

The Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE) announced this week it will begin rolling out Phase 2 of the extended pandemic benefits provided by the Continued Assistance Act (CAA) on February 20. Phase 2 will allow claimants who exhausted the balance of their federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) and Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) claims on or before December 26, 2020 to receive an additional 11 weeks of benefits as of December 27, 2020. Phase 2 will also include the ability to file new PUA and PEUC claims.

Please note, a maximum of two tickets are available for each household. Tickets are first come, first served and will be mailed to the address you provide.

I look forward to working with the Biden-Harris Administration on many big issues facing this country. In the 117th Congress, I am honored to continue to represent the people of Jefferson County and Adams County as I work to improve the quality of life for all Coloradans. I will serve on four committees in the House – Financial Services; Science, Space and Technology; Rules; and the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress. – where I will work to secure additional COVID relief as well as a robust stimulus package to reboot our economy and address our infrastructure needs.

As we continue to deal with the coronavirus, I encourage you and your family to reach out to my office if you have any issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, the economic downturn, or need help with a federal agency.

2/21/21 13:01,Dave's Weekly Wrap,"
 
 

Friends,

As a life-long pet owner, I want those who commit crimes of animal cruelty brought to justice. As a former prosecutor, I want to make sure the criminals who commit these crimes can’t escalate to committing violence against other people. That's why I joined Rep. Joe Neguse (CO-02) and Rep. Steve Cohen (TN-09) in introducing the Animal Cruelty Enforcement (ACE) Act. 
 

Our bipartisan bill would establish a dedicated Animal Cruelty Crimes section within the Department of Justice (DOJ) to aid in the investigation, enforcement and prosecution of felony animal cruelty crimes. It would also require DOJ to report annually to Congress on the progress made on enforcing animal cruelty statutes.

Sadly, studies show that there is a close link between animal cruelty and violence toward people, especially children. By supporting the DOJ’s efforts to bring charges against perpetrators of animal cruelty crimes, the ACE Act aims to prevent individuals with a propensity for violence from causing further harm to animals or turning that violence against people in their communities.   

Leading the Effort to Prevent Veteran Suicides


Issues surrounding mental health are a complex and unfortunate challenge for so many of our nation’s heroes. In September of 2019, the VA released an alarming report showing that at least 60,000 veterans died by suicide between 2008 and 2017. According to the VA’s most recent annual report, nearly 18 veterans take their own life every day. 

We have the responsibility to reverse that terrible statistic and provide those who have served our country with the care and support they have earned. That's why I partnered with Congressman Andrew Garbarino (NY-02) to introduce the Veteran Suicide Prevention Act. 
 

Specifically, the bill directs the Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) to compile a publicly available review of suicides by veterans in the last five years. The review would include, but would not be limited to:
	•	the total number of veterans who died by suicide during the five-year period;
	•	a summary that includes age, gender, and race;
	•	a list of the medications prescribed to, and found in the systems of, such veterans at the time of their deaths, and a summary of medical diagnoses by VA physicians which led to the prescribing of such medications;
	•	the number of instances in which the veteran was concurrently on multiple medications prescribed by VA physicians;
	•	the percentage of veterans who were not taking any medication prescribed by a VA physician;
	•	the percentage of veterans with combat experience or trauma;
	•	Veterans Health Administration facilities with markedly high prescription and patient suicide rates;
	•	a description of VA policies governing the prescribing of medications; and
	•	recommendations to improve the safety and well-being of veterans.

If you are a veteran in crisis, or know someone who is, please know that free, confidential support is available every hour of every day. You can call the Veterans Crisis Line at 1-800-273-8255, send a text to 838255, or chat online at veteranscrisisline.net. 

Restarting Iran Nuclear Talks Would Be A Historic Mistake

This week, an Iranian-linked militia launched a rocket attack at a U.S. air base in northern Iraq and the U.N. nuclear watchdog revealed that it found uranium particles at two Iranian sites it inspected after months of stonewalling. 

Yet on Thursday, the Administration provided sanctions relief to the Iranian regime and offered to restart nuclear talks. 
 

I strongly oppose these decisions and fear that they will help further pave the way for the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism to become a nuclear power.

America must choose strength when dealing with Iran, not appeasement.

Improving America's Recycling Policies

I’m pleased to report that this past week, I joined my colleagues Rep. Frank Pallone, Jr. (NJ-06), Rep. Rodney Davis (IL-13), and Rep. Haley Stevens (MI-11) as a Co-Chair of the bipartisan House Recycling Caucus. 

As a lifelong resident of Northeast Ohio, I know that recycling is critical to protecting our natural resources like Lake Erie. Sadly, between ever-evolving rules and so many different materials to sort through, nearly a third of all items that are recycled end up in landfills.

That's why, last Congress, I worked across the aisle to introduce legislation that would help households understand how to prevent recyclable materials from ending up in landfills and invest in recycling programs that are successfully keeping our communities clean. 
 

I look forward to working with my fellow Co-Chairs throughout the 117th Congress to improve America's recycling policies and help more folks understand the environmental and economic benefits of recycling. 

God bless and stay well,

Dave

CONGRESSWOMAN MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR'S WEEKLY UPDATE

Happy National Entrepreneurship Week! As part of my Prosperity Tour, I visited Unseen Creatures, a local craft brewery owned and operated by Marco, a Miami native. Right in the heart of Bird Road, Marco opened his small business barely a month before the COVID-19 pandemic and has had to reinvent his business model to keep his doors open. I'm fighting tirelessly on the Small Business Committee to deliver immediate COVID-19 relief to our struggling local job creators!

As you all know, I am so proud to have introduced the bipartisan Fairness for Craft Beverage Producers Act so that local breweries can have full access to Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) Loans! My team and I also hosted a Facebook Live webinar for our local small business owners so they can access the PPP and EIDL programs offered by the Small Business Administration.

I am toured our local public university, FIU, and met with the mayor of one of my absolute favorite communities, the Town of Cutler Bay. 

I look forward to continue addressing your cases, reading your letters, and responding to your comments on Social Media. Please continue to let me know what your thoughts are and never hesitate to reach out to my office. My team is more than happy to assist you with any of your concerns and guide you through any challenges you may have with our federal agencies. 

It is truly the honor of a lifetime to fight for YOU in the halls of Congress.

I CONTINUED MY #PROSPERITYTOUR OF OUR LOCAL 
﻿SMALL BUSINESSES
 

Over 80% of our local businesses employ less than 10 people and over 70% employ less than 5. Our local job creators have been the hardest-hit by COVID-19 and I'll never stop fighting for our local job creators in Congress!

As part of National Entrepreneurship Week, I made my third stop of our #ProsperityTour at Unseen Creatures, a local craft brewery owned and operated by Marco, a Miami native. 

The purpose of our #ProsperityTour is to highlight our community's local enterprises and listen to their experiences throughout the pandemic. 

I'm fighting tirelessly to deliver IMMEDIATE COVID-19 relief to our local small business owners

WE LED A BIPARTISAN INITIATIVE URGING THE US NAVY TO CREATE AN ARTIFICIAL CORAL REEF OFF THE COAST OF FLORIDA
 

I led a bipartisan initiative with my colleague, Rep. Darren Soto (FL-09) of Central Florida, urging the United States Navy to consider preparing and sinking the USS Bonhomme Richard off the coast of Florida where, as an artificial reef, it could become an environmental and economic benefit to the local community and state. 

WE MET WITH THE LEADERSHIP TEAM AT 
FLORIDA INTERNATIONAL UNIVERSITY (FIU)
 

Always great to speak to the amazing team at Florida International University (FIU)! 

It’s truly the honor of a lifetime to represent thousands of FIU grads in our Congressional district and I’m fighting tirelessly to bring as many resources as possible to our brilliant, hardworking students in South Florida. 

Thank you, to President Rosenberg & Vice-President Michelle Lorenzo for welcoming my team and I to the beautiful Modesto Maidique Campus in the heart of Western Miami-Dade!

THE TOWN OF CUTLER BAY IS ONE OF THE GEMS IN OUR COMMUNITY 
 
 

We travelled to the southernmost part of our beautiful district, the Town of Cutler Bay. There, I met with Mayor Tim Meerbot who shared his exciting vision for this community. I saw their habitat restoration efforts o preserve our fragile Pine Rockland ecosystem, a unique South Florida gem.

I look forward to continue working with our local mayors and our residents to deliver results for the South Dade community.

Latest News
Remembering Rush Limbaugh
￼
For decades, conservatives across the country attentively listened to Rush Limbaugh on the airwaves to get his take on the events of the day. Rush fundamentally changed the Republican Party for the better because he was unafraid to stand up to the status quo. His voice, knowledge and influence will be badly missed in the conservative movement. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and loved ones during this difficult time.

Getting our kids back to school
￼
President Biden has dramatically shifted the goalposts on his promise to reopen schools in his first 100 days. He is obviously beholden to teachers unions.
Just recently, CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said, ""There is increasing data to suggest that schools can safely reopen and that safe reopening does not suggest that teachers need to be vaccinated."" Of course, we should do all we can to protect our teachers. But when children and staff wear masks and practice social distancing, the data shows it's safe to reopen schools for in-person learning.
For months, Biden claimed that President Trump wasn't listening to the science. Now, the Biden Administration is in explicit disagreement with the science because he and his fellow Democrats are more worried about granting teachers unions their every wish than helping children and their parents.
As many of us expected, in-person learning has been detrimental for kids' learning, particularly the less fortunate and minorities. Remote learning is also especially difficult for single-parent families who can't work as much because they need to watch their kids. If we want to get the economy back on track, then we need to resume full-time in-person learning IMMEDIATELY. Not just because it's necessary, but also because it is in fact safe enough to do so.
The American people are tired of this charade. My Republican colleagues and I will continue to hold the Biden Administration accountable on this extremely important matter.
If you or your child have been affected by these prolonged school closures, please follow this link to share your story.

Reintroducing the INFLUENCE Act
￼
On Thursday, I reintroduced the Intelligence on Nefarious Foreign Leaders Using Education Networks for Corrupt Enrichment (INFLUENCE) Act. The legislation aims to limit intellectual property theft by foreign nationals at colleges and universities.
The Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property estimates foreign actors steal $300 billion in American intellectual property annually. The Intellectual Property Commission estimates China is responsible for 70 percent of that theft – or $210 billion annually.
The Center for Strategic and International Studies compiled a list of 152 publicly reported cases of Chinese espionage seeking to acquire information from military, government, civilian and academic institutions. Some examples of these instance are listed below:
	•	In November 2020, a professor of internal medicine at Ohio State University and Penn State University pled guilty to neglecting to disclose his ties to a Chinese university when securing grants. Investigators believed this was an effort to share federally funded research with China.
	•	In August 2020, a Texas A&M professor was charged with wire fraud, making false statements and conspiracy while secretly working with the Chinese government while conducting research for NASA.
	•	In May 2020, an engineering professor from the University of Arkansas was arrested for wire fraud as a result of his failure to disclose ties to Chinese institutions.
	•	In January 2020, the Chairman of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Harvard University was charged with making false statements about his ties to the Chinese government.
Existing law requires any gift or contract from a foreign source given to institutions of higher learning valued at $250,000 or more to be reported to the Department of Education. If passed, the INFLUENCE Act would lower that threshold to $50,000. The bill would also require schools to report to the Department of Education on the nature of any contracts with foreign nationals on sensitive projects.
In addition, the measure would establish interagency coordination on the enforcement of any violations exposing U.S. national security projects, and the Secretary of Education would report on best practices moving forward regarding these types of breaches and how best to protect sensitive information. Enforcement mechanisms of the bill include civil action, revoking Title IV funding, and fines.
China is an American adversary – they are not simply ‘competitors’ as President Joe Biden recently stated. We have evidence the Chinese government will stop at nothing to steal American secrets and intellectual property. To stop this, we need to take a closer look at foreign involvement on colleges and universities, which is where a large portion of American research takes place.
Although we have caught many Chinese spies in the act of espionage, who knows how often this practice goes undetected? By lowering the gift and contract threshold to $50,000, we can cast a larger net and catch more foreign operatives in the act of stealing. It is my hope this bill can become law so we can crack down on China’s malicious theft of our secrets and intellectual property.
The text of the bill can be found here.

Kamala Harris continues to lie about vaccine rollout, the media continues to give her cover
Over the weekend Vice President Harris continued to push a lie about President Trump's Operation Warp Speed. Far from leaving them unprepared, this program worked with private industry to produce a miraculously effective vaccine and they did so in record time. Before the Biden Administration even had time to change the program it had delivered over 50 Million doses of the vaccine. That's over half of President Biden's co-opted goal of 100 million shots in his first 100 days.
Dr. Fauci has completely contradicted Harris' claims that they're ""starting from scratch"", yet the D.C. press corps refuses to run one of their famous ""fact check"" articles on this. The Biden administration is trying to write President Trump's accomplishment's out of history. The media's clear bias shows that, unsurprisingly, they are eager to help.

Reintroducing legislation to treat veterans with TBI and PTSD
Last week, I reintroduced the Veterans National Traumatic Brain Injury Treatment Act. The bill would direct the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs to create a pilot program for Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) to treat Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). The Third Congressional District of North Carolina is home to 89,000 veterans – the sixth most in the U.S.
A 2015 study found as many as 500,000 veterans who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan have been diagnosed with PTSD – a number that has grown since the study was conducted. Research also suggests that TBI and PTSD are linked to an increased risk for suicide. An average of 17.6 veterans per day take their own lives according to the 2020 National Veteran Suicide Prevention Annual Report.
HBOT is conducted by placing an individual in a pressurized tank and pumping in a large amount of pure oxygen. By delivering more oxygen to the patient’s lungs, their blood can carry more oxygen to help heal cells in their body, including in the brain. Some people believe HBOT is a viable treatment option for TBI and PTSD.
As a new member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, I wanted my first piece of legislation in the new term to help the men and women in our country who have so bravely defended our freedom, particularly the veterans in my district who suffer from TBI and PTSD. I worked on this issue in the North Carolina General Assembly and now want to take those efforts nationwide. According to the VA, veterans are 50 percent more likely to die by suicide compared to average adults. Sadly, we lose more than 17 veterans a day in this nation to suicide. Our veterans who have bravely seen combat overseas fighting to preserve our freedom deserve better.
While more research needs to be done to determine HBOT’s overall effectiveness in treating TBI and PTSD, I have found that it has helped many veterans get their lives back on track. Most therapies for TBI and PTSD treat just their symptoms. We need to fight for a cure. People who suffer from TBI and PTSD respond differently to different treatments. While HBOT may not help one patient, it could save another’s life. It is my hope that we can expand HBOT for veterans so they can have a larger variety of treatment options at their disposal. My legislation would be a first step in doing exactly that.
The text of the bill can be found here.

Marking up Education and Labor budget reconciliation 
Last week, the Education and Labor Committee completed a markup of the budget reconciliation bill Democrats are using to push through COVID-19 legislation. We finally finished at 4:15am. I offered two amendments to this misguided legislation to try to make it better, but both were unfortunately blocked. The first would prohibit school districts from receiving money under the Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (ESSER) Fund if they do not offer in-person instruction for vulnerable children.
In-person learning has been proven a much more effective environment for children. This phenomenon is disproportionately hurting minority and disadvantaged kids according to a recent study conducted by McKinsey and Company. My commonsense amendment would simply require public schools to offer in-person instruction for the children who have fallen behind the most if these schools want to receive federal funding.
Of course, schools must take the proper precautions to safely reopen. The CDC believes we can safely reopen schools right now if students and teachers wear masks and practice social distancing. In addition, Congress authorized $54 billion for schools in December for the purposes of reopening. We can and should do this for our most vulnerable children at the very least.
The other amendment I offered would strike the $15 minimum wage provision of the bill. First of all, budget reconciliation is a process reserved for spending and revenue programs. The radical proposal to more than double the national minimum wage has absolutely nothing to do with spending and revenue. This provision has no business being in this bill to begin with.
Second, Democrats are living up to their mantra of ‘never let a good crisis go to waste.’ Their constant efforts to push a radical socialist agenda under the pretext of coronavirus relief are inappropriate and dangerous. The non-partisan CBO released a report predicting 1.4 million jobs would be lost as a result of such a steep minimum wage hike. Our country is already experiencing extremely high unemployment due to the pandemic. Deliberately pulling the rug out from under more than a million Americans is the last thing we need to do for our ailing economy. 

Serving as Ranking Member of the Higher Education subcommittee 
￼
A couple days after my last newsletter, I was named the Ranking Member of the Higher Education and Workforce Investment Subcommittee of the House Committee on Education and Labor. As a former member of the Davidson College Board of Trustees as well as being a former small business owner, it is an honor to be the top Republican on this subcommittee.
I look forward to working with my colleagues, as well as institutions of higher education, to address the many pressing issue areas in this subcommittee's jurisdiction, such as the cost of tuition, campus free speech and student athlete protections. I thank my colleagues for giving me the opportunity to lead Republicans on this important panel. 

Yet another misguided Biden executive order
Entitlement programs work better when they are tied to work requirements. That's why the Trump Administration implemented a policy requiring childless, nondisabled adults to work, look for work, perform community service, or take educational classes in order to receive Medicaid. Unfortunately, the Biden Administration is planning to remove this requirement. Programs like Medicaid should be a hand up rather than a hand out. I am terribly disappointed in this decision.

Despite near freezing monsoon weather here on the Outer Banks, I had a great day visiting constituents with Congressman Rob Wittman (VA-1). We met with several Kitty Hawk Officials, Dare County Commissioners and Fishermen to discuss the local issues. Even met up with the crew (including mascot Minnie) from Rasta Rocket from Wicked Tuna!

Touring Jacksonville's second vaccination clinic and helping administer the vaccine
￼
Last Tuesday, I toured the vaccination operation in Jacksonville. They are doing a fantastic job in getting folks through quickly and painlessly (almost!). I was even able to help administer some of the doses myself. As a physician and someone who has already received both doses of the vaccine, I highly encourage everyone to take it as soon as it becomes available to you!

The District 3 Spring Clean!
￼
While driving through the district my wife Wendy and I noted how our beautiful eastern North Carolina has a significant roadside trash problem, and we felt the need to address it. I brag in D.C. that we have the most beautiful district in the country and frankly, given the trash problem we have, it is hard to keep saying that. We attempted to have this day set aside last year but had to cancel due to COVID-19 lockdowns. But the problem now is too dire and so we are moving full steam ahead this year.
I’m asking everyone in North Carolina’s Third Congressional District to come together—Republicans, Democrats and Independents alike—in a bipartisan effort to join me in cleaning up our communities. Please join your local church group, YMCA, civic leaders, rotary club or other community organization to give eastern North Carolina a wonderful spring cleaning. So much of our economy is based upon tourism and we want to showcase how beautiful our district is to the rest of the state and our country. So let’s all pitch in and make eastern North Carolina the beautiful place we know it is.
Third District constituents are encouraged to participate alongside my staff and I and post photos to social media of the trash they have picked up with #SpringCleanTheEast. Those who would like to participate should RSVP by clicking the link here
Participants may receive a follow up email with further instructions.

Speaking at the Corporals Leadership Course Graduation aboard MCAS Cherry Point
￼
It was an honor to be a guest speaker at the Corporals Leadership Course graduation ceremony at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in Havelock. These Marines are now in a position of leadership for the first time in their careers - please join me in wishing them the best in their future endeavors.
After the ceremony, we toured the health clinic on base, which as a physician, I took great interest in. The professionalism with which the Marines in eastern North Carolina conduct themselves is always so impressive. Thank you to the Marines at Cherry Point for a fantastic visit!

Visiting the Winterville Charter School
￼
On February 11th, I made a fantastic (virtual) visit to the Winterville Charter School! They have kept their children in school and delivered on their promise to provide a safe and secure education to their children. Education is an ESSENTIAL activity!!! It was wonderful to hear from the students - they are so excited about their opportunity to learn!

Supporting a new medical school for ECU
￼
Congressman G.K. Butterfield and I wrote a joint letter to North Carolina Speaker of the House Tim Moore and President Pro Tempore Phil Berger expressing support for legislation providing funding for a new Brody School of Medicine at ECU. As a practicing surgeon who has worked with the students and faculty of the Brody School of Medicine, I can attest to the tremendous work they do for the east and the entire state of North Carolina. We desperately need more physicians in North Carolina and the new medical school would produce more doctors to help bridge the healthcare gap in our state. The Brody School of Medicine far outpaces all North Carolina medical schools in students staying in state after graduation. I want to thank Congressman Butterfield for joining me in this bipartisan show of support. It is my hope this legislation makes it across the finish line in the State Assembly.

Constituent Spotlight
Helen Wiegel
￼
Every year we are reminded of how devastating mother nature can be. This year we've already seen a tornado take the lives of three North Carolinians and many in District Three are being confronted with severe flooding this weekend. All of this while far too many have been struggling to recover from storms like Hurricanes Florence and Dorian for years. Fortunately, Helen Wiegel, from Southern Shores, is doing her part to help those recovering from natural disasters. With the help of the Outer Banks Community Foundation she established an endowment fund to give assistance to the community that Helen and her late husband, Joe, came to love. Please join me in sending her our thanks and stay safe this week!

A LONG-TERM SOLUTION TO CHILDHOOD POVERTY
Dear friend, 
Last week, House Democrats finished marking up President Biden’s COVID-19 relief proposal, the American Rescue Plan, preparing it for a floor vote in our chamber next week and for final passage in Congress in March. The package creates a coordinated national strategy to defeat the virus and provides much-needed relief to American families and our economy during this difficult time.  
Included in this bill is a one-year expansion of the Child Tax Credit, a measure I am championing to provide qualifying families with monthly payments of up to $250 per child and $300 for children under 6. While getting this relief to families during the current crisis is important, Congress should next make this benefit permanent to lift millions of children out of poverty.
The Seattle Times recently wrote about why the American Family Act, my proposal to make the Child Tax Credit expansion permanent, should be passed: “The American Family Act would do more than tweak dry tax policy. It would offer struggling families a lifeline…Congress should quickly usher important family relief into law.” You can read the full editorial here.
As always, I am here to help you. If you need assistance at this difficult time, please do not hesitate to contact my Kirkland office at (425) 485-0085. For more updates on what I’m doing for WA-01, you can follow me on social media at the links above.
Take care,  Suzan

2/21/21 14:20,An Update from Congressman David Kustoff,"
 
 

Dear Friends,

This week, I questioned Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev and Reddit CEO Steve Huffman about the market volatility that happened in January with GameStop. I believe it is vital that we ensure adequate protection for everyday investors, and increase their participation in the market going forward. Watch my full questioning by clicking here or the photo below.
 
 

Many West Tennesseans are concerned that the mailbox units the U.S. Postal Service requires for their housing developments do not suit the community’s needs. This week, I introduced the Easy Access to Mail Act which will enable our local communities to work with the USPS to fix this issue. This bill will prohibit USPS from retroactively requiring home builders to install cluster mailboxes at new housing developments and would require one-time approval from a local legislative body regarding the placement of cluster mailboxes.

Texas Begins to Thaw
I was in steady communication with state and local officials this week to ensure Texas got through the unprecedented winter storm. Progress continues to be made, and soon, our power systems will be fully functional again.

Although this was a once-in-a-century freeze, it’s apparent that work must be done to make certain that our state isn’t caught off-guard ever again – that includes a greater investment in natural gas, nuclear energy, and infrastructure.

This should serve as a wake up call for America – in times of disaster, it is critical that we have ample amounts of the only energy source that will undoubtedly get us through the unexpected: fossil fuels. If we had been more reliant on renewable energy sources, like our windmills that froze, circumstances would have been much worse.

To get to the bottom of what happened, I will be working with my colleagues, both in Texas and in D.C., to find solutions and rebuild a stronger system.

Now, our journey to recovery begins. I will continue to do everything I can to make certain Southeast Texas receives the resources necessary to speed this process along and get Texans back on their feet sooner rather than later. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to one of my offices if you need assistance.
Democrats Continue to Support Infanticide

Staying Busy in the Tenth District


It was great to spend time in Hickory with Mayor Hank Guess on Tuesday morning. I was proud to support the BUILD Grant the city was awarded in 2018 and was excited to see firsthand the City Walk and River Walk projects which are partially funded by this grant. Thanks also to the Mayor for presenting me with a book commemorating the Hickory’s 150th Anniversary. On my tour I was joined by the Hickory Daily Record. We discussed what is happening in Washington, including the impeachment and Democrats’ wasteful coronavirus bill that won't help the Tenth District. You can read more from the interview by clicking here.

￼

Later that morning, I was able to visit the Catawba County Emergency Operations Center and get an overview of the county’s COVID-19 response. It was also informative to hear input on the federal response from the county manager, department heads, Sheriff Don Brown, and Commissioners Kitty Barnes, Barbara Beatty, and Sherry Butler. Thanks to all those who are working tirelessly to end this pandemic.

￼

On Wednesday, I joined Troutman officials to visit The Career Academy & Technical School. CATS does an incredible job of educating our students and preparing them for the workforce. Thank you to Principal Larry Rogers, Superintendent Jeff James, and Iredell-Statesville Board of Education Chairman Martin Page for your leadership and dedication to the community.

￼

I ended my morning in Troutman with a tour of C.R. Onsrud with owner Jeff Onsrud. C.R. Onsrud manufactures CNC machinery that is used is many industries around the world. Thanks to Troutman Mayor Teross Young, Councilmen Paul Henkel, George Harris, Eddie Nau, and Town Manager Duck Wyatt for hosting me during my visits and and showing me some of the great things that are happening in Troutman.

￼

At lunch, I stopped by FeedNC where Executive Director Lara Ingram gave me a tour and shared her vision for the future. I am grateful for the tremendous work FeedNC is doing to help their community. Through groceries, meals, and job training, FeedNC is helping their neighbors through tough times.

￼

It is always a pleasure to celebrate with our brave first responders when they receive federal funding. Last week I was able to show my appreciation to the Shepherds Volunteer Fire Department who were awarded two FEMA grants totaling over $1 million. Thank you to Shepherds VFD for keeping our community safe and allowing me to recognize your achievements.

Gamestop Hearing



America’s robust capital markets are part of what makes our nation the best place in the world to start a business. During last week's House Financial Services Committee hearing on GameStop, I spoke about the importance of giving everyday investors greater access to those markets and ensuring Americans from all walks of life can benefit from our economic success.

What I Have Been Reading



Rush Limbaugh, conservative talk radio pioneer, dead at 70

Fox News 

I was saddened to hear of the passing of Rush Limbaugh. Rush was an icon in the conservative movement, speaking directly to millions of Americans daily and revolutionizing the way those on the right consumed news. He has served as an inspiration to many during his courageous battle against stage four cancer in recent years. My prayers are with his family as they mourn. 


‘A path of destruction.’ Three dead after tornado rips through coastal NC community

The News and Observer 

Please join me in praying for all of our neighbors in eastern North Carolina who were affected by Monday night’s deadly tornado. I am grateful to the first responders working to keep the Brunswick County community safe after this devastating storm.  My thoughts are also with all those in Texas and throughout the southern United States who have been impacted by harsh weather conditions.

February 21, 2021 


During Black History Month we honor the legacy and sacrifice of those, famous and not, who through their words, actions, and accomplishments advanced the long struggle for racial justice and equity. That struggle must be ours as we work together to achieve real change and ensure our country finally lives up to the full promise of liberty and justice for all. Big challenges remain, but we have a reason to be hopeful as we enter a new chapter in our nation’s history. Let’s move forward with urgency to complete the work ahead. I’ll be fighting this month and every month to tackle these injustices, and I hope you’ll join me.
Defending our Democratic Institutions
The Senate trial made clear – Donald Trump committed high crimes and misdemeanors against our nation in his incitement of the insurrection on our Capitol on January 6th to overturn the election results. He violated his duty and oath of office to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution – and in fact, his actions flew directly in the face of this most sacred responsibility. The overwhelming documentation provided by the House impeachment managers underscored this truth. That is why I voted to convict Donald Trump. 
I remain deeply troubled by the decision of so many Republican Senators to vote to acquit. If Trump’s conduct was not a crime against the Constitution, what is? Make no mistake – they have inflicted lasting harm on our nation in their failure to hold Donald Trump accountable; they have failed the test of history, and that is likely to haunt us in the years ahead.  
But I am encouraged that this vote did not fall strictly along party lines. In fact, it was the largest bipartisan impeachment vote to convict a president in American history. And I feel certain that the American people know the truth of Donald Trump’s guilt. This trial brought to light his crimes against our Constitution, and these crimes will not be erased. Together, we must work to undo the damage of the Trump era and move forward as a country. 
The Senate trial also highlighted the sacrifices and courage of many Capitol Hill Police Officers, including the heroic actions of Officer Eugene Goodman of Maryland. By redirecting violent rioters away from the Senate chamber on January 6th, Officer Goodman defended our democracy and saved the lives of Senators and staff. He is wholly deserving of the highest civilian honor bestowed by Congress, and I’m glad the Senate acted quickly to pass the legislation I introduced to recognize his quick thinking and bravery with a Congressional Gold Medal. 
Passing an Emergency Plan that Meets the Moment
Our most urgent priority must be to provide more relief to Americans struggling against the weight of the health and economic impacts of COVID-19. Since last March, I’ve worked to secure five major bipartisan relief bills in Congress, including the CARES Act and the $900 billion measure that was signed into law in December. These packages have helped Marylanders weather the storm of COVID-19 by bolstering our public health infrastructure and extending a lifeline to working families and small businesses harmed by the economic fallout. 
And while I was glad that we’ve been able to take these steps to mitigate some impacts of the pandemic, now is not the time to pat ourselves on the back, say we’re done, and throw in the towel. These are unprecedented times, and we need to go big before it’s too late. We must ramp up vaccine production and distribution, expand testing and access to N95 masks, get help to those hardest hit, get our children safely back in school, and put our economy on the road to recovery. I was proud to speak on the Senate floor in favor of the budget resolution that will allow us to pass President Biden’s American Rescue Plan in the Senate with a simple majority and am now working urgently with colleagues to get this ambitious package across the finish line. 
The experts and the American people agree with me on this one. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen has said: “The smartest thing we can do is act big.” Even President Trump’s former top economist, Kevin Hassett, has supported that assessment. And the American people are on board with President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, which would accelerate the deployment of vaccines and testing; help get our students back into school as quickly and safely as possible; extend enhanced unemployment benefits beyond mid-March; double the amount of rental assistance available to those at risk of eviction; extend badly needed support to local governments on the front lines; provide another round of individual payments based on income eligibility; and, very importantly, expand the child tax credit in a way that would cut child poverty by more than 40% this year. All of these measures are necessary to beat the virus and prevent a double-dip economic recession.  
As we fight for relief on the federal front, I remain deeply troubled by the lack of statewide coordination and communication in Maryland's vaccine rollout. At the time of this writing, Maryland is ranked 49th among all 50 states for percent of total vaccines administered and 41st among all 50 states for vaccines administered per 100,000 people, according to CDC data. And while I'm glad more vaccines are coming in, our state needs a more transparent and efficient process to get vaccines to Marylanders in a more equitable way. I was glad to be joined by my colleagues in the Maryland congressional delegation earlier this month in a letter to Governor Hogan, which called for a course correction in Maryland's vaccine distribution approach. These calls have since been echoed by Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott and our county leaders. I will continue to push for accountability and action at the state level so we can get more shots into the arms of Marylanders as soon as possible. I'll also keep pushing for the federal relief measures necessary to bolster vaccine distribution in our communities, secure our supply chain, and strengthen vaccine confidence and communication. 
Fixing USPS
I’ve been hearing from hundreds of constituents about slow postal delivery, and I share their anger and frustration at this unacceptable situation. Medication shipments have gone missing, many small businesses cannot get their products to customers, and many are getting hit with late fees for bill payments that didn’t arrive on time because of mail delivery delays. The situation is doubly frustrating because the Congress allocated an additional $10 billion to the Postal Service to help meet its needs during the pandemic, and that money must be put to use restoring the service that the American people have come to expect from the dedicated men and women of the Postal Service. That’s why I led a letter with the Maryland congressional delegation demanding action from Postmaster General Louis DeJoy. In the letter, we urged DeJoy to halt any further downsizing measures and return to the 2012 service standards, which would reinstate overnight delivery and shorten delivery time. 
The Postal Service leadership needs to take responsibility for the harm done by their cutbacks, fix the issues that have plagued deliveries, and replace Louis DeJoy. Trump may have left office, but his Postmaster General is still wreaking havoc on mail delivery that Marylanders and all Americans rely on. It’s time for fresh leadership at USPS, and I will continue to push for reliable service, more accountability, and faster delivery times moving forward.
Our push to improve postal delivery is the result of what I have been hearing from the hundreds of constituents who reached out to my office voicing their concern. It’s just one example of how our state is strongest when we work together. I want to hear from you and hope you will continue to stay engaged.

2/21/21 17:02,Bacon Brief: Legislative Update Week of February 15,"￼
February 21, 2021
 
Week of February 15
 
Hello friends,
 
This coming Tuesday I will be hosting a tele-town hall for our district at 6:00 p.m. CT to provide an update on what I have been working on and hear from you about what issues are important to you and your family. To join, you can call 855-920-0558. Look forward to hearing from you!
 
COMMITTEE NEWS: I was named the Ranking Member of the House Agriculture Committee’s Subcommittee on Nutrition, Oversight, and Department Operations. The subcommittee addresses policies and statutes relating to nutrition, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and domestic commodity distribution and consumer initiatives, as well as department agency oversight and special investigations.
During this pandemic, more families are struggling to put food on the table as they suffer job losses and income reductions. I am looking forward to working on how we can best make nutrition and domestic food assistance programs more efficient and effective so families most in need will get the assistance these programs were intended to provide. This includes looking at ways we can improve program integrity and move people toward self-sufficiency by incentivizing work. You can read more about it here.
As a member of the House Ag Committee, I feel it is important to hear from ag producers and business leaders about how federal policy affects them. That is why I have traveled to western Nebraska several times to hear “straight from the horse’s mouth” what is important to the ag community. This past week, I met with members of the Nebraska Dry Bean Commission in Gering, NE; toured Pennington Seed in Sydney, NE; and met with ag producers including the Holzfaster family in Paxton, NE. 
I also serve on the House Armed Services Committee and visited the F.E.Warren Air Force base in Wyoming, where they oversee intercontinental ballistic missile wings. I am committed to working to modernize these aging systems.
Next week, we head back to DC, and I hope that Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats will at least hear some of the concerns Republicans have with the next COVID relief package. One concern: not all of the money has been spent on the previous packages, so why we are authorizing even more? Also, let’s target relief to those Americans who truly need it: those whose hours have been reduced or have lost their jobs. Speaker Pelosi took zero input from the House GOP in the writing of the newest COVID bill, refused GOP input during the amendment process, and made clear she intends to pass this on a party line vote. This $1.9 trillion so-called COVID relief bill contains lots of non-COVID policies that she has been unable to pass. It also takes us to nearly $6 trillion in spending on COVID relief alone, when our annual budget is normally $4.5 trillion. This is a totally partisan bill. 
 
We need to work together to address these issues and get America on the road to recovery, instead of worrying about whether or not a twice-impeached President should be allowed to be buried at Arlington Cemetery. That’s right, House Democrats introduced H.R. 484 in late January; the “No Glory For Hate Act” which would ""prohibit the use of Federal funds for the commemoration of certain former Presidents” who have been impeached twice.” Our country deserves better and deserves meaningful legislation that actually liberates and assists Americans as we climb out of this pandemic.
 
I look forward to hearing from you about these issues and others, this coming Tuesday at 6:00 p.m. CT. 
 
Sincerely,
￼
  
Don Bacon, Member of Congress

2/21/21 17:10,Getting Closer to More COVID Relief,"￼ 
Friends,   This week, I met with New Jerseyans facing extraordinary challenges as a result of this pandemic and we talked about how President Biden’s American Rescue Plan that I’m fighting for in the Senate will provide direct relief to our families, businesses, and communities - in addition to ramping up an aggressive national vaccination plan.   Here are three things I want you to know about this legislation: 
 

￼
ONE: Relief for Workers and Families
Beyond extending unemployment benefits, this legislation will send most Americans another $1,400 check on top of the $600 payment passed in December. For COVID-19 survivors like Shivanthi Crawford and Travis from East Orange, who are struggling to get by, this money will be a lifeline. The bill also includes real tax relief for low-income workers and their families by increasing the maximum Child Tax Credit from $2,000 to $3,000, with an additional $600 for kids under the age of six, and making the credit fully refundable. Around 27 million children, including nearly half of all Black and Latino children, live in households that currently don’t qualify for the full benefit. Expanding this tax relief and making it available to those who need it the most has the potential to lift half of the children in the U.S. out of poverty and will impact the lives of more than a half-a-million kids in New Jersey.
 
￼ 
TWO: Keeping our Restaurants Alive
New Jersey has always been a great place to get a bite to eat, and I want it to stay that way. Unfortunately, while initial aid helped millions of small businesses, most of the COVID relief programs for small businesses passed last year failed to cater to the urgent needs of our family-owned restaurants, bars, cafes and eateries that have been hit hard by this pandemic. That’s why I’ve been pushing for months for the RESTAURANTS Act – a bill to provide direct assistance to these vital and beloved neighborhood places. Fortunately, significant pieces of this bill have been incorporated into the American Rescue Plan. We want our restaurant industry to survive this pandemic and ultimately thrive once its over, and that is what this money will help do. Listen to Sal Beradi’s story, owner of SalTown Deli in Woodland Park, who’s been fighting to keep his business alive. 
 
￼
THREE: Saving Essential Workers
Soaring coronavirus response costs, plummeting tax revenues, and the Trump Administration’s hands-off approach to this pandemic wreaked havoc on the budgets of states and communities. This has thrown the jobs of millions of our teachers, firefighters, public health workers, law enforcement officers and other essential workers across the country into jeopardy – at a time we can least afford it. That’s why I fought to make sure the American Rescue Plan includes direct funding to our state, county and local governments, much like I proposed in the bipartisan SMART Act I introduced last year. At the end of the day, I’m hopeful we will be able to bolster New Jersey’s state government with a $6 billion infusion and a $3 billion boost to our counties and municipalities. Not only will this help keep thousands of essential New Jersey workers on the job, but our communities will also benefit from multibillion-dollar investments to protect our public transit systems and help schools reopen safely by improving ventilation, reducing class size and more. Watch me explain the American Rescue Plan in greater detail here.

2/21/21 17:33,Back to School,"￼ 

Dear Friends,  I hope everyone is hanging in there after that rough week of snow.
 
Around the country and in certain communities in Ohio, schools have yet to return to full-time in-person learning. The Biden administration continues to offer mixed messages about when it believes students can and should go back.
 
For my part, I trust the science, which is clear: students who want to return to in-person learning can do so safely.
 
If you've got a child who has been affected by ongoing school closures, my colleagues and I would like to hear from you. Please share your story HERE.
 
In your service,
Brad

2/21/21 18:25,Winter Storm Recovery Resources,"
 
 

February 21, 2021

Dear friends,

While temperatures are rising and many Texans may have had their power restored, I know we are just beginning a long road to recovery. Millions of Texans remain without water, homes and businesses are experiencing severe damage, and a number of Texans have been displaced from their homes.

There must be accountability for the multitude of failures that occurred over the last week, which is why I was glad to see Governor Abbott order an investigation into ERCOT. I will continue to seek accountability in the coming days, weeks and months to guarantee this never happens again, and will do everything I can in Congress to assure federal assistance gets into the hands of those who need it most. In the meantime, my top priority remains ensuring our communities have the resources they need as soon as possible. 

Below you will find an updated list of resources that may be helpful for you and your neighbors as we all begin the recovery process. If you have access to a working phone and need assistance accessing additional information, please do not hesitate to contact my office. We are here to help however we can.

Sincerely,
 

Congresswoman Beth Van Duyne (TX-24)
 

RESOURCES

All North Texans experiencing any type of storm damage should report their damages to the Texas Department of Emergency Management by clicking HERE.  

Water Assistance Information

Some areas in North Texas are still under boil water notice and many more have plumbing issues that have left them without power. There are water distribution sites around North Texas, giving out water as it is coming in to DFW. You can find a list of current distribution sites HERE.  

Help with Food Assistance

The USDA has approved SNAP recipient’s ability to apply for food replacement benefits for food that was lost or destroyed. Call 211 to apply. 

Small Business Administration Loans

If you have damage to your home or business that is not covered by insurance, you may qualify for low interest loans through the Small Business Administration. Go to https://disasterloanassistance.sba.gov/ela/s/ for more information and to apply online. 

File a damage claim with your insurance

Most North Texans with storm damage will have to first file a claim with their homeowners’ insurance. For questions about filing a claim with your homeowners’ insurance, call the Texas Department of Insurance at 800-252-3439.

If your home was damaged due to a broken water pipe, downed tree limbs, or other winter damage, contact your insurance company or agent to file a claim as soon as possible. These tips will help make the process go smoother:

	•	Make a list of damaged property. Take pictures or video of the damage. Don't throw anything away until your insurance company tells you to.
	•	Take steps to protect your home from further damage. Turn off the water and cover broken windows and holes in your roof if possible. Save all receipts. Your policy may cover these costs.
	•	Try to be there when the insurance company comes to inspect the damage. If you can’t stay in your home, leave a note with information on where you can be reached.
	•	Keep a list of everyone you talk to at your insurance company. Be ready to answer questions about the damage.
	•	Ask about living expenses. Most policies will cover some of the costs you have if you are unable to live in your home because of damage that is covered by your insurance. Keep your receipts for these costs.
	•	Ask about an advance payment if you need help quickly.
	•	If you need shelter or emergency food or water, contact the Red Cross at 800-733-2767.

Call your insurance agent or company as soon as possible to report property damage.

For company phone numbers, use THIS LINK or call the Texas Department of Insurance at 800-252-3439. 

Tips to Avoid Fraud

	•	Get more than one bid. That will help you decide which offers are too high or too good to be true.
	•	Check references and phone numbers. Call the Better Business Bureau (BBB) to see if a contractor has complaints.
	•	Don't pay up front and don’t make your final payment until the job is finished. In a disaster, contractors from outside your area can’t ask for payment before they start work.
	•	Avoid contractors who offer to waive your deductible or promise a rebate for it. That’s illegal under state law and your insurance company may ask for proof that you paid it.
	•	Never sign a contract with blank spaces.
	•	Report possible price gouging to the Office of the Attorney General. 

Individual Assistance from FEMA

Denton, Dallas and Tarrant Counties have all been approved for individual assistance. Read below for more information on how to apply for these benefits. 

	•	Internet or Smartphone Application: Disaster survivors may apply for IHP Assistance or check their application status on-line at www.disasterassistance.gov. Disaster survivors may also access FEMA via smartphone by downloading the application from www.fema.gov or through their mobile provider’s application store. 
	•	FEMA Toll-Free Helpline: Disaster survivors may call FEMA toll-free at 800-621-3362 (TTY: 800-462-7585) to register for assistance or check their application status. Those who use a relay service such as a videophone, InnoCaption or CapTel should update FEMA with their specific number assigned to that service. 

FEMA assists individuals and households through the coordination and delivery of Individual Assistance programs, including: 

	•	Individuals and Households Program: IHP Assistance provides financial assistance and direct services to eligible individuals and households who have uninsured or underinsured necessary expenses and serious needs.   IHP Assistance is not a substitute for insurance and cannot compensate for all losses caused by a disaster; it is intended to meet basic needs and supplement disaster recovery efforts. IHP Assistance is not considered income or a resource when determining eligibility for welfare, income assistance, or income tested benefit programs that the federal government funds, such as Social Security benefits or disability income.  IHP Assistance is also exempt from garnishment or seizure, but this exception does not apply to FEMA recovering assistance received in error or fraud. 
	•	Food and supplies (Mass Care and Emergency Assistance): Mass Care is composed of seven services known as activities: sheltering; feeding; distribution of emergency supplies; support for individuals with disabilities and others with access and functional needs; reunification services for adults and children; support for household pets, service, and assistance animals; and mass evacuee support.  
	•	Disaster Unemployment Assistance: DUA provides unemployment benefits and re-employment assistance services to eligible survivors affected by a Presidentially-declared major disaster. These services are under the responsibility of the U.S. Department of Labor and administered by the state, territorial, tribal, and local government emergency management officials of the affected area(s). DUA is only available to those eligible survivors who are not eligible for regular state unemployment insurance (UI). 
	•	Disaster Case Management: DCM is a time-limited process that promotes partnership between a case manager and a disaster survivor in order to assess and address a survivor’s verified disaster-caused unmet needs through a disaster recovery plan. This disaster recovery plan includes resources, decision-making priorities, providing guidance and tools to assist disaster survivors. 
	•	Disaster Legal Services: DLS provides legal aid to survivors affected by a Presidentially-declared major disaster through an agreement with the Young Lawyers Division (YLD) of the American Bar Association.  DLS is put into effect during Presidentially-declared disasters and is available to survivors who qualify as low-income. 

Disaster Distress Helpline

This storm has taken a mental toll on all Texans. If you or someone you love is struggling please call the Disaster Distress Helpline. 

	•	To assist people in the impacted area in coping with the stress of the winter storms, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration activated the Disaster Distress Helpline. This toll-free, multilingual, and confidential crisis support provides immediate 24/7, 365-days-a-year crisis counseling and support. Residents in affected areas may call or text 1-800-985-5990 to connect with a trained crisis counselor. Spanish speakers should press 2.

Dear Neighbor,  I feel like I have started every email this year with a note that it has been a challenging and difficult week.  For our district, that is certainly the case this week.  I am hopeful that we are now moving into the recovery period for this week’s winter storm, but for many it will be a long and difficult recovery.    Not long after I wrote last week, power to residents across the district began to go out in the middle of the night, including to my parents.  Like people across the district, I spent the morning trying to help them—one lost both power and water Monday—and checking in with my team and people across the district.  When the power went out at my house later in the day on Monday, I counted myself lucky to have had a little extra time to prepare—to fill up my bathtub, charge my phone, and change the batteries in my lights in my “hurricane bag.”  So began the week that none of us will forget – one that challenged us all, raised questions that demand answers, and reminded us of what community is all about.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, I bundled up in our frigid house, focused on helping in all the ways I could.  As did our team.  Six of the seven members of our Houston team lost power this week, and the one who didn’t lost water early in the week.  Now, many have burst pipes and major damage.  Still, our TX07 team kept working, and our D.C. team was answering phone calls, getting help and information out, and advocating for resources and assistance around the clock.  I was grateful to have the support of the Speaker of the House and the Chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, who quickly and helpfully amplified our calls for assistance and answers.  I am really grateful to our staff for their dedication to our district, this week and every week.  We are still in this crisis.  As the power has been restored to most, and the water restored to many, neighbors all around us are dealing with the cascading impacts of this disaster.  We have short- and long-term challenges in front of us – from getting drinking water to those who need it to fixing pipes and repairing homes to getting to the bottom of how this all happened.  I know we can and we will, but I also know it will continue to take a toll on our community.  I encourage everyone who can to do what you can to help – there is great need in all corners of the district.  Our community has come together to support each other once again.  I was glad to participate in water distributions in our district organized by Houston City Council Member Abbie Kamin and Harris County Precinct 3 Commissioner Tom Ramsey, and to see our neighbors spring into action to help.  I will continue to share information about water distributions and resources on my social media and website in the days ahead.  And, of course, I want to hear from you about ways I can help you.

I want to hear about your experience during the winter storm our community endured, and I hope you will use the link to tell me and our team: 
	•	What happened for you during the storm? 
	•	What concerns you most, looking ahead? 
	•	How can I help?
You can click above or share your story HERE. 
￼
Throughout the week, I have been in communication with FEMA and the Texas Division of Emergency Management (TDEM), and with our local leaders in Houston and Harris County to convey the needs and urgency of our community and to support their requests for assistance.  On Thursday, I wrote a letter calling on FEMA to approve Texas’ request for a major disaster declaration as soon as possible and got many of my Texas colleagues to join it.  I am glad to report that that the request has been approved for Harris County—making possible federal funding to help recover here and across the state.  FEMA is now taking applications for claims for home or property damage:
	•	Please note: If you have insurance, you must file an insurance claim first.  FEMA cannot and will not duplicate benefits that you have received from insurance.
	•	You can apply online at disasterassistance.gov, through the FEMA app, or by phone at 800-621-3362.
￼

￼
Our team has compiled a list of resources on my website that could be helpful as we look to recovering from this past week.  A couple of highlights here:
	•	Harris County Office of Emergency Management: Text FREEZE to 888777 to get the most up to date information, including updates on recovery resources, from the Harris County Office of Emergency Management.
	•	Bottled Water Distribution Sites: Click here for a continually updated list.
	•	Medical Equipment: If you use durable medical equipment, like oxygen machines, that go out because they lose power, please call my office at 202- 225-2571 and we will see if we can assist.
	•	Price Gouging: To report price gouging or other disaster scams, call 800-621-0508 or file a complaint online at https://www.harriscountycao.org/pricegouging and txoag.force.com/CPDOnlineForm.
	•	Insurance: For questions about filing a claim or for insurance company contact information, you may contact the Texas Department of Insurance hotline at 1-800-252-3439, or click here for additional resources.
Here are some additional tips:
	•	As individuals begin to assess damage and make repairs to area homes and businesses, contact 8-1-1 to have utility lines marked before you dig to keep everyone safe.
	•	Keep any receipts for damages and take lots of pictures before repairs!
	•	Unfortunately, after a disaster, there are those who will try take advantage of the situation through scams and price gouging.  Below are some tips to help avoid these bad actors:  
￼

￼
As we move forward, we must determine what happened, why it happened, and how we can make sure it never happens again.  I have called for several investigations to make sure we get these answers:
	•	On Tuesday, I joined members of our Texas congressional delegation in sending a letter demanding answers from ERCOT and the Public Utility Commission of Texas about what led to the power failures our state was experiencing and its plan was to make sure that power was restored immediately.
	•	Along with my colleague from Fort Worth and fellow member of the Energy and Commerce Committee Congressman Marc Veasey, I requested a federal investigation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) (letter here), calling on the agency to work with Congress on several matters.
	•	On Friday, I led a letter with Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Frank Pallone, Energy Subcommittee Chairman Bobby L. Rush, Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee Chair Diana DeGette, and Congressman Marc Veasey to Governor Abbott asking for answers on matters relating to this week’s winter weather crisis (link here) that has left our neighbors here and fellow Texans across the state in the dark without power, heat, food, water, and medicine for multiple successive days.  
￼
And the winter weather crisis has exacerbated the coronavirus crisis here.  As you know, the weather crisis has delayed vaccination appointments and closed facilities.  I am glad to report that those activities will resume this week.  After hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 vaccine deliveries and injections were delayed by the winter storm, Texas will get nearly 600,000 first doses of the COVID-19 vaccine for next week.  This could not come at a more critical time, as more than 500,000 Americans have now died from COVID-19.   I will return to Washington this week, where the House will be in session to vote on legislation to enact President Biden’s American Rescue Plan to combat the pandemic.  Of course, I will stay focused on our recovery from this storm, and will continue working with our leaders in Houston and Harris County in the days ahead whether I am in Washington or Houston.  I am proud to represent you, and I am here to help you.  As always, please do not hesitate to call on me and my team if there is anything we can do to help you or if there is anything you want me to know.  You can email here or call (713) 353-8680 or (202) 225-2571 at any time.
Best wishes,

￼

Weekly Wrap-up with 
Congressman Byron Donalds
                                    February 22, 2021
 
 
Last week, I continued to meet with dedicated local business owners and the hardworking men and women who proudly call Florida's 19th Congressional District home.
 
As Floridians, Americans, and the globe continue to fight the COVID-19 Pandemic, Florida is continuing to stand out as a leader in navigating through the uncharted waters brought on by the virus. We continue to mourn every loss of life throughout our district and the world. I continue to applaud state and local leaders for their steadfast leadership in battling the pandemic, which has allowed Floridians to continue living their lives while also prioritizing all our residents' health and safety. 
 
This week, I will return to Washington, where I will continue working to ensure your government is working for you. As a member of the House Budget Committee, I will be taking part in the markup of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. While this bill sounds good, the reality is that many of the bill's proposals do not meet the needs of you and your family. Unfortunately, this bill throws 1.9 trillion dollars at a problem that trillions of American taxpayer dollars should not be funding. I came to Washington to treat your hard-earned money as if it were my own, and I will never support legislative action that irresponsibly mishandles your tax dollars.
 
Continue reading below for an update on legislative updates from Florida's 19th Congressional District! 
 

 
 
Celebrating Rush Limbaugh

A Beacon of Freedom: Honoring the Life & Legacy of Veronica Shoemaker
 
In honor of Black History Month, and my office's commitment to honoring Black Americans who shaped America, I penned an Op-Ed celebrating the life and legacy of the iconic Fort Myers City Councilwoman Veronica Shoemaker. Read the Op-Ed in its entirety below:
 
""Born on a dirt road in 1928, Veronica Shoemaker would live a life of struggle but, more importantly, perseverance. Growing up in South Florida, Veronica and her ten siblings would experience poverty, racism, and segregation. Veronica was the daughter of a preacher, and it was through her father's sermons, she learned the value of her voice. 
 
As a teenager enrolled in Dunbar High School, Veronica organized PTA meetings at night to give a voice to African-American students and parents. When African-Americans had little control over their education, she understood the significance of educational freedom and empowering parents.
 
Quickly becoming a pillar of racial equality in the Southwest Florida community, in 1954, Veronica was at the forefront of desegregating Lee County Schools. 
 
As a black man raising three sons in Southwest Florida, I am grateful and indebted to the life and legacy of Veronica Shoemaker for changing the trajectory of their lives. Leading the fight for racial equality, voting rights, and equal access to education, Veronica Shoemaker's persistence for civil rights for the African-American community has made her a beacon of freedom. For 17 years, she spoke truth to power and demanded that those on the City Council pay attention to the injustices facing her community. 
 
In 1982, Veronica Shoemaker was elected to the Fort Myers City Council, making her the first African-American to join the council. She was also the first African-American elected official in Lee County. Her victory was proof of a nation progressing and healing the racial divide she and many like her experienced firsthand. 
 
Being the first to do something comes with great gratification, but it also comes with tremendous pressure and, at times, burdens when walking upstream against the sea of inequity. As the first Black man to represent her hometown in Congress, I feel a tremendous amount of pride and admiration for her sacrifice and the sacrifice of countless other patriots who paved the way for Americans like me. While I never had the honor of meeting Mrs. Shoemaker, her life played an integral role for Black Americans who aspire to seek elected office.  
 
By refusing to accept her standing in society as an African-American woman, she defied generations of racism and, as a result, changed the destiny of countless Black Americans in Southwest Florida.  
 
Through decades of trials and tribulations, Veronica Shoemaker was able to cement her legacy on not only our local history but also America's history. Today and every day, we pay homage to the selfless and courageous Americans, like Veronica, for devoting their lives to ensuring prosperity in their beloved communities as well as upholding the promise of America that all men are created equal.""

Dear Friend,
As we continue to observe Black History Month this February, I would like to invite you to join a virtual conversation with Black leaders in Central Florida TODAY, Monday, Feb. 22 at 7 p.m. This event seeks to elevate local Black voices and listen to the issues facing the Black community in our area. In the course of this discussion, we’ll aim to dissect some of the most urgent issues affecting the Black community, from the COVID-19 pandemic, to social justice, to jobs and housing, and more.
I will facilitate the panel on Facebook Live, which will include the following speakers:
	•	Dr. Karenna Senors, Chief Medical Officer of True Health
	•	Pastor Octavius Smith, Senior Pastor of Allen Chapel A.M.E. Church
	•	Emory Green, Lead Volunteer of Midway Coalition, Inc.
	•	Dr. Barbara Jenkins, Superintendent of Orange County Public Schools
I know that our community continues to feel the impact of this pandemic in different ways, which is why I am hosting this panel to discuss disparities within communities of color, and the best way we can move forward together. I encourage all those in Florida’s Seventh Congressional District, which includes all of Seminole County and most of northern Orange County, to join us. This panel will be held on Facebook Live today at 7:00 p.m. Follow my page on Facebook to get an invitation and reminders about the event.
I look forward to listening to these Central Florida leaders and having these important conversations to help us better understand what we can all do to help everyone in our community.

2/22/21 9:41,"Wicker Urges Immigration Enforcement, Border Security","￼
Wicker Urges Immigration Enforcement, Border Security 
In recent days, President Biden put forward a sweeping and misguided plan to overhaul our nation’s immigration system. Most notably, the proposal fails to address the long-term security challenges that have plagued our southern border. This legislation comes as a new migrant caravan is now making its way through Mexico, threatening another surge on our border. Without a serious commitment to border security, President Biden’s proposal will likely encourage more waves of illegal immigration by rewarding those who violate U.S. law. 
Biden Plan Encourages Caravans 
For several weeks, the Biden Administration has been signaling that the days of strict immigration enforcement are over. A few days before taking office, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris appeared on Univision to outline the Biden Administration’s lax immigration policies. Days later, a caravan of over 7,000 migrants formed in Honduras and began heading north toward the U.S., leading Mexico’s President to warn that migrants believe the “doors are open.” Upon taking office, President Biden immediately rescinded President Trump’s order that had strengthened federal-state cooperation on immigration enforcement. He also withdrew funding for barrier projects on our southern border and ordered a 100-day pause on deportations – a move that has since been blocked in court. 
President Biden is now pushing legislation that is weaker on border security than even the policies backed by President Obama, with whom he served as Vice President. Biden’s proposal would grant immediate legal status to farmworkers, those with temporary protected status, and recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. It would also give pathways to citizenship to almost all illegal immigrants and expand our refugee resettlement program. There is one helpful provision that would boost surveillance technology along the border, but the bill would not provide funds for border wall construction, which is critical to any balanced approach to immigration reform. 
Immigration Reform Must Include a Secure Border, More Agents, and Surveillance 
Of the more than 11 million people living illegally in the U.S. today, many were brought here by their parents at a young age. There has long been a bipartisan willingness to address these children while also strengthening immigration enforcement across the board. Although President Obama imposed DACA by executive decree, he also deported three million illegal residents, oversaw the construction of over 125 miles of border wall, and supported legislation that would have funded new barriers. By contrast, President Biden appears to be the first President to take the position that barriers are not part of comprehensive border security. 
As a member of the House and Senate, I have voted for the construction of walls and fencing along our southern border during every administration since President Bill Clinton. I have also supported boosting the number of border patrol agents and expanding the use of surveillance technology. These security measures are essential to any reasonable and balanced approach to immigration reform. 
Earlier this month, the Senate held a series of important immigration votes. I voted in favor of protecting contracts with companies that are building fences on our southern border. I also voted for the Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act, which would withhold critical funding from sanctuary cities that disregard our immigration laws. In addition, I voted for a measure that would prioritize the arrest of criminal aliens who have committed violent crimes. Regrettably, Democrats rejected these measures, resulting in a failure to pass what should be mainstream priorities. 
It appears unlikely that President Biden will come to recognize the pressing need for these reforms, but Republicans will continue to make the case for border walls, surveillance, and more agents as essential to any realistic immigration package.

February 22, 2021 
WEBSITE | SHARE ON:  ￼  ￼ 

Dear Friend, 
 
Last week, millions of Texans faced extreme winter weathers and days without power or running water. However, we also saw incredible kindness to our fellow neighbors, including taking in strangers without power and delivering food and supplies to those in need.  I am working hard to make sure our local governments, non-profits, and residents have the resources to help with recovery efforts.
 
Our community is strong, and we will rebuild together.
 
President Biden partially approved Texas’ request for a Major Disaster Declaration. This important first step will allow the federal government to deliver more funding and resources to the region. 
 
As we begin to rebuild, I want to make sure you have information to help navigate your families’ recovery efforts. Please review the details below and, as always, reach out to my office if you need assistance. 
 
FEMA Assistance
Texas homeowners and renters in 77 counties designated for individual assistance who sustained damage may now apply for disaster assistance with FEMA. You can register for FEMA Assistance by visiting  http://disasterassistance.gov or calling  800-621-3362 (TTY: 800-462-7585). The toll-free telephone lines operate from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. CDT, seven days a week. 
 
When you apply for assistance, have the following information readily available:
	•	A current phone number where you can be contacted
	•	Your address at the time of the disaster and the address where you are now staying
	•	Your Social Security number, if available
	•	A general list of damage and losses
	•	If insured, the insurance policy number, or the agent and company name
 
If you are in one of the 177 counties not currently declared a disaster, please report your damages to http://TDEM.Texas.gov/warm. TDEM is providing damage totals to FEMA to determine if assistance is required for additional counties.
 
If it is safe to do so, start cleaning up now to prevent further damage. Make sure to take photos to document damages and keep receipts from all purchases related to the cleanup and repair.
 
Disaster assistance may include financial assistance for temporary lodging and home repairs, low-interest loans to cover uninsured property losses, and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster.
 
FEMA does not reimburse for food lost due to a power failure. Voluntary organizations in your communities may be able to assist. Residents are encouraged to call 211 for assistance.
 
Texas Department of Insurance
If your home was damaged due to a broken water pipe, downed tree limbs, or other winter damage, contact your insurance company or agent to file a claim as soon as possible. Following these tips will help make the process go smoother:
	•	Keep a record of everyone you spoke with at the insurance company
	•	Ask about an advance payment if you need support quickly
	•	Inquire about living expenses. Some policies will cover some of the costs if you are unable to live in your home because of covered damage 
	•	Make sure you keep receipts for any costs you pay out-of-pocket 
TDI can provide contact information for your insurance company or help with questions about how to file a claim. Call the Help Line from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Central time, Monday to Friday: 800-252-3439.

 Congresswoman Beatty Helps Introduce Equality Act Cosponsors historic LGBTQ rights bill
U.S. Congressman Joyce Beatty (OH-03) joined congressional leadership in the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate to introduce the Equality Act, H.R. 5, comprehensive civil rights legislation that prohibits discrimination against members of the LGBTQ community in employment, education, credit, jury service, federal funding, housing, and public accommodations.
“It is truly unfathomable that a person can get married on a Sunday and fired on Monday—or even lose their home—because of the person they love,” Beatty said. “I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Equality Act and call on my colleagues to support this critical piece of legislation so that all Americans are treated equally under the law.” She continued, “Not just in the workplace, but in every place.” 
Despite progress made at the federal level in recent years, many forms of discrimination against LGBTQ Americans persist. Millions of LGBTQ people can get married on Sunday, post their wedding photos to Facebook on Monday, and then get thrown out of their apartment on Tuesday for no reason other than the fact that they are LGBTQ. In fact, in 27 states, a person can be denied housing because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. LGBTQ people can also be denied access to education in 31 states, and the right to serve on a jury in 41 states. The Equality Act fixes these problems by amending existing federal civil rights laws to explicitly prohibit discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity in employment, education, housing, credit, jury service, public accommodations, and federal funding.
H.R. 5 is endorsed by leading advocacy organizations, including the Human Rights Campaign, the NAACP, the Urban League, the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Women’s Law Center, the National Center for Transgender Equality, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the National Black Justice Coalition, the National Center for Lesbian Rights, the National LGBTQ taskforce, Lambda Legal, Family Equality Council, the National Partnership for Women and Families, the Transgender Law Center, Freedom for all Americans, SAGE, PFLAG, and the Center for American Progress.
Of note, the Equality Act was passed by the House in 2019 on a bipartisan 236-173 vote. Unfortunately, then-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) refused to bring the bill to the floor for a vote. However, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (MD-05) indicated the House will again consider the Equality Act this week.

2/22/21 15:01,Mario's Message,"
 
 

February 22, 2021
Dear friend,

Welcome back to another edition of Mario’s Message. As the 117th Congress kicks off, I want to continue to ensure that my constituents are kept up to date on all things happening in Washington and Florida’s 25th Congressional District. It is my absolute honor to serve you, and I encourage you to get in touch with my office if we can ever be of assistance. 
 

COVID-19 Vaccine Information 

Governor Ron DeSantis has signed Executive Order 20-315, which outlines that providers can only administer the COVID-19 shot to the following groups: 
	1.	Long-term care facility residents and staff
	2.	Healthcare workers in direct contact with COVID-19 patients, including paramedics and EMS
	3.	People age 65 and older

Additional COVID-19 vaccination sites have opened in FL-25! 

To view vaccination sites near you or schedule an appointment, please visit the links below: 
	•	Walmart
	•	Publix
	•	Winn-Dixie

Visit my website for additional details and a comprehensive list of COVID-19 vaccine distribution sites in our community. 
COVID-19 Resources

As of February 21, 2021, there have been 4,082,872 COVID-19 vaccine doses administered in Florida with a total of 2,693,953 people vaccinated. 
 
 

New Airport Security Technology
 

 
 

Last week, I visited Miami International Airport to check out the newest Credential Authentication Technology (CAT) being implemented by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to improve airport security, make the screening process more touchless, and enhance the overall passenger experience. CAT is now available and in-use at Miami International Airport and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. 
 

We Must Maintain U.S.-Cuba Policy & Remain in Solidarity with the Cuban People
 

It was an honor to join the Inspire America Foundation, a bipartisan group of colleagues, and members of Cuba’s opposition in an event calling on the current Administration to maintain U.S.-Cuba policy. Over the past four years, our country made tremendous progress in cutting off revenue to the brutal, anti-American dictatorship in Cuba. Now, it’s crucial that we prevent the current administration from squandering this opportunity to remain in solidarity with the Cuban people and support them in their struggle for democracy.
 

Meeting with Miami-Dade Mayor
 

It was great to meet with Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava to discuss shared priorities for the coming months to support our Miami-Dade constituents and advance local projects. I look forward to our collaboration.

￼
Worryingly, some of my Democratic colleagues have recently shown support for packing our Supreme Court for political reasons by adding additional justices.
The Supreme Court has had nine justices since Congress set that standard in 1869. If Democrats were to pack the Supreme Court today, they would not only change over 152 years of precedent - they would undermine our system of checks and balances and erode Americans' faith in our judiciary.
The independence of our nation's highest court cannot be jeopardized. That is why I have joined a resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution limiting the Supreme Court to nine justices.
This amendment will help protect the integrity of the Supreme Court for generations to come.

2/22/21 16:19,UPDATE: Efforts to Speed up COVID Vaccine Distribution,"￼ 

  
Friend –  
Getting COVID-19 vaccines into the arms of Michiganders and Americans is an essential part of getting through this public health and economic crisis. 
I’m pushing to pass critical, additional resources to aid those efforts and working closely with President Joe Biden to ensure every Michigander can be vaccinated. I was proud to join President Biden on Friday at the Pfizer facility in Portage, where Michiganders have developed, manufactured and distributed a safe, effective vaccine quickly. 
￼ 
While we celebrate their remarkable work, I know that many people are also frustrated and angry at the difficulties they have experienced trying to secure vaccines for themselves or their loved ones. 
I am encouraged that the Biden Administration is taking significant action to increase the availability of vaccines. The previous Administration failed to develop a comprehensive, effective plan to distribute vaccines, increase vaccine supply or leverage the federal government to ensure states could quickly get vaccines into people’s arms. Recently the Biden Administration announced they had secured an additional 200 million vaccine doses – enough to inoculate every American adult by the end of the summer. I’m also encouraged they are marshaling federal resources to stand up community vaccination sites, and it is vital that vaccines are distributed equitably as well – so that no community is left behind. 
In the Senate, I am working with my colleagues to pass the President’s American Rescue Plan, which would provide robust relief to address this pandemic. It includes significant emergency support for struggling families and small businesses, to safely reopen school and to speed up vaccine distribution. The package has critical funding to educate the public as part of a national vaccination plan. It also would give FEMA needed resources that are vital to helping our state and local governments deploy COVID-19 vaccines. 
This package has bipartisan support in Michigan and across the country, and is supported by mayors, governors and economic experts from across the political spectrum. I am hopeful we can pass and enact this urgently needed legislation soon. 
As Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I will continue working to make sure the federal government is doing everything in its power to ensure that vaccines are free and widely available to every community as quickly and efficiently as possible. 
Thanks for reading, 
￼

United States Senator for Michigan

National Review
By: Alexandra DeSanctis, 2/05/2021
 
In a letter this morning to Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), 48 Republican senators have pledged to oppose any spending bill that does not contain the Hyde amendment or other pro-life protections.
Since 1976, Hyde has been added on a bipartisan basis to federal spending bills to prevent taxpayer money from directly reimbursing abortion providers for the cost of elective abortions.
Today’s letter — a copy of which was provided exclusively to National Review — was spearheaded by Montana senator Steve Daines, who founded and chairs the Senate Pro-Life Caucus, and its signatories include every GOP senator aside from Susan Collins (R., Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R., Alaska).
“Abortion is not health care; rather, it is a brutal procedure that destroys the life of an innocent unborn child,” the letter states. “The Hyde Amendment reflects a consensus that millions of pro-life Americans who are profoundly opposed to abortion should not be coerced into paying for it or incentivizing it with their taxpayer dollars.”
It goes on to cite a recent survey showing that most Americans, including a third of Democrats and those who call themselves pro-choice, oppose taxpayer funding of abortion.
The letter follows a similar one from House Republicans to congressional leadership, spearheaded by the Republican Study Committee and its chairman, Indiana representative Jim Banks. In that letter, 200 House Republicans pledged to vote against any legislation that fails to include Hyde.
“We have a message for Democratic leader Schumer: We will vote to block any radical, pro-abortion agenda,” Daines said in a statement today to National Review. “That includes any bill that undermines the Hyde amendment and other longstanding pro-life protections.”
Because the letter received the signatures of 48 Republicans in the Senate, pro-life lawmakers have the votes to filibuster any legislation that isn’t considered under reconciliation.
Until 2016, politicians in both parties supported Hyde as a conscience protection for pro-lifers. But in 2016, the Democratic Party platform explicitly demanded taxpayer funding of abortion, and nearly every politician competing for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination promised to oppose Hyde.
No president has ever vetoed a spending bill over its inclusion of Hyde, and Barack Obama included the provision in his proposed budgets during his presidency.
During his long political career, Joe Biden supported Hyde, calling it an important protection for pro-life Americans, and he reaffirmed that position as recently as 2019. But while running for president, Biden reversed himself and promised to back Democratic efforts to fund abortion.
“There’s nothing unifying about using taxpayer money to fund abortions,” Senator Ben Sasse (R., Neb.) told National Review. “Nancy Pelosi and other abortion zealots are trying to wage a culture war so they can get some of Planned Parenthood’s sweet campaign cash. That’s wrong.”
“Democrats are determined to use their razor-thin majorities in Congress to destroy pro-life protections like the Hyde Amendment,” Arkansas senator Tom Cotton said. “Republicans are committed to stopping their scheme so federal dollars are never used to harm unborn babies.”
“A clear majority of Americans support the Hyde amendment,” Sasse added. “Joe Biden pretty much summed it up when he said that ‘those of us who are opposed to abortions should not be compelled to pay for them.’”
All 48 senators who signed today’s letter have pledged “to vote against the advancement of any legislation that would eliminate or weaken the Hyde Amendment or any other current-law pro-life protections, or otherwise undermine existing Federal pro-life policy.”

2/22/21 17:25,Newsletter: Gimenez Urges Bold Stance on China,"
 

Dear Friends,
 
This week in Miami, I had the opportunity to stand with various pro-democracy advocacy groups and make clear the need to maximize political pressure on the communist regime in Cuba. Elected officials in this community have differences, but if something unites us, it is asking for the freedom of Cuba. Working towards a freer, more democratic Cuba has always been a bipartisan consensus and we must ensure it remains that way. 
 

I also had the opportunity to visit the new Peter Pan exhibit at the American Museum of the Cuban Diaspora. This exhibit honors the legacy and the history of the thousands of unaccompanied minors who were exiled from Cuba and made their way to the United States in search of freedom. 
 

Having immigrated to the United States with my family during the first years of the Cuban Revolution, I know firsthand the importance of a society that honors those traditions of individual liberty. We understand the result of socialism, communism, and authoritarianism. That is why we must always stand up to protect those values.

Sincerely,
Carlos A. Gimenez
Member of Congress
 

Gimenez Leads Opposition to Guantanamo Bay Closure

Congressman Carlos A. Gimenez led an opposition to President Biden’s plan to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facilities and demanded a commitment from the White House that current detainees would not be transferred to South Florida. 
 

In the letter, the members write that Guantanamo Bay is critical to keeping known terrorists from continuing their plot of attacks against the United States and allies around the world. The letter in part states:
 
“The facilities at GTMO were opened following the attacks of September 11, 2001 and are used to house some of the most notorious terrorists who have committed, or conspired to commit, grave harm to the United States, including the 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. The detention facility is vital to keeping our enemies off the battlefield and off our shores.”

Should the Biden administration continue to pursue closure of the detention facility, the members urge President Biden to continue the policy that would prevent the transfer of detainees into the mainland United States, saying:

“[W]e urge you to continue the congressionally approved longstanding policy that bars the federal government from transferring detainees at Guantanamo Bay to the U.S. mainland. As a country, we must ensure these ruthless terrorists never set foot on American soil, and in South Florida in particular.”
 
The letter, which was sent to the White House last Thursday, was also signed by Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart and Congresswoman Maria Elvira Salazar.

Gimenez Visits Customs and Border Protection at Miami International Airport
 

On Thursday, Congressman Carlos A. Gimenez, who serves on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the House Homeland Security Committee, visited U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials based at Miami International Airport to discuss ways federal agents are keeping America’s ports of entry safe. He was joined by House Homeland Security Committee colleague and fellow Floridian Congresswoman Kat Cammack.
 

Miami International Airport, which is the 3rd largest entry point into the United States, services over 20 million international passengers and 61 international destinations. It is also one of the largest destinations of international commerce entering the United States. These demands mean CBP officials must be on the lookout for potential criminals entering the country, illicit drugs, prohibited agricultural products, and other contraband. 

Gimenez Denounces White House's Proposed Florida Travel Ban

Last week, Congressman Carlos A. Gimenez denounced the Biden Administration’s proposed travel ban to Florida. Joining 7 other Florida delegation members, the letter sent to President Biden lays out the negative economic impact on the Sunshine State should a travel ban be implemented. 
 

In releasing the letter, Gimenez highlighted the proactive steps Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has taken to keep Florida’s economy moving forward amid the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in thousands of businesses closing down and millions of Americans losing their jobs.
 
“Governor Ron DeSantis has done an exceptional job in keeping our communities safe while doing everything in his power to keep Florida’s economy moving forward. Florida was among the first states to vaccinate frontline workers, to implement a program to vaccinate seniors 65+, and get long-term care facilities the resources they need throughout the pandemic.
 
Florida ranks 28th in COVID-19 cases per-capita, 30th in hospitalizations per-capita, 42nd in fatalities per-capita, and overall, Florida is trending downwards. This proposal is not one rooted in science. Instead, it is a political attempt to tarnish Governor DeSantis,” Gimenez said. 

Gimenez Office Hosted Food Drive with Local Partners
 

The office of Congressman Carlos A. Gimenez hosted a food drive event last Friday, February 19th, 2021 at Larry and Penny Thompson Memorial Park in Miami. At the event, 800 hot meals were served to families who faced difficulties during the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 

Gimenez’s office partnered with State Senator Ana Maria Rodriguez, District 9 Commissioner Kionne McGhee, the Miami-Dade Parks Department, the Miami-Dade Police Department and Farm Share to bring this food drive to the community. 
 
Farm Share was established in 1991 as a means to eliminate food waste. Farm Share’s mission remains focused on re-packing fresh, nutritious fruits and vegetables that would otherwise be thrown away. 

Gimenez Urges Bold Stance on China 
 

Congressman Carlos Gimenez urged President Biden in an op-ed in The Hill ­this week to maintain a strong and deliberate stance on China. He wrote that his personal experience in witnessing Chinese state-owned enterprises bidding for contacts in American infrastructure highlights China’s use of non-military tactics to undermine American influence domestically and around the world. 
 
Detailing experiences he had when serving as Mayor of Miami-Dade County, Gimenez wrote:
 
“CRRC, a state-owned Chinese rolling stock manufacturer, is one of many Chinese state-owned companies that have tried to insert themselves into America’s infrastructure, attempting to bid on contracts to become an important part of Miami-Dade County’s light rail systems. Chinese state-owned companies manufacture several freight cranes in the Port of Miami, making us vulnerable to a potential situation where China would have the ability to access information on the products being imported, the state of our infrastructure, and in effect give them the ability to control access to our port.”
 
Over the past decade, China has used its own economic prowess to undermine global institutions currently dominated by the United States and its partners and allies. Through the Chinese Communist Party’s ambitious “Belt and Road Initiative,” China has vastly expanded its economic linkages to some of the world’s most impoverished nations, creating an ecosystem of dependency and reliance on China for meeting basic economic needs. The Trump Administration identified China’s actions as economic aggression, a policy that Secretary of State Antony Blinken has committed to preserving under the Biden Administration.
 
“If the Biden administration can commit to maintaining a great powers competition strategy, then I will be the first stand beside President Biden to defend our nation from China’s threats of global dominance,” Gimenez wrote.

2/22/21 17:52,Weekly Newsletter from the Office of Congressman Blake Moore,"

February 22, 2021
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dear Fellow Utahn,

I hope this finds you well and staying safe in these winter storms. It was another great week in northern Utah! A major highlight was my all-day trip to Hill Air Force Base. The visit provided me with a broad overview of Hill AFB’s impressive daily operations and the chance to meet those who lead Team Hill, including Brig. Gen. von Hoffman, Col. Jenise Carroll, and Lt. Col. Stephen Redmond. It was an amazing day that left me even more proud to represent Hill AFB on the House Armed Services Committee.  
 
 
 
 

﻿I also met with Greg Manuel of Northrop Grumman in Roy to learn about the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent system. This missile system is slated to replace all 450 Minuteman III for the first time in over 50 years. They are doing great work to modernize our nuclear triad and national defense.


Another highlight of the week was participating in a forum with the University of Utah’s Hinckley Institute of Politics moderated by Director Jason Perry. I had a great time talking to students about my first weeks in Congress and answering questions about federal spending, my legislative priorities, and bipartisan cooperation. I love interacting with politically engaged students, and I encourage all young people to continue learning about government and policy.  
 
 
 
 


﻿
This weekend, I spoke at Honor 365’s 9/11 Honor Walk in Layton. I was grateful to be part of such an impactful event as we recognized those who have served and continue to serve their country and communities. Together we paid our respects to fallen local heroes, including Officer Nate Lyday and Major Brent Taylor. We swore after 9/11 that we would never forget, and organizations like Honor 365 are upholding that commitment. 

We saw great news come out of Utah this week with the announcement that Utahns over the age of 65 are now eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine. For regularly updated information on COVID-19, go to www.coronavirus.utah.gov. 

Back in D.C., the House Natural Resources Committee announced its subcommittee assignments, and I am thrilled to serve on the National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands Subcommittee and as Vice Ranking Member of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee. I look forward to representing the First District’s interests on these subcommittees as we work to hold federal agencies accountable for more effective land management.  

Please reach out to my office if you would like to schedule a meeting or need help navigating a federal agency. It is an honor to serve you, and I look forward to updating you next week!

Serving You in 2021
Dear Friend,

Serving the good folks of the Third District of Georgia is my number one priority, and I want you to know that I am listening. In 2021, I will be working to expand broadband in rural areas, help small businesses recover from the pandemic, create jobs in our communities, keep taxes low, increase opportunities for families and students, increase access to quality healthcare, address mental health issues, and more.
2020 was challenging for so many, but we as Americans are resilient. In 2021, I will continue to work tirelessly for you in Congress and am even more invigorated to help lead us forward down the road to recovery. By working with my colleagues in Congress, federal agencies, and localities to ensure that your voices and priorities are heard, I am committed to getting real results for the people of the Third District.  Click here to read more about my priorities this Congress.

Committee Action
Last Thursday, the Ways and Means Committee held an Oversight Subcommittee hearing on free tax preparation services for timely returns. Since many rural communities don’t have the same resources as those in urban areas, we must ensure that accurate information and assistance are available - even in less populated areas. Since everyone is entitled to a timely tax return, we must find the best targeted approach to ensure the process runs smoothly. Click here to watch my full remarks.

RIP Rush Limbaugh
On Wednesday, I was deeply saddened to learn of the passing of Rush Limbaugh, a conservative icon and giant of the radio industry. For decades, Rush spoke directly to millions of Americans every day and revolutionized the way folks consumed the news. Without question, his voice will sorely be missed. My thoughts and prayers are with his family, loved ones, and fans as we mourn this devastating loss.
Learn more about Rush’s legacy here.

Vaccine Registration
Last week, Governor Brian Kemp announced the rollout of a new website where Georgians can pre-register for the COVID-19 vaccine. Folks that are not currently in the priority groups can still visit the webpage and pre-register for the vaccine on a voluntary basis. If you feel the vaccine is the right choice for you and your family, you can register through the website here.


The Week Ahead

This week, I will visit with members of the Georgia National Guard who are stationed in Washington, D.C. 
The House will also consider the following pieces of legislation:
H.R. 264 - To designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1101 Charlotte Street in Georgetown, South Carolina, as the ""Joseph Hayne Rainey Memorial Post Office Building”  H.R. 813 - To designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 1050 Sunset Road Southwest in Albuquerque, New Mexico, as the “Jose Hernandez Post Office Building”  H.R. 772 - To designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 229 Minnetonka Avenue South in Wayzata, Minnesota, as the ""Jim Ramstad Post Office”  H.R. 208 - To designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 500 West Main Street, Suite 102 in Tupelo, Mississippi, as the ""Colonel Carlyle 'Smitty' Harris Post Office” H.R. 546 - Effective Assistance of Counsel in the Digital Era Act H.R.         - PRRADA, the Puerto Rico Recovery Accuracy in Disclosures Act  H.R. 5 - Equality Act (Subject to a Rule)) H.R. 803 - Protecting America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act (Subject to a Rule)  Consideration of the American Rescue Plan
As always, I’m here to serve you. Please contact my office with any questions, comments, or concerns. Be sure to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to keep track of upcoming legislation and events!

Drew Ferguson plans to run for re-election. What are his priorities in Congress? Ledger-Enquirer – 2/21 U.S. Rep. Drew FERGUSON (R-West Point) told the Ledger-Enquirer Friday that he plans to run for re-election to Congress in 2022. FERGUSON, who has served Georgia’s 3rd Congressional District since 2017, revealed his plans during a 20-minute interview that covered his legislative priorities for the new session, the $1.9 trillion COVID relief package touted by President Joe Biden and what lessons the GOP learned in 2020 that they can use in Georgia’s next statewide elections.

Legislative Work



Dear Friend,    Welcome back to my Week in Review newsletter. You can sign up for my weekly updates and other issue-specific newsletters here. Please remember to follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube for regular updates on how I am serving my constituents!     Last week, I had the pleasure of spending my state work period back home in South Carolina. Throughout the week, I met with restaurant owners and employees to discuss current issues facing them, like the potential impact of an artificial minimum wage hike, which folks across the state have told me would destroy their small businesses and force them to lay off hardworking South Carolinians. I also had the chance to go to Meeting Street Academy to hear from students and parents about the challenges Covid has presented to educational opportunities, their goals, and the importance of education. These conversations with my fellow South Carolinians will continue to guide my decisions in Washington as I work on behalf of our great state.   Backing our Nation’s Entrepreneurs   As co-chair of the Senate Entrepreneurship Caucus, I am always looking for ways to help entrepreneurs and start-up businesses reach their full potential. In pursuit of that goal, my co-chair Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and I took action to support our small businesses, which have taken the brunt of the economic downturn.   We filed a Senate resolution declaring last week National Entrepreneurship Week, and we reintroduced the bipartisan Enhancing Entrepreneurship for the 21st Century Act, which will authorize a comprehensive study on what factors have caused a decrease in startup businesses across the country over the past several years. Our entrepreneurs and small businesses are the backbone of the American economy, and it’s my goal to ensure they have adequate resources to make their American Dream a reality.   Prioritizing Students and Holding Biden Nominees Accountable   After 11 months away from the classroom, our children desperately need a return to socialization & in-person education. Suicides, depression, and learning loss are increasing every minute our schools remain closed. I joined FOX News this week to explain why we simply can’t wait any longer to bring our kids back to the classroom.    Not only is it crucial our children are back in schools, but it is also imperative they have access to the right schools for them. So many Washington elites have benefitted from the luxury of attending private schools when their families decided their assigned schools were not the best fit. The least we can do is level the playing field so kids across the nation – from rural America to our inner cities – have that same opportunity.   Unfortunately, instead of putting children’s needs first, President Biden’s administration has prioritized teachers unions and rejected commonsense reforms like school choice. That is why, last Thursday, I announced my decision to vote against Miguel Cardona, the president’s nominee for secretary of education. To read more in depth about this decision, check out my opinion piece in the Post and Courier. I will always champion greater opportunities for our nation’s children.   Sincerely, 
￼

2/22/21 19:50,The East Chicago Lead Issue Must Never Happen Again,"A message from US Senator Todd Young
￼ 


Black History Month
Last week, I released a video in recognition of the history and heritage of Indiana’s Black Communities in honor of Black History Month. Click here or on the video below to hear my full remarks.  
￼ 
The East Chicago Lead Issue Must Never Happen Again
Following a Washington Post report regarding the West Calumet Housing Complex, I issued a statement condemning the decades of failure in East Chicago and reissued a charge for the federal government to step up in fighting lead contamination.   The Washington Post cites an inspector general report that says the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and other agencies did not follow their own regulations and failed to notify residents of contaminant risks.   I’ve sat across the table from families who lived in the West Calumet Housing Complex and saw their grief. Their government let them down, and we must never let this happen again. Not in East Chicago. Not anywhere.   I have cosponsored multiple bipartisan bills that will help combat lead in public housing, including the Get the Lead Out of Assisted Housing Act, the Lead-Safe Housing for Kids Act and filed a similar amendment to the Fiscal Year 2021 Budget Resolution in support of the removal of lead from public housing. 
Supporting Burma
On Friday, I joined the Indianapolis Burmese Community to discuss the recent military coup and reiterate my support for their people. I will continue to fight to ensure that they receive a free and fair election that they have fought so hard for. With Indiana being home to one of the largest Burmese populations in the United States, I will continue to ensure that their voice is heard in the federal government.
￼ 
I also visited the Indianapolis Clif Bar factory, which employs a large number of our Burmese American population, later that day to further discuss my efforts to support democracy within Burma.   
￼
Constituent Spotlight 
Due to the coronavirus pandemic, returning to the United States has become increasingly difficult for many Americans like Hoosier William McClure from Valparaiso. He was stuck in Nepal with limited access to mobile services and my office was able to help coordinate with the embassy to get him back to Indiana. In 2020, we helped 194 Hoosiers from 20 countries return to the United States. For more on how my office can help with issues like these, check out: https://www.young.senate.gov/help.

2/22/21 20:44,District Update: Weathering this storm together,"District Update | February 22, 2021
View Email in Browser 
￼ 
Dear Friends,
Last week, central Arkansas received more than 20 inches of snow. The winter weather may have tested our communities, but it didn’t test our resolve. Here are just some of the incredible stories from last week. 
The past year has been difficult for healthcare workers, and the snowstorm brought new challenges. I am proud of the teams at Baptist Health and UAMS, who housed over 200 healthcare workers last week to make sure patients were well cared for despite the inclement weather.
I am also extremely grateful for the many nonprofit organizations like The Van, Dorcas House, Jericho Way, Nehemiah House, and Union Rescue Mission who worked overtime to provide essential services to central Arkansans in need.
Finally, I would like to thank the state and local officials, first responders, and frontline workers who put in long hours keeping Arkansans safe and responding to last week’s winter storm. A big thank you to city, county, and state road department staff for working around the clock to keep roadways clear. Neighbor helping neighbor – that’s what Arkansas is all about.


ALL EYES ON ""GAMESTOP""
On Thursday, I questioned witnesses during the House Financial Services Committee hearing about GameStop. We had a very knowledgeable panel of witnesses which provided significant insight into the market volatility we have seen with select stocks, including GameStop, over the last few weeks. 
During the hearing, I asked Robinhood CEO Vladimir Tenev about how the company communicates with their investors. Investors should be able to communicate with their brokerage firm in a timely and effective manner.
All Americans should have the ability to invest in the stock market. While I am glad that Robinhood has made trading readily available, investors should understand the risks associated with highly volatile and low-dollar publicly traded companies.
On Friday, I joined Bloomberg TV to discuss the hearing. Financial technology firms like Robinhood have made investing more accessible to everyday Americans, but they must ensure users know their responsibilities and have access to customer support and consumer education in order to make informed trading decisions. 
￼

ADVOCATING FOR ARKANSAS VETERANS
On Wednesday, I held a virtual Veterans Advisory Council meeting with a group of nearly 30 veterans from Pulaski County. I appreciated the opportunity to hear directly from veterans about issues they are facing, including COVID-19 vaccines, delays in processing at the National Personnel Records Center, and their experiences with the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
It is an honor to serve the more than 50,000 veterans living in central Arkansas. I am committed to ensuring the men and women who have served our country in uniform receive the highest quality of care and services. 
￼

STANDING UP FOR OUR NATION'S STUDENTS
While the COVID-19 pandemic has been hard on all of us, I am especially worried about its impact on our children.  For many students across our nation, it has been nearly one year since they have seen the inside of a classroom. 
Arkansas has safely reopened schools in all districts, with 80% of students attending school in-person. Students who struggled with virtual learning are better able to learn in the classroom with face-to-face instruction and time to socialize with their peers. I hope the Biden administration will follow Arkansas's lead and safely reopen schools nationwide for in-person learning. 
On Sunday, the Log Cabin Democrat published my op-ed urging President Biden to put our nation's children first and get students back to in-person learning.  
￼

HIGHLIGHTING HBCU ACHIEVEMENTS
Congratulations to Philander Smith College in Little Rock on receiving a grant from the HBCU Cultural Heritage Stewardship Initiative to preserve their historic campus. I am proud of the work Philander Smith and the three other Historically Black Colleges and Universities in Arkansas do to educate our next generation of leaders. As co-chair of the Bipartisan HBCU Caucus in Congress, I am committed to supporting HBCUs in Arkansas and nationwide in their mission to expand educational and economic opportunities for their students.

SUPPORTING THE LEADERS OF TOMORROW
On Saturday, I held my third 2020-2021 Future Leaders Council virtual meeting with a special guest, my predecessor, former Congressman Ed Bethune. I enjoyed visiting with Congressman Bethune and a fantastic group of central Arkansas students. Congressman Bethune represented the second district from 1974-1985.
We discussed how a bill becomes law, the committee process, and the path to become a Member of Congress. The students also wrote their own “bill” about nutrition in school and wanted to make sure all kids had access to healthy and affordable dining options. They also included in their legislation enough time for their fellow students to be able eat and enjoy exercise! 
I am grateful to Congressman Bethune for joining us and to all our students who attended. I am proud of their curiosity and their commitment to exploring their interests. 
￼


DEBT REPAYMENT AND EVICTION SUSPENSIONS EXTENDED FOR VETERANS
On Thursday, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) announced it will continue the suspension of collection on all Veteran benefit overpayments and medical copayment debts incurred after April 1, 2020. The VA is suspending this debt collection to provide Veterans continued financial relief due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
To assist veterans with making informed choices for their situation, VA will notify veterans of their current debt and available expansive relief options. These options include making payments, extending repayment plans, waivers, compromises, and temporary hardship suspensions. 
Veterans and beneficiaries with questions regarding benefit overpayments can go to their website and view frequently asked questions and submit requests or call 800-827-0648. For health care co-payment debts, Veterans should contact the Health Resource Center at 866-400-1238..
In addition to the moratorium on debt collection, the VA has also announced it will extend the existing moratorium on evictions and foreclosures and extend VA loan forbearance requests to June 30, 2021. 
Forbearance allows veterans time to resolve why they are unable to make regular monthly payments and get back on a monthly repayment schedule. Missed payments due at the end of a forbearance do not have to be made up in a single payment. 
Veterans can call the HOPE Hotline, open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, at (888) 995-4673 for personalized financial advice. 
If you have questions or require assistance, please contact my Veterans Team at 501-324-5941.
Sincerely,
￼

Responding to Gas Pricing Increases Following Severe Winter Weather 
With many Kansans worried about a steep increase in their gas bill following the spike in natural gas prices last week, I am working with the White House to find federal support to limit the financial strain this event will have on Kansas families.  I’ve also been in contact with Kansas energy officials to hear firsthand the culmination of events, including mechanical disruptions, that led to this unprecedented spike, as well as engaged with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to help develop solutions to prevent this type of market volatility in the future.  Read more from The Newton Kansan here.  For more information on road safety and Kansas road conditions, click here. For information covering severe weather preparedness and making a plan, click here. 
  
Calling on the VA Secretary to Oversee Interagency Cooperation in Service to K2 Veterans 
This week, I joined with three of my colleagues on the Senate Veterans’ Affairs Committee (SVAC) in urging Secretary Denis McDonough to find answers and ensure care for veterans affected by toxic exposures at Camp Stronghold Freedom at Karshi-Khanabad Airbase (K2) in Uzbekistan.  Since returning home from war, those who served at K2 have suffered from increasingly high rates of rare cancers and other negative health outcomes. Last Congress, I supported legislation that was signed into law to mandate further research regarding the long-term health of servicemembers who were stationed at K2. This research, along with a January 2021 executive order mandating a detailed assessment of the conditions at K2, will help better determine how best to provide proper care for these veterans. These efforts show commitment and collaboration at the federal level to take care of our veterans who served at K2.  There is no group of individuals I respect more than our nation’s veterans, and ensuring they receive proper care and treatment is one of my top priorities. I urged Secretary McDonough to oversee coordination of these efforts and keep Congress, but more importantly, K2 veterans themselves, informed throughout this process. 
  
Supporting Law Enforcement Education at Fort Hays State University 
This week, I toured Fort Hays State University’s (FHSU) Center for Public Safety (COPS). COPS houses the FHSU Police Department and provides a controlled and secure environment for the convergence of all department operations. During my visit, I also had the opportunity to visit with Dr. Tamara Lynn, Chair of the FHSU Criminal Justice Department, and learned how their department is offering hands-on curriculum to prepare its students for a professional career in law enforcement, corrections or the legal system.  Currently, FHSU is in the process of becoming a regional de-escalation training center for law enforcement officers from a multi-state region, including Kansas, Colorado, Missouri, Nebraska and Oklahoma. This training will be offered both in-person and virtually, and it aims at providing special assessment and situational skills training that are needed to reduce conflict and avoid potential tragic scenarios for both citizens and officers. This past year, I wrote legislation for a new grant program to support organizations like FHSU in providing this important training to law enforcement professionals.  As the lead Republican of the subcommittee that funds the Department of Justice grant programs for state and local departments, I remain committed to supporting our nation’s law enforcement by ensuring organizations like FHSU have the tools they need to educate and prepare our officers. Thank you to Chief Ed Howell for providing the tour, and to Dr. Tamara Lynn and Dr. Paul Faber for taking time out of their day to talk to me about their great work.

Providing Oversight to Space Exploration Priorities 
Perseverance Rover Lands on Mars  This week, I visited NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), met with the leaders of the Perseverance mission and witnessed the rover land on Mars. This mission has been years in the making, and the Perseverance rover will exponentially advance our scientific knowledge of the planet while testing new exploration technologies critical to future missions and possible human exploration on the planet.  During my visit, I also had the opportunity to tour the Spacecraft Assembly Facility, the center of robotic space exploration at JPL. It was great to see first-hand the sight where the first probes launched to the Moon and all of NASA’s Mars rovers were assembled.  As the ranking member of the Senate committee that has oversight and provides resources to NASA, I look forward to continuing to engage with missions like Perseverance and helping set our country’s space priorities, as the talented teams at JPL and NASA continue to showcase our country’s leadership in exploration. This was an incredible feat during a particularly difficult time, and the team’s dedication and service to this mission is commendable. The opportunity to watch the Perseverance landing was inspiring as the United States achieves yet another landmark in space exploration, and I look forward to seeing the continued images and research that will be unveiled throughout this mission. 
  
￼ 
  
Seeing NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope  I also visited Northrop Grumman, a company pioneering space innovation and leading the industry team for NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), the largest and most complex space telescope ever built. Designed to succeed the Hubble Space Telescope and become NASA’s primary telescope for astrophysics missions, JWST will be 100 times more powerful than Hubble, providing scientists with comprehensive research that has previously been inaccessible. JWST is scheduled to launch this fall and has been in production for over 20 years. Last December, I also visited the Goddard Space Center which conducts the operations for JWST. Thank you to the team at Northrop Grumman and special thanks to NASA’s Acting Administrator Steve Jurcczyk for joining me during the visit and meetings.

Weekly Update | February 20, 2021
 

Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan Resigns

Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan has been the constant force in state government during Illinois’ steadying decline over the past two decades, wrecking our state finances and pushing policies that have run our state into the ground. During his half-century in office, Madigan has shepherded tax hikes, budget deficits, pension holidays, debt, and job-crushing regulations through the General Assembly, all while accumulating a massive amount of personal political power and enriching himself through his property tax appeals law firm. Because of Madigan’s failed leadership, Illinois families have been voting with their feet and leaving our state in droves.
 
Illinois will be better off without Speaker Madigan having the final say on public policy, but let’s not forget, he still serves as Chairman of the Democratic Party of Illinois and maintains much influence over politics in our state. And let’s be clear - Madigan isn’t resigning on his own terms. He is resigning in disgrace because he has been implicated in a federal corruption investigation that has already seen indictments of several of his close associates. Even as Madigan’s time in public office comes to a close, he should not avoid prosecution for crimes he may have committed in office. Federal prosecutors should continue their investigation into the years-long bribery scheme that was set up for the benefit of Speaker Madigan.
 
While Madigan may no longer be steering state government, the consequences of his agenda and poor policy choices will be felt for generations to come. We, along with the people of Illinois, welcome his retirement from public office, but now is the time to work to reform state government so that we never see another politician accumulate and wield power like Madigan did.

Highlights of Our Office's Constituent Services in 2020

Last week, our office released the following information about our constituent service work to help people struggling during the Coronavirus pandemic. The office set a record of 2,000 completed cases and achieved a 99% satisfaction rate. These numbers cover the 2020 calendar year.

I am extremely proud of the support my staff and I have been able to provide to my constituents during a year like no other. People and small businesses were hurting across America and my district was no different. Workers who had never applied for unemployment before, or never thought they'd need a check from the U.S. Treasury just to pay their bills were suddenly forced to confront the bureaucracy of government. Citizens found themselves stranded as a pandemic closed the borders of the world. Small businesses found themselves needing help from the government just to stay afloat at no fault of their own. My staff and I were there for those we are blessed to serve and will continue to be until this virus is defeated and beyond.

2,000 Completed Cases

That is triple the amount of cases completed in 2019 and double the previous high set in 2014 fueled by veterans needing help during the scandal at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). The top three issues addressed were related to unemployment, taxes, and international travel. There was also a significant increase in small businesses seeking out assistance.
470 Unemployment Cases

33 or 7% of these cases were taken on pre-COVID during the first 3 months of the year which is a regular amount by normal standards. However, as government-mandated shutdowns closed businesses and Congress responded by bolstering unemployment benefits we saw an unprecedented influx in those needing financial assistance. The most common issues were complaints about the Illinois Department of Employment Security (IDES) being slow to implement the expanded benefits and that once they were implemented constituents could not reach anyone at the agency if they needed help. Our office gave constituents the best available information and guidance as Governor Pritzker and his administration repeatedly failed those most impacted by the pandemic.

400 Tax Cases

17 or 4% of these cases were completed during the first 3 months of the year which is not an irregular amount for that period. The giant spike in cases (1,350% increase from 2019) for the remainder of the year was driven by two factors. First, Congress sending Economic Impact Payments (EIPs) to the vast majority of American households with an emphasis on getting out aid quickly left some wondering where their relief was. Second, COVID-19 induced Internal Revenue Services (IRS) facility closures delayed paper tax returns for the 2019 tax year. We worked case by case to resolve these situations so people got the relief they were entitled too. We also want to note that this number reflects those our office intensively assisted and opened up a formal inquiry on their behalf. Our office estimates that we answered basic questions from hundreds if not thousands of constituents related to EIPs that did not require a case being opened.

325 Travel Cases

62 or 20% of cases were conducted in March as global travel restrictions were put in place due to the COVID-19 outbreak. As constituents rushed to get back to the United States from across the world under sudden and unsettling circumstances our office closely monitored travel restrictions, provided guidance, and secured passage home for many.

60 Small Business Cases

While not one of the top areas by volume this area represents an enormous increase over regular years. Small business owners are known for their independent entrepreneurial spirit and rarely look to the government for help. As the Coronavirus and government ordered lockdowns shuttered their businesses they needed and deserved a lifeline. Congress stepped up and provided them relief that was implemented in a matter of days after passage. Our office helped 60 small businesses navigate issues with the Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDLS) and Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). Congressman Davis hosted a tele-town hall with over 300 small business owners and our office provided regular updates to Chambers of Commerce across the district.

99% Satisfaction Rate

Constituents who open up a case with our office receive a feedback survey after their case is closed. The feedback we receive allows us to continually improve the services we provide. For the year 2020 our satisfaction rate indicated very good or excellent service exceeded 99%. 

Constituent Service Spotlights

Our office regularly highlights ways in which the Congressman and his staff can serve constituents by sharing feedback we have received from those already helped. You can view the all of these on our Facebook and Twitter or search most recent #ConstituentServiceSpotlights. 
 


My Committee Assignments for the 117th Congress

For the 117th Congress, which runs from January, 2021 to January, 2023, I will continue to serve on the following committees in the U.S. House of Representatives: Transportation and Infrastructure (T&I), Agriculture, and House Administration. 

I have served on the T&I committee since coming to Congress in 2013 and have been a leading voice for infrastructure investment at the national level. I have worked to pass numerous surface transportation, airport, and water infrastructure bills.

I have also served on the Ag committee my entire time serving in Congress and has been a trusted voice for Illinois' rural communities and agricultural economy. During that time, I've helped negotiate the 2014 and 2018 farm bills, maintaining and strengthening critical programs for Illinois farmers.

And I will continue to serve as the Ranking Member (lead Republican) of the Committee on House Administration. I joined this committee in 2015 at the onset of the 114th Congress and was elevated to Ranking Member for the 116th Congress in 2019. This committee is charged with the oversight of federal elections and the day-to-day operations of the House. 

I requested to continue my service on these committees again this Congress because they have such a large impact on the economy and quality of life across Central and Southwestern Illinois. According to the Census Bureau over 285,000 of my constituents use roadways or transit systems to get to work and earn an income. Even more use our roadways for day-to-day and leisure travel. The Ag Census relays that 85% of the 13th District is farm land and that $1.9 billion in farm grown goods are sold annually here. These numbers clearly demonstrate that the issues these committees cover matter to my constituents. It is my honor to continue to be their voice in Washington, D.C.

Full Committee Assignment List: 
	•	House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure
	•	Subcommittee on Highways and Transit (Ranking Member)
	•	Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials
	•	House Committee on Agriculture
	•	Subcommittee on Biotechnology, Horticulture, and Research
	•	Subcommittee on Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit
	•	Committee on House Administration (Ranking Member)

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Files Three America First Amendments to So-Called ""Equality"" Act

Washington D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene filed three America First amendments to the Democrats' so-called ""Equality"" Act. This legislation expands governmental regulatory reach that destroys women’s rights, religious rights, and rights of the unborn. 

Rep. Greene's amendments would fundamentally change this disastrous bill to protect women and girls in sports, defend the rights of churches and religious, and allows individuals to sue the Federal government if their religious rights are violated.

Protect Women in Sports Amendment:
	•	Erases the ""Equality"" Act and replaces it with the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2021 to prevent biological males from participating in women's sports

Exempting Churches from ""Equality"" Act Amendment:
	•	Carves out 501c3 non-profits from the effects of the ""Equality"" Act

Religious Freedom Preservation Amendment:
	•	Allows Americans to sue or bring a claim against the government if their religious rights are violated

Congresswoman Greene issued the following statement:

“I’ve introduced these amendments to the so-called 'Equality' Act in order to stop this Democrat attack on girls, churches, and believers.”

Texas Winter Storm Update

The 11th District and the Great State of Texas was put to the test last week as millions faced freezing temperatures, extensive power outages, limited access to clean water, and devastating damages to our homes, businesses, and infrastructure. My own family lost power for multiple days and suffered water damage.

Despite the challenges, my team and I stayed in daily contact with city, county, state, and federal officials and agencies, as well as with thousands of constituents, to identify and communicate the urgent needs of the 11th District.

In addition to communicating with and advocating for our district, I took action to make sure we understand what went wrong with our power grid and ensure it never happens again.

Texas Winter Storm Resources

My office has prepared some resources to help you recover from last week's winter storm including: what to do if you receive an exceptionally high utility bill, disaster assistance information, how to recognize scammers, and more.

You can find those on my website here. 
 

We Deserve Answers from ERCOT

On Wednesday, I joined my colleagues in sending a letter to ERCOT offering assistance and requesting answers for why millions of Texans were without power during the winter weather emergency.

Notably, we asked to be provided with written answers for these critical questions:

	1.	How did ERCOT prepare for this weather event and anticipate energy demand prior to when the controlled blackouts began?
	2.	It has been reported that ERCOT will adjust rates to meet demand. How will this impact future energy prices in Texas?
	3.	How were the various types of energy generation impacted by the extreme cold weather
	4.	What is the likelihood of similar weather events impacting Texas’s electric grid again?
	5.	What measures can be taken to improve grid resiliency in Texas in the future?

You can read the full letter at this link. 

Imploring President Biden to Authorize Assistance for Texas Counties

On Friday, I led a group of 19 Members of the Texas Congressional Delegation and sent a letter to President Biden asking him to approve the major disaster declaration issued by Governor Abbott. You can read more about that letter here. 

Public Assistance for all 254 counties was approved by President Biden, but Individual Assistance was only approved for 77 Texas Counties—notably excluding most of West Texas and the 11th District. 

Individual Assistance allows folks to directly apply for temporary housing and home repair grants, low-cost loans that cover uninsured property losses, and other programs for individuals and business owners as they recover from the disaster.

Texans know that all 254 counties are suffering from exorbitant loss and destruction from the winter storm, and President Biden's initial declaration falls fall short of the actual needs of our state.

Yesterday, I rallied a bipartisan group of 27 Members of the Texas Congressional Delegation and sent another letter to President Biden imploring him to immediately approve FEMA Individual Assistance program for all 254 counties in Texas. 
﻿
Read the letter below or at this link. 

 
 
 

Texas Needs a Reliable Base Load

Last week was an example of just how dire the circumstances can be without power and energy. Texas must have a reliable base load for our energy grid and a level playing field for all forms of energy production. Watch my interview affirming the importance of the oil and gas industry here or below. 
 

Have Damage? Take This Survey!

The Texas Dept. of Emergency Management is asking folks to complete a survey and detail the damage they suffered as a result of Winter Storm Uri. This will allow us to assess the damage across our communities and properly advocate for the critical relief we need.

If you have damage, PLEASE take this survey. 

Thank you, TX-11 Heroes

My team and I stayed busy last week calling constituents and local leaders in all 29 counties across the 11th District. In the process, we heard hundreds of heartwarming stories of heroism, generosity, and Texans taking care of each other.

There are thousands of hard-working folks in our district who deserve a heart-felt ""Thank You"" for working around the clock in painfully cold temperatures to restore power and water and provide emergency services to our communities. 

Thank you to the first responders, powerline workers, healthcare workers, farmers & ranchers, energy workers, water workers, transportation workers, and citizens who have been working tirelessly around the clock in painfully-cold temperatures to help their fellow Texans during this winter storm. 

Each of our City, County, and State officials deserve monster-credit for the work they did as our voice and advocate at every level. It never ceases to amaze me how selfless and kind the people in this community are, even when faced with an emergency. 

I’d also like to thank the many citizens who stepped up to the plate last week to help their neighbors and community members during this turbulent moment. There were harrowing stories of folks opening their homes, taking to the streets for rescue efforts, clearing the roads of ice and snow, and much more. 

I am incredibly proud of this District—it never ceases to amaze me how kind, decent, and selfless the people of the 11th District are are. 

Our state still faces an uphill climb repairing monster water leaks, assessing infrastructure damage, investigating what happened, and ensuring we have proper safeguards in place to prevent it from ever happening again. This crisis has really tested us, but we have shown just how resilient we are.

For Immediate Release

Congressman Gosar Opposes Efforts to Abolish ICE
 
 
Prescott, AZ: - Today, U.S. Representative Paul Gosar, D.D.S. (AZ-04) issued the following statement after Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas announced his intention to reorganize the Federal Deportation Agency in such a way that would have the effect of gutting or abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). This is on top of the declaration by Biden officials earlier that ICE issued new rules forcing ICE officers to make written requests to supervisors in order to obtain approval to deport “low priority” illegal aliens. The “approval” process, first used under Obama, was rarely granted and allowed thousands of dangerous aliens to roam free. These “low priority” criminals endanger the peace and security of the nation, including illegal aliens with convictions for drunk driving, domestic assault, identity theft and other felonious crimes.  
 
“The Biden administration’s immigration policy is the most radical immigration policy our country has seen. Rather than protecting our citizens, the Biden policy is to open the borders and promote harm to our people, our economy and our sovereignty. Our border has been reduced to a completely unchecked open sieve. This dangerous proposal by Secretary Mayorkas will make our communities less safe and is an open invitation for crime. At a time when we need more ICE agents, this proposal goes backwards and reduces the enforcement actions against illegal aliens. Why do Democrats continue to call for defunding or reorganizing of our agencies charged with enforcing law and order? Every American needs to understand the implications of these open-border policies,” said Congressman Gosar. 
 
Background: Last week, during a telephone meeting with agency personnel in Texas, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas proposed taking members of the country’s 4,000-strong deportation force off the streets and converting them into criminal investigators. Tae Johnson, acting director at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, was also part of the conversation and agreed with Mr. Mayorkas’ direction.

2/23/21 14:29,Addressing the Student Loan Crisis,"February 23, 2021
Share on Facebook | Share on Twitter | Permalink 
￼
￼
As we continue to fight the health and economic impacts of the pandemic, families are being forced to stretch their household budgets, and for many, student loan payments are a large line item that causes folks to pinch pennies when it comes to paying for the necessities.
Thankfully, my colleagues and I have scored crucial wins to combat this crisis.  The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act and H.R. 133, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, incorporated language from my bill to provide student borrowers with immediate relief.  Specifically, they included the portion of my Decreasing Employees Burdensome Taxes from Student Loans (DEBT) Act, to allow employers to temporarily make direct, non-taxable payments up to $5,250 toward employees’ student loans.  I’ve been advocating for these policies since the 115th Congress. 
This Congress is no different.  Earlier this month, Representative Kathleen Rice (D-NY) joined me to re-introduce the H.R. 902, the DEBT Act to ensure folks can benefit from these policies well beyond the pandemic.  The DEBT Act encourages employers to contribute up to $10,000 per year to their employees’ student loans as a non-taxable benefit.  Ultimately, this allows student borrowers to keep more of their paychecks and helps businesses recruit and retain talented employees in the workforce.  
Because easing the burden of student loan debt is not a one-step solution, Representative Rice and I also introduced the Student and Families Empowerment Act, H.R. 891.  This bill would give parent borrowers, who often don’t receive a grace period, and recent graduates, twelve full months, instead of six, to begin making payments on their federal loans.  Interest would not accrue during these twelve months.  H.R. 891 would also remove the current $2,500 cap on deductions for student loan interest, and instead apply the same treatment used for home mortgage loans (a limit of $750,000).  These changes will ensure that student loan debt does not hamstring folks and allows them to put their paychecks towards buying their first home, establishing life savings, and investing in their future.
The bipartisan agreement on our bills gives even more evidence to the clear, overwhelming consensus: we need to take action to address the student loan crisis.  The current data is frightening.  Over 45 million borrowers owe over $1.64 trillion in student loans, with the average monthly payment ranging between $200 and $300.  
My colleagues and I have been willing to reach across the aisle to find ways to address this issue.  We know that freeing up more of student borrowers hard-earned money helps not just individuals and families, but local economies as a whole.  I believe the best solutions involve the private sector, as it will simultaneously help borrowers take control of their financial future, keep the government from adding trillions in interest accumulation to an already out-of-control debt, and provide employers an incentive to attract top talent. 
I will continue to work with Republicans and Democrats to get these commonsense policies signed into law.  If you would like to learn more about the DEBT Act, the Students and Families Empowerment Act, or other efforts to support student borrowers and our economy, please call my Lancaster office at (740) 654-2654, my Hilliard office at (614) 771-4968, my Wilmington office at (937) 283-7049, or my Washington, D.C. office at (202) 225-2015.

2/23/21 15:23,Baldwin Introduces Bipartisan Bill to Strengthen American Manufacturing & Create Jobs Across the Country,"

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
Today, Senator Baldwin and her colleagues U.S. Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Mike Braun (R-IN), Gary Peters (D-MI), and Robert Portman (R-OH) introduced their bipartisan bill to strengthen our Buy American laws. The Make It in America Act will make it harder for federal agencies to use waivers to get around Buy American requirements, requiring the federal government to give preference to American companies and spend taxpayer dollars on American-made products and American jobs. 
“I strongly believe that when taxpayer dollars are spent by our government, we should be investing in American workers and American-made products,” said Senator Baldwin. “The Make It in America Act has earned bipartisan support because it supports our manufacturers and workers by making sure we buy what America makes.” 
Each year, federal agencies spend billions in taxpayer dollars to buy products from the private sector. The 1933 Buy American Act requires federal agencies to give preferential treatment to manufacturers of high quality, American-made goods and products. Unfortunately, loopholes, waivers, and outright violations have allowed federal agencies to buy products overseas — leaving our American manufacturers behind.   The bipartisan Make It in America Act would close loopholes in our Buy American laws and make waivers public. For example, the bill would stop the use of the “public interest” waiver if a foreign contract would decrease American employment. The bill would also increase American-made content from 50 to 75 percent to ensure that manufactured products bought by the federal government are made with American-made components. The bill would also require that each waiver to the Buy American Act be publicly posted online with detailed justifications.   The bill would create a new “Made in America Office” within the Office of Management and Budget, charged with reviewing waivers to the Buy American Act and ensuring compliance with other Buy American laws. This office mirrors President Biden’s executive order to create a central office dedicated to enforcing Buy American laws.  Finally, the bipartisan Make It in America Act would give small- and medium-sized American manufacturers the first opportunity to provide products for federally-funded transportation projects.  
Read more about Senator Baldwin's bipartisan Make It in America Act here.

2/23/21 15:24,A Message from U.S. Congressman Garret Graves,"￼ 
Friends,
The recent winter storm that brought hardship across our region was the latest in what seems like an endless series of trials. But as temperatures rise and repair work gets underway, we move forward together.   Our state is no stranger to disasters, and I'll take the resilience of our people against any hardship -- every time. I have no doubt we will respond, adapt and recover from this storm just as we've done many times before. That's what Louisiana is all about.   I've enjoyed the recent conversations and meetings with many of you, discussing your priorities and finding ways to work together to build a stronger Louisiana. Thank you for your continued engagement. It's an an honor to represent you in Washington.  As always, please don't hesitate to contact me if I can be of any assistance. Wishing your friends and family a safe and blessed 2021.  Take Care,  ￼ Congressman Garret Graves

Graves Fights For Common-Sense Relief on Part of COVID Package 
The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee leadership is moving ahead with a $96,000,000,000 ($96 Billion) COVID-19 relief bill supposedly for transportation, FEMA and related industries impacted by the pandemic. Unfortunately, the committee chairman wouldn't accept any of our amendments -- or amendments from any other republicans on the committee -- that would have improved the bill and helped make sure funding gets to where it is actually needed. 

This one-sided bill completely leaves out major sectors that need relief, and the entire process ignored many bipartisan solutions to the challenges that COVID-19 poses. We are three weeks into President Biden’s unity tour, but I am yet to find an instance where he or his party are practicing what's being preached. That's frustrating, to say the least. 

Our proposed amendments would have helped maritime industry and airports, would have improved disaster response during the pandemic, enhanced future COVID-safe evacuations, stopped the ongoing Duplication of Benefits re-victimization, and accomplished other common-sense policy objectives. But every single one of them was shot down thanks to the hyper-polarized environment that has sadly become our politics.

President Biden's Energy Plan
￼ 
On the campaign trail, President Biden said that he would not ban oil and gas: “we’re not getting rid of fossil fuels for a long time.” Apparently, “a long time” means less than one week. What was obvious then is undeniable now: this was a flat-out campaign lie to get elected.

February 10, 2021 - Rep. Garret Graves testifies at a joint meeting of the House and Senate Natural Resources Committees 
State Rep. Jean-Paul Coussan led a joint meeting of the House and Senate Natural Resources Committees to drill down on the harmful impacts of Biden Administration moves against Louisiana’s energy workforce and economy.
 
We were invited to speak and made the case that the energy clamp down in the Gulf will not only destroys Louisiana jobs and way of life; but will actually results in greater harm to the environment and greater emissions.
 
Senators Bret Allain & Sharon Hewitt, and Reps. Buddy Mincey and Timothy Kerner accurately pointed out that these policies also undermine Morganza to the Gulf, State payback of the Hurricane Protection System, and overall coastal restoration. 

￼ 
Rep. Garret Graves fights for Morganza to the Gulf project, stuck in bureaucratic process 
I recently announced that the Morganza-to-the-Gulf Hurricane Protection project will receive $12.46 million in “New Start Construction” funding from the Corps of Engineers. The funding will increase flood protection and help preserve vital economic activity in South Louisiana. The project became eligible for this funding through legislation I co-authored with Cong. Steve Scalise.

Over three years ago, we began working with the Corps of Engineers to reimagine this critical hurricane protection project, incorporating lessons learned and insight from frontline experts, like the Terrebonne Levee and Conservation District (TLCD), North Lafourche Levee District (NLLD), South Lafourche Levee District (SLLD), and the State.

As a result, we were able to reduce the overall project cost by nearly two-thirds. Our state and local partners have committed nearly $1 billion in funding to the project so far. This win is going to open up an entirely new funding stream to provide the level of hurricane protection that citizens in Terrebonne and Lafourche Parishes deserve. 
Other South Louisiana Priorities in the Army Corps 2021 Work Plan
Key projects across Louisiana to receive funding.
This legislation was a major breakthrough for projects that will advance the resiliency, economic productivity, and environmental strength of South Louisiana. We’ve had countless conversations with the Corps to address the management of our coastline protection, levees, dredging and environmental infrastructure, and I’m excited to say the ball is rolling in the right direction.
One of our policy objectives has long been to expand available resources, to take a more proactive approach on completing projects, and to find ways to get non-government partners involved to expedite projects completion.  For too long, the Corps has been the only game in town -- and that is not working. We secured billions of dollars through five different agencies and increased the opportunities to pool resources to help break logjams on projects.
We will keep working with stakeholders at all levels – our parish presidents, levee districts, local businesses, constituents and leaders in Washington, D.C. – to get the job done.
Priorities in the Work Plan
	•	
	•	Lower Mississippi Comprehensive Management Study
	•	Environmental Infrastructure Projects in South Louisiana
	•	Bayou Lafourche and Lafourche Jump Waterway
	•	Houma Navigation Canal
	•	Atchafalaya River- Bayous Chene, Bouef, and Black
	•	Atchafalaya Basin
	•	Mississippi River (Baton Rouge to the Gulf) Navigational Projects:
	•	Mississippi Delta Region, Davis Pond and Caernarvon Diversions:
	•	Morganza-to-the-Gulf
	•	Baton Rouge Harbor
	•	Old River Control Structure
	•	Bonnet Carre Spillway:
	•	Sustainable Rivers Program (SRP)

SURPRISE MEDICAL BILLS!
￼ 
Nearly half of Louisiana’s privately insured adults were hit with a surprise medical bill at some point in the last two years – and the other half worry about it happening to them too. T

I have been working to fix this problem – and here’s some good news: in December 2020, President Trump signed into law a ban on surprise billing for emergencies, air ambulance and other types of costly care without a patient’s consent – and established a legal process that will give patients the ability to fight excessive charges not covered by the ban. The new law goes into effect in 2022.
 
This is a big win for patients, and now it’s onward with our continued efforts to lower prescription drug costs and make our healthcare system fairer, more accessible, transparent, higher quality and patient-centered. 

St. George Fire Department Achieves Class 1 Fire Rating
￼ 
August 2020 - Rep. Garret Graves Joins Zachary Mayor and Fire Department for Their Class 1 Rating Announcement 
We recently visited with the St. George Fire Department to congratulate them for achieving a Class 1 Fire Rating. The SGFD heroes put their lives on the line every day as they work to promote the safest community possible. 

The bottom line is that this achievement translates to savings for homeowners and small businesses. Plus, when the Comite River Diversion Canal – and the major drainage improvements to Jones Creek, Ward Creek and Bayou Fountain – are completed, homes will be better protected from floods, and homeowners will pay less in flood insurance too. 

Red Snapper Legislation Signed into Law
￼ 
Rep. Garret Graves speaks on the House Floor about the DESCEND Act 
President Trump recently signed into law our legislation, the DESCEND Act, which will help to improve fishing opportunities and fish populations in the Gulf of Mexico. It is estimated that over 500,000 Red Snapper die each year due to the barotrauma of pressure changes from being reeled in from the depths. Due to strict fishing seasons and a two-fish limit, anglers must throw fish caught out of season or over limits back into the water – resulting in hundreds of thousands of dead fish annually. 
 
The DESCEND Act means more fish, more fishing opportunities in the Gulf, more tourism and better sustainability of our fisheries. 

New District Office in Ascension!

We are pleased to announce the grand opening of your Ascension Parish office of Congressman Garret Graves located at:
 
Ascension Parish Government Building
615 E. Worthy Street, Gonzales, LA 70735
225-450-1672
*Please call for an appointment during Phases 2 & 3 of current Louisiana covid-19 restrictions
 
Constituent service is the cornerstone of everything we do. If you need assistance with a government agency (Social Security, VA, IRS, Restore Louisiana, unemployment assistance, etc.), please contact us. As your representative it’s my job to work on issues that are important to you. This works best if we are communicating. I'm excited to build on the successes we've had so far to ensure Ascension continues to be one of the best places to live and raise a family in the state. This is your District Office, so please stop by to visit and contact us if we can be of any assistance. It's an honor to represent Ascension Parish in Congress. 

Remarks at Ascension Parish Chamber Luncheon
￼ 

A big thanks to the Ascension Chamber for having me at their Luncheon in Gonzales.

Continuing to visit with the Chamber helps build on the successes we've all accomplished together as a community - ranging from interstate improvements, reduced flood risk, AIP grants for Gonzales airport or federal reimbursements for the 2016 Flood Damages to Ascension schools.

Some pictures below from the event.

Meeting with Louisiana Crawfish Producers
￼ 
￼ 
Louisiana crawfish are still very popular nationwide, but the folks who harvest the mudbugs were dealt a harsh economic blow last year. They are still recovering. Federal help to businesses and food producers last year missed this critical Louisiana sector.

We met to discuss support for these producers. State Sen. Rick Ward, Rep. Chad Brown and I are working with state and federal agencies to support these hardworking people who feed the nation. 

Flood Protection Meeting with Assumption Parish Residents
￼ 
Drainage is always a hot topic. We had a chance to visit - 6’ apart and via zoom - with concerned Assumption Parish citizens about flood protection priorities.

Looking forward to working with them and others in South Louisiana on developing the best flood mitigation to protect our lives, homes, businesses and communities. 
The heart of our culture can be found in Acadiana, and the heart of Acadiana is the Atchafalaya Basin. The Atchafalaya National Heritage Area - you’ve seen the big brown signs on the highway - is a federal-state partnership that helps remind us who we are while raising awareness that Louisiana is a special place. We met with the ANHA to discuss amplifying awareness and promoting their efforts to enlighten the world.

King Cake Diplomacy
￼ 
Every year for Mardi Gras, we bring some Louisiana to Capitol Hill and give King Cakes to other Members of Congress, key staff members and leaders in the Administration. This year was no diff... actually, everything has been different because of the pandemic -- but we didn't let that stop us! This is a simple way for us to share Louisiana culture and showcase our local bakeries with folks in D.C. And, a slice of King Cake is a great way to engage our friends on the other side of the aisle -- we like to call it King Cake diplomacy.

	•	Scam attempts can be made over the phone, by mail or email, through the internet, or in person. It is important to remain alert, ask questions and always ask for identification when someone claims to represent FEMA or another government agency.
	•	Do your research. Scam artists will usually come to you to offer their services — either at your door, on the phone or through email — so be especially wary of solicitors.

Urging President Biden to Approve Disaster Declaration for Texas
 
 
 
 
On Saturday, the Biden Administration partially approved Governor Abbott’s request for a Major Disaster Declaration for the State of Texas as a result of the 2021 Winter Weather Storm. However, this initial approval did not include a number of affected counties — including some in our district. I signed onto a bipartisan Texas Congressional Delegation letter requesting the approval of all 254 Texas counties for FEMA Individual Assistance.

From the letter: “The services provided by FEMA’s Individual Assistance programs are essential to helping states and communities recover from disasters. Although the initial effects of this unprecedented winter storm are beginning to dissipate, the entire state continues to reel from the aftermath that has left millions without power, potable water, and dwindled food supplies. These continued challenges are impacting Texans from all background and ways of life. While the full assessment of the damage may not be known for many days or weeks, the current estimates are in the excess of $62 million. Given the magnitude, severity, and duration of the historic winter storm, it is assured the actual damage will far surpass the resources of our local communities.” 

As Texans continue to recover from last week’s unprecedented storm, my team and I will continue working with communities, the state government, and FEMA to ensure needs are met. Please find the full letter HERE. 
 

Texas Congressional Leaders Ask ERCOT Critical Questions
 
 
 
 
Last week, I signed a letter to Bill Magness, President and Chief Executive Officer of Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), seeking answers for the reason millions of Texans were without power during this winter weather emergency, what is being done to restore power, and how this will be prevented in the future.

From the letter: “While it appears the significant mismatch in energy supply and demand during this cold snap was caused by a variety of factors, various narratives have begun to surface that must be addressed. Texas residents deserve to know the root causes of their power outages and how they can be prevented in the future.""

Besides asking questions for why this happened, we wanted to ensure that ERCOT had the resources necessary to quickly turn things around and get the lights back on for the millions of Texans without power.

We asked to be provided written answers to the below critical questions immediately upon the conclusion of this emergency:

	1.	How did ERCOT prepare for this weather event and anticipated energy demand prior to when the controlled blackouts began?
	2.	It has been reported that ERCOT will adjust rates to meet demand. How will this impact future energy prices in Texas?
	3.	How were the various types of energy generation impacted by the extreme cold weather?
	4.	What is the likelihood of similar weather events impacting Texas’s electric grid again?
	5.	What measures can be taken to improve grid resiliency in Texas in the future?

Food Distribution Centers Rally Amidst Severe Weather
 
 
 
 
Finally Texas is thawing, and we are on the mend. I'm so grateful to represent people who come together during challenging times to help our neighbors. So many shared water and supplies, served in warming centers, opened their homes to those without electricity, helped repair pipes, and more. 

I had the privilege of serving with the Food Bank of the Golden Crescent last week amidst the severe cold weather in our area. Thank you for being the kind of people who live with a generous heart. 
 

New $1.9 Trillion Spending Legislation Doesn't Tally Previous Spending

I cosponsored a resolution requesting the Biden Administration make clear how much funding remains unspent from previously enacted COVID-19 legislation. Led by House Budget Committee Republican Leader Jason Smith (MO-08) and House Oversight and Reform Committee Republican Leader James Comer (KY-01), the resolution requires that President Biden provide to the U.S. House of Representatives – no later than 14 days after adoption of the resolution – documents relating to any enacted but currently unspent COVID-19 stimulus funding.  

Congress is currently assembling a $1.9 trillion spending package that will fulfill many of the immediate domestic priorities of the Biden Administration. Yet $4 trillion in relief has already been spent since last year. The Biden Administration’s nearly $2 trillion spending bill would be the largest stimulus package in American history and comes less than two months after Congress passed a bipartisan $900 billion relief package.  

The Paycheck Protection Program still has $144 billion in unspent funds.  Moreover, the Congressional Budget Office has predicted the GDP will return to its previous peak by mid-2021 without additional spending bills. 

The House Oversight and Reform Committee recently held a markup of the $1.9 trillion proposal. Several Republican amendments were offered to provide oversight of the $350.1 billion in spending within the committee’s jurisdiction. I offered two amendments: one to prevent federal funds from going to states that place more restrictions on church operations than on secular operations and one to prevent federal funds from going to sanctuary jurisdictions. The Democrat majority rejected all of the Republican amendments, including mine. 

It is irresponsible for Congress to pass additional spending bills without accounting for all the funding allocated last year. An estimated $1 trillion remains unspent. American families have to make tough decisions to prioritize responsibilities and make budgets work. It is past time for Congress to do the same. Instead of continually burdening future generations with more and more debt, we should do the hard work of meeting our country’s needs responsibly.

I hope the Biden Administration will work with Congress to identify how the currently available funds have been spent before pushing through another $1.9 trillion in deficit spending.

BROADBAND 
Take a Speed Test Here. 
The sad fact is that many places in West Virginia simply do not have access to reliable broadband and the lack of access affects West Virginians every day. Back in 2015, the FCC released a coverage map that stated 99.9% of Americans had wireless coverage. I knew then what I know now: That is just plain wrong. 
HOW MAY WE HELP YOU?

My goal is for me and my staff to provide the best possible customer service for every West Virginian who contacts me needing assistance. While I have no direct jurisdiction in legal or administrative matters of any federal, state, or local agency, I welcome the opportunity to assist you in any way possible and to assure that full consideration is given to your case. See one of our success stories below:

MANCHIN VOTES TO CONFIRM AGRICULTURE SECRETARY TOM VILSACK  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), voted to confirm Tom Vilsack as U.S. Secretary of Agriculture.  ""Today I voted to confirm Tom Vilsack as Secretary of Agriculture. Tom and I served together as Governors, and I know from personal experience that he will work tirelessly to get the job done. Tom is undoubtedly qualified to lead the U.S. Department of Agriculture and proved during his previous tenure as Secretary of Agriculture that he prioritizes rural America and providing assistance to those who need it most. Secretary Vilsack brings experience and a steady hand to the Biden Administration and I look forward to working with Secretary Vilsack as he works to bolster the agriculture industry, expand rural access to broadband, and create good-paying jobs for West Virginians and Americans.""

This Environmental Assessment is a vital step towards the completion of the Passenger Terminal and Aerotech Business Park project at the North Central Regional Airport, which will create jobs and boost economic development in the region. 
MANCHIN, PORTMAN REINTRODUCE BIPARTISAN FIGHT FENTANYL ACT TO PERMANENTLY SCHEDULE FENTANYL-RELATED SUBSTANCES  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Rob Portman (R-OH) reintroduced the bipartisan Federal Initiative to Guarantee Health by Targeting (FIGHT) Fentanyl Act to permanently schedule illicitly manufactured and deadly fentanyl. In February 2018, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) issued a temporary scheduling order to schedule fentanyl-related substances that has allowed federal law enforcement authorities to bring criminal actions against individuals who manufacture, distribute, or handle fentanyl-related substances. This scheduling order is set to expire on May 6, 2022. The FIGHT Fentanyl Act codifies DEA precedent to permanently schedule fentanyl-related substances.   
MANCHIN: EPA PROGRESS ON PFAS CHEMICALS GOOD NEWS FOR WEST VIRGINIANS  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) applauded the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) decision to move forward on the Final Regulatory Determination regarding two per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) chemicals, PFOA and PFOS. The regulation, initially issued on January 15th, has been on hold since January 20th due to an across the board review of ongoing federal regulations as is typical under a new Presidential Administration. Following today’s decision, the EPA can resume the process of establishing a national primary drinking water regulation, including setting a Maximum Contaminant Level which Senator Manchin has been fighting for since 2016.

2/23/21 18:55,Proud to introduce Deb Haaland,"￼
February 23, 2021
Dear Friend,
This morning, it was an honor to introduce my U.S. Representative from New Mexico and Department of the Interior Secretary nominee Deb Haaland during her confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
￼ 
VIDEO: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich introduces Congresswoman Deb Haaland in the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, February 23, 2021.
Congresswoman Haaland is member the Pueblo of Laguna. She is a 35th-generation New Mexican. As many have noted, she will make history as the first-ever Native American Cabinet secretary, something that frankly should have happened a long, long time ago. Congresswoman Haaland knows firsthand how the decisions made at the Interior Department affect communities across the country, especially in rural, Western states and in Indian Country. 
During her hearing, I asked Congresswoman Haaland about the steps Interior can take to implement the Great American Outdoors Act so we can create thousands of jobs maintaining and repairing infrastructure on our public lands. We can put people to work immediately replacing roofs on visitor centers, repairing trails, and improving campgrounds. We also discussed why we need to prioritize replacing Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) schools that are creating dangerous learning environments and repatriating sacred Tribal items that have been stolen to their rightful owners.
￼ 
VIDEO: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich asks questions during Congresswoman Deb Haaland's confirmation hearing in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, February 23, 2021.
I have no doubt that Congresswoman Haaland's bipartisan experience and her leadership will help us restore our nation-to-nation relationship to Indian Country, and make conservation and outdoor recreation a key part of our national economic recovery. I am confident Congresswoman Haaland will use the best available science to restore our landscapes, open up new outdoor recreation opportunities for everyone, put our public lands to work in confronting the climate crisis, and help Indian Country recover and rebuild from Covid-19.
I am eager to support Congresswoman Haaland's confirmation so she can get to work protecting our natural heritage for future generations.
Sincerely,
￼

DROPPING IN THIS ISSUE:
- Idaho COVID-19 Federal Funding 
- Pandemic Relief Should be Bipartisan
- Working Hard for Idahoans as Finance Committee Ranking Member 
- Reflecting on Banking Committee Chairmanship 
- Military Monday
 
 


Idaho COVID-19 Federal Funding
This past year has been challenging for all of us.  According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget,Congress has allocated nearly $4 trillion in support, of which at least $2.7 trillion (over two-thirds) has been committed or disbursed, and significant portions of congressionally-appropriated money has yet to be spent or obligated.  Because of the robust federal response, and a relatively strong economic recovery, some local governments are doing much better than expected.  The Peter G. Peterson Foundation has compiled data on how much federal funding Idaho and other states have received to date.  According to its data, Idaho has received $9.047 million in COVID-19 federal funding, or about $5,062 per capita.  Idaho has put $772 million toward unemployment assistance and compensation; $2,942 million toward the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP); and $462 million for educational support.  Thanks to good governance and sound fiscal policies, Idaho’s economy entered this crisis from a position of strength, ending 2020 with a record budget surplus.  However, our fight against COVID-19 is not over.  We have considerable work ahead to fully recover from the coronavirus, and more targeted relief may be needed yet.  As we continue to work together on tough issues, I am confident Americans will once again prevail over our challenges.
￼
Pandemic Relief Should Be Bipartisan
Over the last year, Congress has come together multiple times to pass massive, bipartisan bills totaling trillions of dollars in relief measures to back the medical response and help American families and businesses weather the pandemic.  I have been encouraged by this bipartisan approach, and recent economic projections from the Congressional Budget Office, which estimates that already-enacted pandemic-related provisions, built upon the strong fiscal policy foundation we already have in place, will provide a robust economic recovery, with growth of 3.7 percent over the course of 2021.  It is disappointing that the new Senate Majority has decided to move forward with a budget resolution to pass quickly proposals that have failed to garner broad bipartisan support in the past, instead of focusing on policies that will boost vaccine distribution and help get people back to work and our kids safely back to school. The proposed budget directs the Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over major direct spending programs and all revenue and debt limit legislation, to increase the deficit by a staggering $1.3 trillion, without even determining or deliberating what polices would have the biggest impact in growing our economy.
I voted against the Fiscal Year (FY 2021) Budget Resolution the Senate passed by a vote of 51 to 50 on February 5, 2021, because it does not pave the way for fiscally responsible, bipartisan budgeting enabling targeted COVID relief and economic growth.  As we have done in the past, Congress should be working together on targeted COVID relief for families affected by the pandemic, and pro-growth policies that will allow employers to reopen and rehire.

Serving on the Senate Finance Committee has given me the opportunity to help make a positive difference in shaping important policy affecting the lives of Idahoans and all Americans.  The Committee’s extensive jurisdiction includes federal tax policy; federal social safety net and health care programs; and implementation of reciprocal foreign trade agreements.  I always look for opportunities to simplify our tax code, create jobs and help Idahoans save for retirement.  The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lowered rates for American workers and businesses, and spurred record growth and low unemployment.  It is concerning that, at the onset of this new Congress, our country may be heading in a direction that will result in higher taxes, fewer jobs and a record deficit.  My latest column outlines, that as the lead Republican on the Finance Committee, I will work to protect and build off the successes of the 2017 tax reform law and promote other economic recovery efforts.
Reflecting on Banking Committee Chairmanship
In the 116th Congress, I had the great honor of serving my second term as the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, which has broad jurisdiction over the financial system, from housing to sanctions to transit.  Much of the term was focused on the implementation and oversight of laws passed in the previous congressional session and on several important reauthorizations.  However, as the pandemic spread rapidly across the world, Congress was tasked with confronting an unexpected challenge unlike many have experienced in this lifetime.  As head of the Banking Committee, I helped lead negotiations in crafting major legislation to stabilize markets, facilitate credit flow and provide liquidity to limit the economic shock caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Read my column for a brief review of these and other actions of the Committee over the past Congress.
Military Monday
This month, I honored retired Navy Officer Zach Tudor.  Mr. Tudor first enlisted in 1976 before commissioning as a submarine Limited Duty Officer.  Before retiring, Tudor traveled all over the world.  On the USS Boston’s sea trials, he got to meet Admiral Rickover.  Mr. Tudor received many awards during his time in the Navy.  I have had the opportunity to spend some time with Zach, who now serves as an Associate Laboratory Director at the Idaho National Laboratory, and commend him for his continued service to our nation.  This month, Mr. Tudor received another prestigious and well deserved recognition from the INL--the Career Achievement in Government Award.  Thank you, Zach, for your service to our nation and your continued service to Idaho.  Read more about all of my past Military Monday honorees on my website.

WEEKLY COVID-19 NEWSLETTER
DATA COMPILED ON February 23, 2021 
Today, I participated in a moment of silence on the steps of the U.S. Capitol in remembrance of the 500,000 Americans who have lost their lives to the coronavirus pandemic, including over 1,979 of our 3rd District community members. This tragic and incomprehensive milestone is a dark reminder of the suffering that our nation has experienced over the past year of the pandemic. Together we must act quickly to end this unprecedented crisis and prevent any more lives from being lost. That is why I will be voting to pass the American Rescue Plan, when it comes before the House this week. 
￼
(Garamendi (center) participates in the moment of silence at the U.S. Capitol) 
County COVID-19 Cases Snapshot
Since our last update, the 3rd District experienced 1,639 new cases of COVID-19 and 79 more of our fellow constituents and community members lost their lives to the virus. With 155,673 confirmed cases, our district has an average COVID-19 positivity rate of 6.5%. However, we have seen an average decrease in positivity rates over the last 14 days of -3.7%. 
￼
  
All 3rd District counties remain in the Widespread tier, with many non-essential indoor business operations closed. For more information on the tiers and what they mean for restrictions in your community you can visit the California Department of Public Health’s website here. 
County COVID-19 Vaccination Snapshot
California has administered a total of 7,437,925 vaccine doses out of the 8,832,770 vaccine doses received. Counties in the 3rd District have administered a total of 418,331 vaccine doses.
￼
California is currently in Phases 1A and 1B of the state’s vaccination plan, which covers roughly 15 million Californians. You can find more information regarding the state’s vaccination allocation guidelines here. The State Government is responsible for distributing the vaccine and setting eligibility standards.

2/24/21 8:17,Share Your Concerns: USPS Survey,"￼

  
 
OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS, HAVE YOU EXPERIENCED U.S. POSTAL SERVICE DELAYS?
 
  
 
YES
 
  
 
NO
 
  
  
Submit survey to sign up for updates on my work in Congress.* 
  
Dear Lindsey,  As Central Virginians experience U.S. Postal Service delays, I have relaunched my survey to hear about your experiences, thoughts, and concerns regarding the USPS. If you answered 'YES' to the above question, or nonetheless would like to share your thoughts regarding the mail delivery delays you are seeing at USPS, please click here to complete my brief survey.
 
The Postal Service is a lifeline for so many in our communities, and I want to hear about how you are being impacted.
  
TAKE MY USPS SURVEY
  
Without a functioning USPS and strong support to Postal employees, many Central Virginians would not be able to receive lifesaving prescription drugs, fill customer orders, pay their bills, or receive letters from their loved ones.
 
I've been vocal about the ways in which a weakened USPS harms Central Virginians, and I hope many of our neighbors in the Seventh District will take a moment to share with me their experiences and their concerns. 
  
Sincerely,
Abigail

Dear Lindsey, 
 
I write to you today for the first edition of Ronny's Roundup with an update on what has been going on in Washington, and resources available in the aftermath of the unprecedented winter weather conditions we experienced in Texas last week. 
  
Connect with Rep. Jackson
To ensure you are receiving the latest updates from my office I encourage you to subscribe to my e-newsletter and follow me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. Please also forward this to your friends and family in TX-13 and encourage them to subscribe, too.

Winter Storm Resources 
Since Texas was hit by an unprecedented winter storm, resulting in power outages, my office has returned hundreds of calls and emails to constituents regarding available resources.
 
Thankfully it looks like we have made it past the power outages, but I know the work does not stop here. The aftermath has left issues with our water and food supply, and the State Legislature begins the important work of examining what happened and implementing changes to ensure it never happens again. 
 
Texans are resilient, so I know we will get through this together. Below you will find important resources and information, but please let my office know if you have questions or would like additional information.
 
Federal Major Disaster Declaration
 
Four counties in TX-13 are currently approved for federal assistance under the White House's Major Disaster Declaration: Cooke, Montague, Wichita, & Wise.
 
This will fall short of what's needed, so I have joined 25 of my Texas colleagues in sending a letter to President Biden calling for ALL 254 counties in Texas to be eligible for assistance.
 
This is how YOU can help. Please report damages you incurred from the recent winter storm and its aftermath using the survey linked below. 
 
The state will use the data in part to present to FEMA and the White House, which will increase the chance of additional counties being approved.
 
  
COMPLETE DAMAGE SURVEY
 
Farmers and Ranchers
 
Texas' farmers and ranchers are eligible for USDA disaster assistance loans for physical losses from the recent winter conditions. 
 
More information regarding the USDA's Disaster Assistance Programs can be found here.
 
These loans will be managed and distributed by your local Farm Service Agency office. Click here to determine which office is closest to you.
 
Individuals
 
Individuals who have had underinsured or uninsured losses in Cooke, Montague, Wichita, or Wise counties can now apply for disaster assistance from FEMA. During the application process please be sure to select the cause of damage as snow/ice, among other damages that may have occurred.
 
If you have damage from the Texas severe winter storms and have insurance, contact your insurance company to file a claim. When you apply for FEMA disaster assistance, you need to provide your insurance claim information.
 
Visit DisasterAssistance.gov or call 1-800-621-3362 to apply. 
 
NOTE: Small businesses should apply through the SBA before applying for individual assistance.
 
The Texas Department of Insurance can provide contact information for insurance companies and answer questions about how to file a claim. Call 800-252-3439 from 8AM to 5PM CT, Monday to Friday. You can also view insurance company contact information online.
 
Additional food assistance is also available in Texas through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Recipients may apply for replacement benefits for food lost or destroyed by dialing 2-1-1.
  
What happened?
The Electric Reliability Council of Texas' (ERCOT) annual winter assessment before this winter season assured the public of Texas that there would be enough power to meet peak demand this winter. Clearly, ERCOT fell short on its promises.
 
That's why I DEMANDED answers from ERCOT on Texas’ power grid failures and lack of preparedness so we can ensure this never happens again.
 
ICYMI: I joined Newsmax over the weekend to offer my perspective. Key takeaways: 
	•	The federal government should not regulate our power grid. The federal government breaks anything it touches. We are capable of solving this in Texas!
	•	What we experienced in Texas last week is exactly why the Green New Deal is a non-starter. The purpose behind the Green New Deal is to fully shift away from fossil fuels to strictly renewable sources. If we were fully reliant on renewable energy in this situation it would have been far worse. 
	•	We can’t be dependent on one form of energy or another country’s energy production—bottom line.

First Legislation, Standing up to China
I recently introduced my first piece of legislation as a Member of Congress, titled Opposing Business with Chinese Military Companies Act. 
 
President Trump stood up to the Chinese Communist Party in a way no President had before him when he produced a list of Chinese Communist military companies
operating in America and imposed critical sanctions on them.
 
This authority was granted by Congress in the Fiscal Year 1999 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), though no President had the courage to use it until President Trump came on the scene.
 
Now President Biden wants to abandon the important sanctions imposed by President Trump, making clear that Congress needs to change the law from an authorization to a requirement. That is exactly what my bill does! 
 
I am proud to take a stand against China's aggression with my first piece of legislation, and I fully intend on inserting it into this year’s National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).
 
Why it matters
 
It should be common sense to prohibit investment in Chinese Communist military companies, which threaten America’s national security, jeopardize American intellectual property, and aid China in carrying out genocide against its own people.
 
The National Defense Strategy rightly emphasizes the growing threat of China, so removing the sanctions and allowing American dollars to go to the Chinese Communist Party would be counterproductive to the goals of the Department of Defense. 
  
Legislative Roundup
Tough on Immigration
	•	Joined the Border Security Caucus.
	•	Sent a letter to President Biden voicing concerns on his recent immigration policies and the spread of COVID-19.
	•	Sent a letter to the Secretary of State and Secretary of Homeland Security opposing any efforts to weaken the screening and vetting of foreign nationals coming to the United States.
Taking Care of Veterans
	•	Cosponsored the Improving Confidence in Veterans’ Care Act which ensures only qualified medical professionals are working at the VA.
Keeping GTMO Open and Vaccinating Americans, not Terrorists
	•	Sent a letter to Secretary Austin expressing concerns about transferring prisoners from, and closing, the Guantanamo Bay Detention Camp (GTMO).
	•	Original cosponsor of a resolution opposing the vaccination for COVID-19 of detainees at Guantanamo Bay detention facility before the vaccination of American citizens.
	•	Original cosponsor of the Vaccinate Americans, Not Terrorists Act which would prohibit the US government from providing a COVID vaccine to GTMO detainees.
Protecting the Unborn
	•	Joined the Pro-Life Caucus.
	•	To date, I have sent 6 letters and co-sponsored 23 pieces of legislation that protect the unborn, limit access to abortions, and/or restrict taxpayer money from funding abortions.
	•	A few examples…
	◦	Defund Planned Parenthood Act – prevents any federal money from going to Planned Parenthood, which received over $550 million in taxpayer’s money while sitting on almost $2 billion in net assets. Instead, this bill directs $235 million to thousands of community health centers that do not perform abortions. 
	◦	Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act – prohibits abortion for unborn children who are 20 weeks or older, which is the age when the child can first feel pain.
	◦	Sent a letter to the SBA Administrator demanding that no money from future rounds of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) go to Planned Parenthood or any organization that performs abortions. 
Ensuring Secure Elections
	•	Cosponsored the Save Democracy Act, which would help protect future elections from fraud. This bill includes commonsense reforms to voter registration, ballot casting, and ballot tabulation processes in federal elections.
	•	Last month, I sent a letter along with some of my Texas colleagues in the House to Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton encouraging him to investigate election fraud offenses, and offering Congressional assistance and resources to enforce election laws. We must rebuild trust in our electoral system! 
Reopening Schools
	•	Sent three separate letters encouraging President Biden and his Administration to follow the science and stop listening to special interest groups on school reopenings.
	•	Science shows that schools can safely reopen. Studies also show the harm of virtual learning on the developmental, emotional, and mental health needs of school-aged children.

	•	$350 BILLION to bail out blue states like California and New York.
	•	Stimulus checks for illegal immigrants.
I will not stand for it! There is no reason we cannot make this round of relief meaningful and targeted. Instead, it looks like liberals are choosing wasteful pork and politics.

2/24/21 10:32,"Reminder: The Need for Bipartisanship, Vaccination Update and Other Helpful Information","
 
 
 

February 21, 2021
 

Dear Neighbor, 
 
I know many Americans and small businesses are still hurting and I want to work in a bipartisan manner to help them. However, there is still $1 trillion in unspent funds from the first five bipartisan packages that have been signed into law in the past year. We need to evaluate what is working, determine where the biggest need exists, and ensure accountability as well as transparency.  Relief should be temporary, targeted and tied to COVID-19. However, this is proving very challenging. In our most recent Committee hearing in which we reviewed plans for a new pandemic relief measure, Democrats blocked every single Republican amendment to the pandemic relief package including:
 
	•	Plans to ensure distribution of 2 million vaccines to people per day during the next 100 days 
	•	An agreement to set aside vaccines specifically for teachers
	•	Increased transparency over vaccine allocation
	•	Enhanced Mental Health and Substance Abuse Treatment for youth
 
I know many of my Democratic colleagues agree with some of these amendments. We have worked on similar measures together in the past.  However, the Speaker and Leader of the Senate are demanding the use of a partisan and polarizing approach, which is very disappointing. The next step when we return to Washington this week will be a Floor vote on a highly partisan package. This package is full of spending items that have nothing to do with the pandemic. It is nothing more than a liberal wish list that puts their political agenda before the needs of American workers, students, and families. Using the suffering of Americans to score political points is wrong, and I hope my colleagues will rethink this strategy. There is room to find common ground on the type of relief our country needs. 

 Continue reading for a brief overview of important information!
 

Vaccinating Seniors, Veterans and Others with Underlying Health Conditions
 
As of last Friday, more than 2.5 million Floridians have been vaccinated. We continue to increase those numbers every day. While the State of Florida is still currently prioritizing seniors and medical personnel, I am optimistic that eligibility will be able to be expanded soon as more of this most high-risk group is vaccinated. In the interim, I will continue doing everything I can to increase vaccine production and distribution to Florida. Here are a few significant developments:
 
While inclement weather throughout the country caused some temporary vaccination delays for seniors last week, I am encouraged that Florida is now slated to receive an additional 41,000 doses of vaccine this coming week.  I am also excited about this federal and state partnership which will start March 3rd. It will offer even more daily vaccine appointments throughout Tampa Bay.  You can register for those appointments by visiting the state pre-registration portal.
 
Additionally, we are making significant progress with vaccinating Veterans. As the VA celebrates the vaccination of the one millionth Veteran nationwide, our own local VA systems are continuing to lead the way. While Bay Pines and Haley are now making appointments for all Veterans 65 and older, they are hoping to expand to Veterans under 65 with high risk conditions very soon. 

Where to Register by County

Pasco seniors have a few options for vaccination. They can register through the Pasco County health department’s portal. Then at 2:00 p.m. on Sundays the county releases appointment slots. Seniors can log on at exactly 2:00 p.m. and try to register for one of the slots. They are usually gone within 5 minutes. They can also pre-register for the state’s portal and reserve their space in line. The state will contact them once it is their turn for a vaccine. Additionally, seniors can register through Publix, Walmart, or Winn Dixie. I would suggest trying each approach until an appointment is secured.  

Pinellas seniors have similar options. They can register through the Pinellas County health department’s portal. County health officials are contacting those who have pre-registered as appointments become available.  They can also pre-register for the state’s portal and reserve their space in line. The state will contact them once it is their turn for a vaccine. Additionally, they can register through Publix and Walmart. 
 
Hillsborough seniors can pre-register for the state’s portal and reserve their space in line. The state will contact them once it is their turn for a vaccine. Additionally, they can register through Publix, Walmart, or Winn Dixie.  

*Note- there are no county residency requirements for any vaccine in the State of Florida, which means residents of all three counties can attempt to secure a slot through any of the options mentioned above. 
 

Preventing Fraud 
 
Sadly, we have also seen a rise in pandemic related scams over the last year. It is critical that we work together to ensure the FTC is able to go after and stop scammers seeking to exploit seniors and other vulnerable populations during the pandemic. We must also continue to educate the public on how to look out for and prevent falling prey to these shameful scams. I will be hosting a virtual forum in early March to share helpful tips. Stay tuned for more information.  
 
I am also working to help these local victims of identity theft and to put safeguards in place to prevent similar fraud within the SBA business loan program. Below is information about one current scam. 
 
 

Advocating for our Nation’s Heroes
 
I was deeply saddened to learn about Major Richard Star's recent passing from lung cancer as a result of his service. It is critical now more than ever for Chapter 61 Veterans to get the benefits they have earned and deserve. I will be reintroducing my bipartisan legislation this week in honor of Major Richard Star, a true American hero. Click here to learn more.  
 

Thank you to all the employers who provided job opportunities to our local Veterans and military families as part of my targeted Job Fair last week. The Veteran community has been disproportionately impacted by high unemployment rates throughout the pandemic, and I was honored to be able to bring together highly skilled applicants with eager employers in Oldsmar.
 
 

Leveling the Playing Field

﻿Florida’s farmers deserve a fair playing field which is why my colleagues and I are reaching out to ask the U.S. Department of Commerce to remedy this new retaliatory tariff on our citrus products.  
 
 

Community Concentration 
 
My team enjoyed attending the Home of Foam Mattress Superstore's ribbon cutting at Gulf View Square with the Greater Pasco Chamber. Congratulations to the Sullivans on this second location of their family-owned business!
 

My team also participated in the grand opening of Kiddie Academy of Wiregrass Ranch, a new educational center in Wesley Chapel. It is always nice to see small businesses expanding. I congratulate owner Maggie Delgado and her staff and welcome them to the community. 
 

Additionally, my team recently had the chance to tour Tecomsys, a local, veteran-owned, small business. Design Engineers Abon Ackie and Frank Vassallo are shown below with some of the products they design and manufacture. TECOMSYS primarily specializes in developing military-grade antennas and receivers. 
 
 

Constituent Corner

I recently received this message from a local realtor who reached out to my office for help with a client who is a Veteran. 

I’m a licensed Florida Realtor in Wesley Chapel. Over the summer I began working with a beautiful family from Maryland. After spending time here in the area, they decided to make Wesley Chapel their forever home. Over the next few months, the more I learned about their story, the more determined I was to make this dream come true; the husband was a combat veteran suffering from severe PTSD and the toll it was taking on the family and ripping them apart. Moving to Tampa to be near one of the nation’s leading VA hospitals and treatment centers for PTSD was their motive to move.

Now, in order to qualify for their home loan here in FL, the lender needed verification that they would have employment here. The husband was given a verbal “no problem”. However, when it came time for his work to produce the letter for his transfer, it became instantly clear that the transfer was going to take more time and “red tape” than had been initially established when her first asked for the transfer and letter for the loan application.

To say he was distraught is an understatement. I decided that I wasn’t giving up so I walked into my broker’s office, told her the story and she said, “Let’s call the Congressman’s office….veteran’s affairs are one of his passions.” We made the call and immediately your staff accepted the task and started looking into how they could help. Within the week he had made calls, sent emails and got my client the transfer he’d been fighting for. As I sit, telling this story, my clients just signed a couple hours ago and will be on their way down to start their new lives here in FL within a few days. To Congressman Gus Bilirakis and your staff, THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU! I truly believe you have saved this man’s life and helped hold his family together. Please know that you did more than help a random stranger get a transfer letter.

This is just one example of the work we do each day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!

Sincerely,

Bergman Introduces Legislation to Name New Gaylord VA Clinic in Honor of Navy Corpsman Steve Andrews

Washington - Today, Rep. Jack Bergman introduced legislation to name the new Gaylord VA Community Based Outreach Clinic (CBOC) in honor of the late Steve Andrews. Andrews was a beloved member of the Gaylord community and a state legislator representing the 106th District, having previously served our Nation overseas at the U.S. Navy Hospital in Guam and as a medic in the 1st Marine Division and Marine 1st Force Reconnaissance Company in Vietnam.
Rep. Bergman stated, ""Corpsman Steve Andrews lived a life dedicated to service and to his fellow countrymen. It is my hope that our plan to designate the new CBOC in Gaylord – a place where we heal those who made incredible sacrifices for our Nation-- in his honor will be a small tribute to his legacy of service to our Northern Michigan community and the United States.”  Steve Andrews entered the U.S. Navy in 1967 as a Hospital Corpsman then subsequently served at the U.S. Naval Hospital on Guam and as a medic with the 1st Marine Division and Marine 1st Force Reconnaissance Company in Vietnam. For his actions in combat in Vietnam and for saving the lives of countless Marines, he was awarded the Navy Commendation Medal and received the Purple Heart. 
Following his military service, Steve worked as an entrepreneur and was later elected to the Michigan House of Representatives, representing Northern Michigan's 106th District. Steve served Northern Michigan for two terms and then turned his efforts to building his family and business. Steve coached and was a father figure to thousands of kids in baseball, football and more. He additionally served on the board of trustees of North Central Michigan College and was president of the Petoskey Regional Chamber of Commerce.   The new Gaylord VA Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) located at 2782 S. Otsego Avenue, officially opened its doors on Monday, August 24, 2020. The 18,362 square foot CBOC provides outpatient primary care, mental health, telehealth, laboratory services, home based primary care, women’s health and whole health.

Your weekly update from Congress

Hello Lindsey,

This week I met virtually with small businesses and chambers of commerce from across my district as part of my Small Business Advisory Committee to talk about the changes still needed to safely reopen and rebuild California’s 8th District economy. Their message was clear: Improving the PPP program and ensuring existing relief dollars are spent quickly is the best way to help our communities recover.

On Monday, I cosponsored a resolution requiring accounting of unspent COVID-19 stimulus funds as a way to support our small businesses and families still awaiting desperately needed aid. Current estimates show roughly $1 trillion in COVID-19 stimulus funding remains unspent, which is nearly 1 in every 4 dollars allocated for COVID-19 relief since the beginning of the pandemic. We cannot allow this money to go unspent while people and businesses continue to suffer in places like the High Desert, Inland Empire, and Eastern Sierras.

Countdown to Mars
 
 
 
 
On Thursday the Perseverance rover built at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory here in Southern California landed successfully on Mars. Heather and I were honored to join the mission team in Pasadena to watch the landing. This achievement is an impressive example of the innovations in space technology happening in Southern California. As a member of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, I look forward to continuing to help our space industry reach new heights.
 

Teacher of the Month
 
 
 
 
This week I surprised Lewis Center Academy teacher Amy Ritter with my Teacher of the Month award. Amy has worked hard to bring hands-on STEM education to students across our region and the globe despite the pandemic with local outreach field trips and the Goldstone Apple Velley Radio Telescope (GAVRT) Radio Astronomy Project. She is an amazing example of what hard work and dedication to students can accomplish both inside and outside of the traditional classroom.

Demanding answers on California's unemployment fraud

I’ve recently joined other members of the California congressional delegation to demand answers in response to confirmation that the California Employment Development Department (EDD) has paid out at least $11.4 billion in fraudulent unemployment claims. This level of mismanagement of taxpayer dollars is completely unacceptable and has serious implications for all American taxpayers, but particularly for Californians whose personal information was stolen by criminals seeking to capitalize on California’s broken system.

Congressional Report
 
 
Dear Friend,  
Last week, millions of Texans faced extreme winter weather - resulting in days without power or running water. We are still dealing with the after effects of this event and it will take time to heal. However, Texans never back down from hardship and we always overcome our darkest struggles. Communities across the state came together and displayed incredible kindness to one another, including taking in strangers without power and delivering food and supplies to those in need. 
 
As we begin to rebuild, I want to make sure you have information to help navigate your families’ recovery efforts.
 
Furthermore, our nation reached a tragic milestone that should remind us all about the importance of taking this pandemic seriously and ensuring that we are doing our part to slow the spread of the coronavirus. My heart aches for the thousands of families who have lost loved ones to the virus. As we mourn the lives of 500,000, I pray that our nation continues to find the strength to overcome this dire situation.
 
We cannot wait any longer – lives and livelihoods are on the line. For that reason, I’ll be heading back to Washington, D.C. this week to pass President Biden’s American Rescue Plan. 
 
To everyone across my district, the state and nation - help is on the way.

2/24/21 11:59,Fighting for Veterans,"￼
February 24, 2021
Dear Friend,
Last week, I visited the Raymond G. Murphy VA Medical Center in Albuquerque to discuss the needs of New Mexico's military veterans and their families. I wanted to personally thank VA officials and medical staff for their roles in providing COVID-19 testing and vaccine services to area-veterans, and for opening the medical center's ICU beds to non-veterans from the Navajo Nation during the pandemic.
￼
PHOTO: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich visits the Raymond G. Murphy VA Medical Center in Albuquerque, February 18, 2021.
In my new role as chairman of the Military Construction (MILCON), Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, I will oversee all funding for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), which provides health care services to millions of veterans, benefits to help service members transition back to civilian life, and national cemeteries that provide tributes to service members' sacrifice to our nation. I am committed to fighting for all the resources and funding the VA needs to keep America's promise to our service members and their families.
I am proud to have several veterans in my family and to serve a state with one of the highest rates of military volunteerism in the nation. Veterans deserve more than just words of gratitude for their sacrifice when they return home. They deserve the quality care and benefits they earned. In my chairmanship, I will be especially focused on ensuring a robust Covid-19 vaccination program through the entire VA system, improving telehealth services for rural veterans, and providing better health care and housing assistance for veterans experiencing homelessness.
My new chairmanship also oversees funding for new military construction projects. I am looking forward to taking all that I have learned over 12 years serving on both the House and Senate Armed Services Committee to continue strengthening the pivotal national defense role of New Mexico's military installations--Cannon, Holloman, Kirtland, and White Sands Missile Range--and our defense research laboratories. Personnel at our labs and bases must have modern facilities to execute their national security missions and contribute to New Mexico's economy.
My office has helped hundreds of veterans across New Mexico access their care and benefits. If you or a family member is having trouble filing a claim with the VA, receiving benefits, accessing health benefits or military records, replacing medals, or other veterans issues, you can contact my office by calling (505) 346-6601 or by visiting the Veterans Resources Center on my website.
Sincerely,
￼

Sen. Rick Scott: The WHO Failed the World on COVID – They Must be Held Accountable
￼
For nearly a year, Senator Rick Scott has been calling on Congress to investigate the World Health Organization (WHO)'s role in covering up the threat of the coronavirus. The WHO’s inaction, spreading the lies of Communist China, put the lives of so many Americans at risk and devastated our nation’s economy.
The WHO served as a puppet for Communist China’s misinformation and inaction on the threat of the coronavirus. Their actions are inexcusable and they must be held accountable. Last month, Senator Rick Scott introduced the WHO Accountability Act, to hold the WHO responsible for its role in helping Communist China cover up information regarding the threat of the coronavirus and to withhold American taxpayer dollars until significant reforms are made.
The WHO must stop being a puppet for China’s Communist Party, and American taxpayers should not continue to fund it until significant reforms are made. Senator Scott will continue fighting to get answers for the American people and hold the WHO responsible for its actions. 
Read more on Senator Scott’s efforts below.

Sens. Rick Scott and Josh Hawley Introduce WHO Accountability Act to Address Inaction and Lies About the Coronavirus Pandemic 
Earlier this month, Senators Rick Scott and Josh Hawley introduced the World Health Organization (WHO) Accountability Act to hold the WHO responsible for its role in helping Communist China cover up information regarding the threat of the coronavirus. The WHO Accountability Act withholds U.S. taxpayer dollars from the WHO until the organization replaces its leadership, as of January 1, 2020, and accepts Taiwan as a member state. It also limits U.S. funding to the same or less than the top contributor nation to the WHO each year.   Senator Rick Scott said, “The mission of the WHO is to get public health information to the world so every country can make the best decisions to keep their citizens safe. The WHO not only failed its mission, but it failed the world when it comes to the coronavirus. They served as a puppet for the Chinese Communist Party – parroting misinformation and helping Communist China cover up a global pandemic. Last February, I called on the WHO to do its own in-depth analysis on the extent and origins of the coronavirus. It took them nearly a year to take action and we still have no answer. They have even dropped their investigation into whether COVID-19 leaked from Wuhan lab. Their inaction has grave consequences.  ""The WHO also needs to answer for its refusal to include Taiwan in its membership, meetings, and information, especially in the face of the coronavirus. They are complicit in Communist China’s effort to isolate Taiwan. There is no reason U.S. taxpayers should be spending hundreds of millions a year, more than any other country, to fund the WHO without significant reform. I’m proud to introduce the WHO Accountability Act to withhold American taxpayer dollars from the WHO until they start actually caring about public health, stop acting like a puppet for the Communist China and allow Taiwan as a member.""

2/24/21 13:00,VIDEO: Interior Nominee Avoids Risch’s Keystone Pipeline Questions Six Times,"  
Contact: Marty Cozza 
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
February 24, 2021
VIDEO: Interior Nominee Avoids Risch’s Keystone Pipeline Questions Six Times 
WASHINGTON – It took President Biden’s nominee to lead the Department of Interior, Rep. Deb Haaland, four times to answer U.S. Senator Jim Risch’s question: “Do you support the President’s action to shut down the Keystone Pipeline?”
Once she finally confirmed that she supports shutting down the Keystone XL Pipeline and the thousands of American jobs it provides, it took Rep. Haaland an additional two times to answer why she supports shutting down the pipeline.
“One of the reasons I’m pressing you on this is I’m having real trouble reconciling [the move to shut down the Keystone Pipeline] with the fact that we can’t get the Administration to shut down the Nord Stream 2 pipeline,” Risch told Haaland.
Senator Risch continued, “How do you square shutting down jobs in the energy sector in the United States but yet permitting – and indeed encouraging – jobs in the energy sector in Russia? It doesn’t make sense to me.”
     
To watch Risch’s Keystone Pipeline questioning on YouTube, click here. To download the video file of Risch’s Keystone Pipeline questioning, click here. 
To download the video file of Risch’s full line of questioning, click here.
Background: 
Senator Risch, a senior member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has described the Biden administration’s move to shut down the Keystone XL Pipeline as “ flat wrong,” characterizing the project as “ a linchpin of America’s energy independence and job creation strategy.” 
Senator Risch serves as the ranking member on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and has been instrumental in the bipartisan effort in the U.S. Senate to halt construction of the Russian Nord Stream 2 Pipeline. If completed, the Nord Stream 2 Pipeline would increase Europe’s energy dependence on Russia and endanger U.S. national security interests.

ICYMI: Malliotakis: Cuomo and de Blasio can’t have their cake and eat it, too 
 

The Staten Island Advance 
By Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis (NY-11) 
February 23, 2021
LINK

As a new Member of Congress, President Biden’s current $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package puts me in a quandary. While there are many components of the bill that I support, like providing aid to restaurants and small businesses that were mandated to close and providing assistance for the unemployed, and returning taxpayer money to citizens in the form of a “stimulus” check, it is in no way tailored to the specific needs of our nation or its struggling citizens.

The Democrats’ package is a jumbled mess less targeted towards COVID-relief and more so a mechanism for funding their ever-growing progressive wish list. It is a massive spending bill that authorizes $1.9 trillion with little accountability, all as our nation approaches $30 trillion in debt and $1 trillion in funds remain unspent from previous relief packages.

A Wall Street Journal analysis found that just $825 billion of the $1.9 trillion in spending are actual COVID-related expenditures. Some of the pork includes $1 billion in unrelated transportation projects including $100 million Speaker Pelosi included for an underground rail line extension of the Bay Area Ridge Transit System, $270 million for arts and humanities endowments, $750 million for global programs, and $50 million for family planning. These expenditures are neither COVID-related nor an emergency. What they are is another example of government thinking they know how to spend your money better than you do.

Meanwhile, vaccine production and distribution, which is a top priority for getting our nation back on track, is less than 1%, showing just how bloated this bill is.

It also contains repetitive or unnecessary spending. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated it would cost $25 billion to reopen America’s schools safely. So far, Congress has allocated $68 billion, and now, Democrats want to spend $130 billion more. Only under a mismanaged government do things end up costing eight times more than originally estimated.

To put it plainly, it is DC political spin to call this a pandemic relief bill. It’s more like one big blank check for the Biden Administration. Now it appears President Biden has changed the formula from previous bills and instead of giving states funding based on population, they are doling it out based on unemployment rates. This means Governor Cuomo, who oversees the state with the highest unemployment, will be rewarded for his business crushing restrictions and excessive shutdowns to the tune of $50 billion. But will struggling citizens and small businesses hanging onto a thread see any of it?

They say the best stimulus is a reopened economy and the best relief is a steady paycheck. I agree, but I also understand the financial impact the last several months have placed on local budgets. Of course, as a New Yorker, I want my city and state to receive federal funds, but I also want accountability.

New York City and State have a long history of misusing taxpayer money. Look no further than the increased homelessness and crime raging on our streets, or the disrepair of our roads and highways. Where did the billions that the mayor allocated for Thrive NYC or his Renewal Schools program really go? Why has New York State not fully reopened our schools despite taking $4 billion in federal aid to do so?

The mayor and governor have imposed some of the highest taxes in the country on the working men and women of our state. These tax increases have triggered a mass exodus of taxpayers to states like Florida and Texas that have no personal income tax. According to the Empire Center for Public Policy, between 2010 and 2019, New York State lost upwards of 1.4 million residents to other states, and sadly, COVID-19 has only exacerbated this loss. And we all know that when high-income earners leave, it is the rest of us, the middle-class, who are left carrying the bag.

Governor Cuomo has already threatened to increase personal income taxes, Mayor de Blasio almost certainly plans to increase the property tax levy and the MTA Board (controlled by both the mayor and the governor) just voted to increase tolls on its New York City bridges – including the Verrazzano Bridge – despite receiving $8 billion in federal aid thus far with billions more on the way.

Last week I wrote to Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo asking them for a commitment to not raise income taxes and the property tax levy if they receive federal aid and use a portion of the funds to stop the toll increases and provide relief to the small businesses they shut down. So far, my calls have gone unanswered, but I’ll keep pushing. 

The worst thing the governor and mayor could do is accept the federal aid and still move forward with their anticipated toll and tax increases. It would not only be double-dipping on the part of the city and state governments, but it would be a slap in the face to our middle-class families who are struggling to get by during this pandemic and can’t afford increases to their daily cost of living.

Cuomo and de Blasio can’t have their cake and eat it too. But if everyone’s looking the other way, that may be what exactly what they do.

2/24/21 14:31,Do you support a $15 minimum wage?,"
 
 
 

Dear Hoosiers,
 
This week, the House is considering the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion reconciliation package for COVID-19 relief. While only about 9% of the bill’s funding will be used to help combat the biological effects of this virus, the rest of the package’s funding will be spent on codifying multiple partisan priorities, such as a provision to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. 
 
Proponents of the federal minimum wage hike cite the need to keep up with an increasing cost of living. The federal minimum wage has not increased since 2009, and many view this stagnation as repressive to workers across the country. Raising the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour would increase the wages of about 21% of the current U.S. workforce by 2025, and 59% of workers whose income falls near the poverty line would be affected.  
 
Opponents of a federal minimum wage increase note this drastic rise would endanger small businesses and employees across our country as employers are forced to increase wages based on a government mandate, not based on the actual cost of goods and services. The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office states that raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour would directly strip 1.4 million Americans of their hard-earned jobs as employers automate or combine low-wage positions in order to absorb the cost—hammering many of the low-income families this raise is meant to help. Each job lost would be a critical hit to American livelihoods and the strength and stability of small businesses. 
 
QUESTION OF THE WEEK: Do you think Congress should increase the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour at the risk of losing millions of American jobs? 
 
[_] Yes, I think we should raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour 
[_] No, I don’t think we should raise the federal minimum wage 
[_] I don’t know 
[_] Other

2/24/21 16:55,ICYMI: Congressman Allen Holds Telephone Town Hall,"￼ 
ICYMI: CONGRESSMAN ALLEN
HOLDS TELEPHONE TOWN HALL 

WASHINGTON – Congressman Rick W. Allen (GA-12) held a telephone town hall Tuesday night to answer questions from residents of Georgia's 12th District. Congressman Allen gave an update on President Biden’s executive orders, COVID-19 relief, legislation to reopen schools, and more. For those who were unable to participate in the call, here are some of the highlights: 

Sharon from Evans asked about concerns with election integrity.

Congressman Allen: “I agree with you, I believe that the American people deserve full transparency… [that’s] one of the reasons I signed the amicus brief that urged the Supreme Court to consider a case to determine the constitutionality of changes to our election processes that were unilaterally made without the consent of state legislators. While it was not heard by the U.S. Supreme Court, I will continue to fight for this transparency and fairness. 

“The bottom line is you don’t have the same guidelines for in-person voting that you do for mail-in or absentee voting, and that’s unequal representation under the law. It’s much easier to register and get an absentee ballot and the only way to check that is a signature verification at the polling area… and two things that we need to know on those absentee votes is 1) That you have a voter ID, so that you need to submit a copy of that with your absentee ballot. 2) I think that we need to know that you actually live in the precinct that you are voting in. That matters, particularly in local elections. So those are two important pieces to the voter certification. Let me tell you, we want everybody to have the opportunity to vote, but we don’t want to take away anybody’s vote with an irregular vote, so I am with you 100%.”

￼

Melanie from Dublin asked about issues with Social Security and Medicare.

Congressman Allen: “Let me tell you- if you have got someone who is having a problem with the federal government like Social Security or Medicare, please do not hesitate to pick up the phone and call our Augusta office at 706-228-1980. We also have a Dublin office which might be a little closer to you, and that number is 478-272-4030...

“Please have your folks contact our caseworkers and we will get to the bottom of it. I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. As I said earlier on the call, if any of you are having problems with the federal government, whether that be VA, Social Security, Medicare you name it... We are there for you and we would be glad to assist you.”

￼

Bonnie from Statesboro asked about President Biden’s immigration agenda and what Congress is doing to secure the border.

Congressman Allen: “We have the most accessible immigration law and are by far the most generous in the world… We have COVID right now and [Biden’s policy] is the worst policy, and I do not know how this administration is getting away with this. I am telling you that it is going to create real problems, our law enforcement is overburdened down there and border patrol they can’t deal with this…Like I said, it took President Trump three of his four years to get that thing fixed down there…we were getting that border wall built to help our border patrol because all that does is help them do their job, and we owe that to them. They put their lives on the line every day and there are some bad people showing up at that border… 

“We are in a fight and we are going to keep fighting and hopefully we will get back to commonsense policy really soon.”

￼

Susan from Springfield asked about COVID-19 vaccine availability.

Congressman Allen: “The vaccine was developed in warp speed, nothing like this has ever been achieved in medical history. The delivery of the vaccine could have been delayed until they had built more inventory, but we wanted to go ahead and try to get folks vaccinated, and obviously the deployment of the vaccine has gone much better than the supply. The problem with the vaccine is the supply…

“... obviously the elderly and certainly folks with preexisting conditions need to get their vaccines. We will continue to work on it.”

February 24, 2021
Dear Friend,
As millions of Americans face continued hardship from the COVID-19 pandemic, I am doing everything in my power to fight for the support New Mexicans need, the science-based public health response necessary to save lives, and economic investments to rebuild our communities. 
Last week, I visited a mobile outreach site for Albuquerque Health Care for the Homeless (AHCH) to see firsthand how health care providers on the front lines are confronting this public health crisis. I am so thankful for all that AHCH does every day to provide comprehensive health and integrated supportive services to those experiencing homelessness. 
￼
PHOTO: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich visits a mobile outreach site for Albuquerque Health Care for the Homeless, February 17, 2021.
During my visit, I heard about how much the federal funding we passed in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act has helped the center continue its work.
As we enter the next phase of pandemic response, I am committed to helping President Biden pass his American Rescue Plan that includes funding for equitable testing and vaccine distribution, increases funding for community health centers, extends the eviction moratorium through September.  The president's plan would also provide assistance for renters and small landlords to help make ends meet.
While we are making significant progress in tackling the virus, there are still difficult days ahead. Please don't hesitate to contact my office if there is any way that I can be of assistance to you or your family. 
Sincerely,
￼

Important Updates to the 
Paycheck Protection Program
 
 
The Biden Administration has made critical reforms to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) to better support small businesses across New Jersey's 7th Congressional District. Expanding PPP access to America’s hardest-hit businesses will save jobs and provide a much-needed boost to the economy. To learn about the recent changes to PPP and how your business may benefit, click here. For additional resources and for information directly from the Small Business Administration, click here.
 
￼
 
Earlier this month, Tom hosted a PPP Loan Application and Forgiveness Webinar for small business owners in the 7th district. Tom was joined by Al Titone, the New Jersey District Director for the U.S. Small Business Administration. You can watch a full recording of the webinar here. You can find additional information from our office about the relief available here.

2/25/21 11:32,Bacon Brief: Protecting religious freedoms,"￼
February 25, 2021
 
Protecting Religious Freedom is not Optional
 
Dear friend,
 
This week Speaker Pelosi will bring up the Equality Bill for a vote that expands the Civil Rights Law to LGBTQ citizens. While we should be able to protect our LGBTQ population, we should not do so at the expense of faith-based organizations and women athletes. Unfortunately, the Speaker refuses to add religious protections that will protect churches, and faith-based organizations such as schools, adoption agencies, and homeless shelters. The Equality Bill if made law will be used to attack faith-based communities who publicly hold to traditional views of marriage. The First Amendment should guide our policy, and Freedom of Religion is one of our most basic rights and one that I have sworn to protect.  
 
Further, the Equality Bill does not protect Title IX sports which has opened the doors for women to participate equally in our High School and College athletics. Title IX has been a huge victory for women. My sister played NCAA basketball and went to the Final Four in the late 1980s and Title IX made that possible.  The Equality Bill mandates schools to allow transgendered women/biological men to play on women's teams, and this will surely undermine the gains we’ve made in raising the equity of women athletics. We should protect women in this legislation, but thus far Speaker Pelosi refuses to do so.
 
We live in a pluralistic society where we have citizens of various faiths and views.  It is a strength of America. We must work together to find a balance in the Equality legislation that further protects our LGBTQ population, but also protects faith-based organizations and women's sports.  Speaker Pelosi refuses to work towards a compromise, and therefore this bill is unlikely to pass a Senate filibuster.  Her refusal ultimately hurts our LGTBQ and faith-based communities, and Americans.
 
 
Sincerely,
￼
  
Don Bacon, Member of Congress

2/25/21 13:43,Judge Merrick Garland & Restoring Faith in the Rule of Law,"The Durbin Report: A message from Senator Richard J. Durbin 
￼


Fellow Illinoisan,   This week, I presided over my first hearing as Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee as we considered the nomination of Judge Merrick Garland to be the next Attorney General of the United States.  There are few moments in history where the role of the Attorney General—and the occupant of that post—have mattered more.    Should Judge Garland be confirmed, and I have every confidence that he will be, he will oversee the Justice Department at an existential moment in its long and storied history.  After four tumultuous years of intrigue, controversy, and brute political force, the future of the Department is clearly in the hands of the next Attorney General.
￼
DURBIN TO GARLAND: YOU CAN RESTORE THE FAITH OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THE RULE OF LAW 
The Justice Department in the previous administration fanned the flames of discrimination.  It bowed to political pressure and began to function as the sitting President’s personal law firm.  But a restored Justice Department—a Department under new leadership—can, and I believe will, meet this important moment.  At a time when the right to vote is under constant assault, when the criminal justice system is in urgent need of reform, when too many Americans face inequality in their daily lives, and when the January 6 attack on the Capitol highlighted the urgent threat of domestic terror, we need the Department of Justice to step up and confront these realities.   Judge Garland’s honesty and integrity shone throughout both days of his nomination hearing. I am confident that he can rebuild the Department’s once hallowed halls, restore the faith of the American people in the rule of law, and deliver equal justice.  It will not be easy, but Judge Garland is the perfect person for this job.  I look forward to his swift and bipartisan confirmation.    Sincerely,   U.S. Senator Dick Durbin (D-IL)

Beatty Strongly Supports George Floyd Justice in Policing Act 
Congresswoman Beatty joins bicameral group of lawmakers to help introduce landmark law enforcement reform piece of legislation
U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03), Chair of the powerful Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), joined forces with U.S. Congresswoman Karen Bass (CA-37), House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerrold Nadler (NY-10), and a whole host of Members of Congress and Senators to introduce the  George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. This comprehensive reform bill seeks to improve police accountability, change the culture of law enforcement, and build trust between law enforcement, communities of color, and the American people.
“We cannot bring back George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Andre Hill, Casey Goodson, Jr., or the countless men and women who have died or been injured senselessly by law enforcement, but we can prevent similar tragedies in the future,” Beatty said. “The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act will do precisely that by guaranteeing transparency and accountability from the very people sworn to protect and serve all Americans—and at the same time ensure justice for every one of us.” She continued, “That is why I am proud to cosponsor this much-needed, long overdue bill and have made its passage a top priority for the Congressional Black Caucus.” 
To that effect, Beatty earlier this week unveiled the CBC’s ‘100 Day Plan’ that highlights numerous legislative and policy recommendations, including the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act. For more information, please visit Beatty’s website.
 If enacted into law, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act would:
	•	Prohibit federal, state, and local law enforcement from racial, religious, and discriminatory profiling and mandate training on racial, religious, and discriminatory profiling for all law enforcement.
	•	Ban chokeholds, carotid holds, and no-knock warrants at the federal level and limit the transfer of military-grade equipment to state and local law enforcement.
	•	Mandate the use of dashboard cameras and body cameras for federal officers and require state and local law enforcement to use existing federal funds to ensure the use of police body cameras.
	•	Establish a National Police Misconduct Registry to prevent problematic officers who are fired or leave an agency from moving to another jurisdiction without any accountability.
	•	Amend federal criminal statute from ‘willfulness’ to a ‘recklessness’ standard to successfully identify and prosecute police misconduct.  
	•	Create public safety innovation grants for community-based organizations to create local commissions and task forces to help communities to re-imagine and develop concrete, just and equitable public safety approaches.  
	•	Develop law enforcement training programs to institute best practices and require the creation of law enforcement accreditation standard recommendations based on former President Obama’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing.
	•	 Reform qualified immunity so that individuals are not barred from recovering damages when police violate their constitutional rights.
	•	Require state and local law enforcement agencies to report use of force data, disaggregated by race, sex, disability, religion and age.
	•	 Improve the use of pattern and practice investigations at the federal level by granting the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division subpoena power and create a grant program for state attorneys general to develop authority to conduct independent investigations into problematic police departments.
	•	Set up a Department of Justice task force to coordinate the investigation, prosecution and enforcement efforts of federal, state and local governments in cases related to law enforcement misconduct.

2/25/21 14:39,ICYMI: Our hearing with the Postmaster General,"￼

Dear Neighbor,
 
Yesterday, the Oversight and Reform Committee held a hearing on the dire need for change at the US Postal Service. I had the opportunity to question Postmaster General Louis DeJoy and the Chairman of the Postal Board of Governors, Ron Bloom, about the politically-motivated operational changes that have crippled the Postal Service and led to record low performance.
 
Despite all the gaslighting from enablers of the former president, who would rather we forgot about the damage caused by President Trump's monthslong campaign to sabotage the Postal Service, the facts here aren't up for debate. Louis DeJoy, and the Board of Governors that hired him, oversaw a political crusade to undermine the Postal Service and influence an election.
 
We know the truth. The Postmaster General and the Chairman of the Board of Governors need to answer for it.
 
You can watch my full line of questioning here, and I'll also include a copy of my full opening statement below. 
 
 
 
￼
 
 
  
Opening Statement
Chairman Gerald E. Connolly
Committee on Oversight and Reform
Comprehensive Postal Reform
 
February 24, 2021
 
I want to thank the Chairwoman for her continued commitment to addressing the financial and operational challenges of the U.S. Postal Service — and for focusing on the long-term success of the Service at one of her first hearings in the 117th Congress.  I am committed to working with the Chairwoman to get a bill through this Congress that addresses the longstanding and pressing challenges that plague the Postal Service and prevent it from achieving financial health.
 
Exactly seven months ago today, we had a hearing with Mr. DeJoy sitting before us as we attempted to untangle his ill-conceived operational changes at the Postal Service.  As I noted at that hearing in August, the Postal Service has been a critical lynchpin of the American fabric since 1775.  It employs 650,000 people and is the foundation for a more than $1.7 trillion mailing industry that employs more than 7.5 million people.
 
This hearing today serves to inform Congress of the reforms needs to return the Postal Service to financial health.  These efforts are not new, and certainly not new to me.  I was elected to Congress shortly after enactment of the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act in December 2006.  The bill sought to “modernize” the postal service and make it “healthy and affordable,” according to the floor speech of my predecessor Tom Davis, offered in support of the postal reform bill on the floor of the House in 2006.  With that bill, Members began the novel requirement for the Postal Service to pre-pay its retiree health benefit funds, thereby sowing into the Postal Service operations processes and requirements that prevent the service from achieving financial success.  
 
I have been working for 12 years, since I entered Congress, to build broad coalitions of multifarious stakeholders who rely on the postal service for their businesses and nonprofits — and for veterans who get their prescription medications through the mail, the rural Americans who rely on package delivery to make it through the pandemic, and the individuals who pay their bills through the mail. 
 
In the 115th Congress, I worked with my friend, the former Chairman of this Committee Elijah Cummings, to build a delicate coalition of stakeholders — some diametrically opposed to the others — to come together and support a reform bill that not everyone loved, but they all supported.  We have done this before and we can do it again. Reform is in reach.  It just takes a lot of work and deliberation. And I’m ready. 
 
The challenges to success are great.  I know I’m not the only one on this dais getting flooded with calls from constituents who are still not getting their mail and packages on time.  I have calls from grandmas heartbroken that their grandchildren are just now getting their holiday presents delivered. I have families getting charged fees because their bill payments are arriving weeks late. It’s no longer funny to say “the check’s in the mail.”
 
Earlier this month, I sent a letter to the Postal Service about the skyrocketing number of COVID-19 infections and deaths among the brave frontline postal employees serving this nation every day.  In early February, more than 16,000 employees were under quarantine restrictions. The Postal Service itself reported that by December 14,000 employees had contracted COVID-19 and 119 members of its staff had died.  We don’t know how many have contracted the virus or died since then because the Postal Service refuses to provide such data publicly, following the lead of numerous other federal agencies. But that is one step in the right direction after a series of catastrophic decisions made by Postal Service leadership over the past year.
 
It was particularly unhelpful when the man handpicked by the Board of Governors to serve as the Postmaster General (PMG) implemented significant operational changes without stopping to investigate or test them.  He took this action in the midst of the pandemic, when the Postal Service was literally a lifeline for millions of families — particularly older Americans or those in rural and remote areas.  The move plummeted the Postal Service into a death spiral of historically low service standards performance. We are now working to clean up that mess and find a viable path forward for our nation’s most trusted federal agency.
 
Mr. DeJoy, you have recklessly cut hours and delayed delivery times in the pursuit of unsupported “operational efficiencies.”  But you are hardly its only problem. You sit beside one of the six Trump-appointed Board members who put you in a position to make these poor decisions.  
 
Mr. Bloom, as the Chairman of the Board of Governors you “exercise the power of the Postal Service,” according to federal law. And despite a series of blundering, half-baked initiatives and evidence that the PMG attempted to influence an election on behalf of his friends in the Trump Administration, you have remained silent. You have failed to hold the PMG accountable for record low performance and operational standards that have crippled the Postal Service. 
 
Not all of these challenges lay at Mr. DeJoy’s feet. There’s enough blame to go around. 
 
So where do we go from here? We have a PMG whose leadership and decisionmaking cannot be trusted, and we have a Board of Governors too meek or too aligned with the previous Administration to hold him accountable. 
 
Luckily, we have a President now who cares about the Postal Service. In his campaign he made the Postal Service is a priority. We have a president who won’t use this nation’s lifeline as a weapon in a proxy war against his imagined foe Jeff Bezos and his Amazon empire. Mr. Biden sees the Postal Service for the connective fabric that it is and he’s ready to take steps to save it.
 
I’m prepared to meet this moment. Congress cannot afford to miss it.
 
 
Please continue to take care of yourselves and each other, and remember that my office is here to help. Be sure to visit the COVID-19 page on my website for more information and resources. If you have any questions or concerns, or if you need assistance, please don't hesitate to call us at (703) 256-3071.

Sen. Rick Scott: Schools Need to Reopen and Our Kids Need to Get Back to School
￼
For nearly a year, Senator Scott has been working to ensure schools can reopen safely and students can get back to school. The science is clear and overwhelming that reopening our schools is safe and necessary for the wellbeing of our students. 
Teachers should be able to receive vaccines, and Senator Scott will work with his colleagues to get vaccines to teachers more quickly. Congress has already allocated $68 billion to ensure to ensure students and teachers have safe, clean and healthy classrooms. Keeping schools closed doesn’t make sense, and it’s hurting our children and America’s poorest families the most. 
Every student deserves the option of in-person learning. Senator Scott is committing to protecting the best interests of our students and ensuring every student has the tools they need to succeed. 
Learn more about how Senator Scott is working to reopen schools below.

Sen. Rick Scott: Dems’ Efforts to Keep Schools Closed is Hurting Our Children

Senators Rick Scott, Marco Rubio and Colleagues Introduce Bill to Get Students Back in School 
Earlier this month, Senator Rick Scott joined Senator Marco Rubio and colleagues in introducing the Put Students First Act of 2021, which would prohibit federal funding to schools that do not provide an in-person learning option by April 30, 2021. 
In January, leading health experts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended that America’s schools should reopen as soon as possible if precautions are taken – namely mask-wearing and social distancing – and that new scientific research provides “a path forward to maintain or return primarily or fully to in-person instructional delivery.""   Senator Rick Scott said, “Health experts, students and parents agree: schools need to reopen and our kids need to get back to school. The only people who don’t want to open schools are Senate Democrats and the teachers unions that fund their campaigns. That’s wrong. Schools can openly safely and every student should have the option of in-person learning.""

James Hogge 231-944-7633


Bergman Joins Bipartisan For Country Caucus

Washington - The For Country Caucus, a group of Military Veterans serving in Congress and dedicated to working together to create a more productive government, announced new leadership and a growing caucus membership for the 117th Congress. A retired Lt. General in the Marine Corps, U.S. Representative Jack Bergman will join the Caucus for the 117th Congress.
“With forty years serving in the United States Marines Corps and earning the rank of Lt. General, Congressman Jack Bergman is the highest-ranking combat Veteran to have ever served in the House of Representatives and I am honored to have him join the For Country Caucus. Rep. Bergman’s vast military experience will be a tremendous asset to our group,” said Republican Co-Chair of the For Country Caucus, Congressman Van Taylor.
“I’m proud to be a member of the bipartisan For Country Caucus. Far too often the strong, bipartisan work done every day in D.C. is drowned out by the noise of partisan bickering. This caucus, comprised of men and women who have served in our Nation’s uniform, will continue to focus on policy to better our communities and country as whole,” said Rep. Bergman.
Congressmen Van Taylor (R-TX-03) and Jared Golden (D-ME-02) will lead the caucus as co-chairs through 2022 as its ranks swell to 25 members. Congressmen Jim Baird (R-IN-04) and Salud Carbajal (D-CA-24) will serve as vice-chairs.
“Serving this country in the military gives you the skills to work as a team with Americans of different backgrounds and beliefs, for a cause greater than yourself,” said co-chairs Van Taylor and Jared Golden. “As co-chairs of the For Country Caucus, we’re honored to lead this bipartisan group of Veterans as we continue to build on the foundation that’s been laid over the past two years. The mission of this caucus — to set aside political differences in the pursuit of policies that will benefit the country — has never been more important, and together we can set that example in Congress.” 
The For Country Caucus is a group of principled military Veteran members who strive to create a Congress that is less polarized, more efficient, and is trusted by Americans. Together, they share a vision of a Congress that is strategic in purpose, focused on action, and where elected officials put our country first. Members of the For Country Caucus seek a Congress where members serve with integrity, civility, and courage.
Members of the 117th Congress For Country Caucus include Representatives Jason Crow (D-CO-06), Don Bacon (R-NE-02), Chrissy Houlahan (D-PA-06), Jack Bergman (R-MI-01), Scott Franklin (R-FL-15), Kai Kahele (D-HI-02), Mike Gallagher (R-WI-08), Mike Garcia (R-CA-25), Conor Lamb (D-PA-17), Tony Gonzales (R-TX-23), Adam Kinzinger (R-IL-16), Elaine Luria (D-VA-02), Brian Mast (R-FL-18), Peter Meijer (R-MI-03), Seth Moulton (D-MA-06), Mariannette Miller Meeks (R-IA-02), Jimmy Panetta (D-CA-20), August Pfluger (R-TX-11), Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ-11), Greg Steube (R-FL-17), and Michael Waltz (R-FL-06).
In the 116th Congress, the For Country Caucus built a strong track record and got results. The caucus and its members successfully worked to pass a number of national service-oriented provisions into law, including:  
	•	Fallen Heroes Family Travel Act (H.R. 3065): Authorized reimbursement to Gold Star families for the costs of transporting fallen servicemembers’ remains to a national cemetery (Became law in FY20 NDAA)
	•	Better Military Housing Act (H.R. 2811): Established a tenant “bill of rights” and sets minimum acceptable livability standards for military personnel and their families (Became law in FY20 NDAA)
	•	Widow’s Tax Repeal (H.R. 553): Phased out the Widow’s Tax (Became Law in FY20 NDAA)
	•	Afghan Allies Protection Act (H.R. 2796): Authorized 4,000 additional visas for Afghan allies and extended the application period to 2021 (Became law in FY20 NDAA)
	•	Full Military Honors Act (H.R. 1019): Authorized full military honors for Veterans who were awarded the Medal of Honor or prisoner-of-war medal (Became law in FY20 NDAA)
	•	Childcare Resources for Surviving Family Members: Expanded financial assistance to civilian providers of childcare services for Gold Star families (Became law in FY20 NDAA)
	•	Meetings of Service Chiefs and Surviving Families: Enacted a requirement for senior military officials to meet with survivors of deceased service members to receive feedback on issues affecting survivors (Became law in FY20 NDAA)
	•	National Suicide Hotline Designation Act (H.R. 4194): Designated 9-8-8 as the universal telephone number for a national suicide prevention and mental health crisis hotline (Became Law)
	•	National Cyber Director Act (H.R. 7331): Established the office of the National Cyber Director within the Executive Office of the President (Became law in FY21 NDAA)
	•	Gold Star Families Park Pass Act (H.R. 5998): Made the National Parks and Federal Recreational Land Pass free to members of Gold Star families (Became law in FY21 NDAA)
	•	Legal Services for Homeless Veterans Act (H.R. 3749): Established grants for entities that provide legal services for homeless Veterans (Became law in H.R. 7105)

2/25/21 16:00,"Baldwin Introduces Bipartisan, Bicameral Bill To Cover K2 Veterans’ Toxic Exposure Care & Benefits","

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
Today, Senator Baldwin and Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) introduced the K2 Veterans Care Act. This legislation would establish a “presumption of service connection” for the veterans who served at Karshi-Khanabad Air Base (K2) in Uzbekistan and who have since been diagnosed with toxic exposure-related illnesses and diseases, requiring the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to provide health care and benefits.  
“The Pentagon has known for years that our U.S. troops were exposed to cancer-causing toxins while serving in Uzbekistan and it’s simply wrong for the VA to deny them health care and disability benefits. The VA has taken a similar approach in the past, delaying recognition and compensation for American veterans exposed to toxic substances like Agent Orange in Vietnam, and with military burn pits in Iraq and Afghanistan, while veterans became sick and died. We can’t let that happen again,” said Senator Baldwin. “Our legislation does right by those who served at K2 and were exposed to health risks. We have a commitment to these troops and we need to keep it.”  ""The K2 Veterans Care Act is critically important to those veterans who volunteered to serve their country and trusted they would be cared for if they were fortunate enough to return from battle or complete their service obligations. Many have suffered after being stationed at K2, and are still suffering, and we greatly appreciate the work that Senator Baldwin is doing to make sure we get the targeted health care we need,"" said Leroy Miller, a K2 Veteran from Wisconsin. 
As many as 15,000 U.S. servicemembers deployed to K2 Air Base—an old Soviet military site leased to the U.S. from the Uzbek government between 2001 and 2005—to support military operations into northern Afghanistan following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Recent media reports and declassified Department of Defense (DOD) documents released by the House Oversight and Reform Committee’s Subcommittee on National Security indicate that K2 servicemembers were exposed to multiple cancer-causing toxic chemicals and radiological hazards during their deployments. These toxins include hazardous petrochemicals, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), depleted uranium, burn pits, and elevated levels of tetrachloroethylene.  According to a September 2004 health assessment, the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive Medicine found that, “the potential for daily contact with radiation exists for up to 100% of the assigned units” at the K2 base. In April 2020, the VA announced that it would study illnesses among K2 veterans including cancers, but results from the study are not expected for at least 18 months.  The K2 Veterans Care Act would create a “presumption of service connection” for illnesses associated with toxic exposures at K2. This presumption of service connection would require the VA to provide health care and disability benefits to any K2 veterans who presents diseases associated with jet fuel, VOCs, particulate matter, depleted uranium, asbestos, and lead-based paint—all of which were toxins found at K2. 
The legislation has also been introduced in the House by U.S. Representatives Stephen F. Lynch (D-MA) and Mark Green (R-TN) and has been endorsed by Wounded Warrior Project, Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), Disabled Veterans of America (DAV), and the Stronghold Freedom Foundation. 
“Many veterans who served at the Karshi Khanabad (K2) base have developed serious health issues due to exposure to toxicants,” said Wounded Warrior Project Vice President of Government Affairs Jose Ramos. “The K2 Veterans Care Act of 2020 will provide these veterans the hospital care, medical services, and nursing home care they need and deserve. We thank Senators Blumenthal and Baldwin for introducing this bill and look forward to working with them to ensure its passage in the Senate.”  “The veterans who deployed to Karshi-Khanabad Air Base (K2) were exposed to dangerous substances while serving our country,” said Director of VFW’s National Legislative Service Pat Murray. “Thousands of troops worked and slept in dangerous conditions every day and they are suffering illnesses because of their service. The VFW supports this proposal and looks forward to its swift passage so our K2 veterans can begin to receive the care and benefits they rightfully deserve.”

Congressman Gosar Reintroduces The Dental Loan Repayment Assistance Act
 
 
WASHINGTON D.C. - Congressman Paul Gosar (AZ-04) issued the following statement after reintroducing H.R. 1285, the Dental Loan Repayment Assistance Act, bipartisan legislation exempting dental faculty loan repayment recipients from taxation for five years.
 
“It is very fitting this legislation be introduced in February, National Children’s Dental Health Month, to promote the benefits of good oral hygiene. Training our next generation of dentists is critical to the overall health of our country,” said Congressman Gosar. “I’m proud to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reintroduce this important legislation that aims to remove barriers and strengthen oral health training,” said Congressman Gosar. 
Joining Congressman Gosar in introducing this bipartisan legislation included Representatives Yvette D. Clarke (D-NY) Mike Simpson, D.M.D. (R-ID) and Grace Meng (D-NY), 
The Dental Loan Repayment Assistance Act exempts Title VII’s dental faculty loan repayment recipients from taxation for five years during the span of their participation in the loan forgiveness program. The bill prevents dental faculty members from paying exorbitant tax bills on their federal loan repayment benefits.
The Dental Faculty Loan Repayment Program (DFLRP) was created to address the significant difficulties in recruiting qualified individuals to fill faculty positions, especially acute in pediatric dentistry. A critical factor in recruiting and retaining dental school faculty from recent dental school or residency program graduates is the staggering student loan debt and income disparity with private practice. “By alleviating taxation of such payments to the individual, this legislation will make the program even more effective in recruiting and retaining pediatric dental faculty,” added Dr. Jessica A. Lee, President of the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry.

2/25/21 16:47,Rep. Adriano Espaillat Votes to Pass Historic Equality Act to End Discrimination Against All LGBTQ Americans,"￼ 
  

PRESS RELEASE
For Immediate Release
February 25, 2021


Rep. Adriano Espaillat Votes to Pass Historic Equality Act to End Discrimination Against All LGBTQ Americans

 WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Rep. Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) voted to pass H.R. 5, the Equality Act, to ensure that all LGBTQ Americans are granted the full protections guaranteed by federal civil rights law.  The Equality Act extends anti-discrimination protections not just in the workplace, but in every place – in employment, education, access to credit, jury service, federal funding, housing and public accommodations.   “For decades, tireless leaders, activists and committed citizens have marched and mobilized to advance progress and secure the promise of equality and justice for the LGBTQ community in New York and across the country” said Rep. Espaillat.  “To build on the progress we have made, I am honored join my colleagues to pass the Equality Act to finally, fully end discrimination against LGBTQ Americans once and for all.  This landmark legislation reaffirms that freedom from discrimination is a fundamental civil right that belongs to every American and that no New Yorker or any American should ever lose their job, their home or be denied access to essential services simply because of who they are or whom they love.”   
￼
 Countless members of the national LGBTQ community still live in states where, though they have the right to marry, they have no explicit, state-level non-discrimination protections in other areas of daily life.  In 27 states, LGBTQ Americans do not have state protections against being denied housing because of their sexual orientation; 31 states lack protections regarding access to education; and 38 states lack protections regarding jury service.  In at least half of the states, a same-sex couple can get married one day and legally denied service at a restaurant or be evicted from their apartment the next.  The Equality Act amends existing federal civil rights laws to create a nationwide standard that explicitly prohibits discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity everywhere.    Despite the Supreme Court’s recent Bostock v. Clayton County decision affirming that LGBTQ Americans are protected from discrimination in the workplace under federal law, the Trump Administration advanced an anti-LGBTQ agenda that undermined the rights of LGBTQ Americans.  In one of its first actions, the Biden-Harris Administration issued an Executive Order directing all federal agencies to fully comply with the Bostock decision, but the Equality Act remains necessary to codify civil rights protections in every arena of life in America and ensure that future administrations cannot reinterpret the Supreme Court ruling or deny LGBTQ individuals their full rights and protections.    The Equality Act enjoys the overwhelming support of the American people – 70 percent of whom favor the legislation’s vital protections – as well as robust support from the business community, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and hundreds of leading businesses and corporations that recognize that the strength of our economy and our society requires equal protection under the law.  “In New York, our communities are blessed and strengthened by the beauty and diversity of our LGBTQ friends and neighbors,” continued Rep. Espaillat. “As we take this momentous step forward, we must reaffirm the fundamental truth: that all are created equal and are deserving of dignity, respect and civil rights in America.  As this vital legislation heads to the Democratic Senate, I am committed to keep fighting until the Equality Act is finally signed into law.”

Representative Espaillat is the first Dominican American to serve in the U.S. House of Representatives and his congressional district includes Harlem, East Harlem, West Harlem, Hamilton Heights, Washington Heights, Inwood, Marble Hill and the north-west Bronx. First elected to Congress in 2016, Representative Espaillat is serving his third term in Congress.

Rep. Adriano Espaillat vota para aprobar la histórica Ley de Igualdad para poner fin a la discriminación contra todos los estadounidenses LGBTQ


WASHINGTON, DC – Hoy, el congresista Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) votó para aprobar la H.R. 5, la Ley de Igualdad (Equality Act), a los fines de garantizar que todos los estadounidenses LGBTQ reciban la protección total garantizada por la ley federal de derechos civiles. La Ley de Igualdad extiende las protecciones contra la discriminación no solo en el lugar de trabajo, sino en todos los lugares: empleo, educación, acceso al crédito, servicio de jurado, fondos federales, vivienda y alojamientos públicos.

“Durante décadas, líderes incansables, activistas y ciudadanos comprometidos han marchado y se han movilizado para avanzar en el progreso alcanzado y asegurar la promesa de igualdad y justicia para la comunidad LGBTQ en Nueva York y en todo el país”, dijo el Rep. Espaillat. “Para aprovechar el progreso que hemos logrado, me siento honrado de unirme a mis colegas para aprobar la Ley de Igualdad y, finalmente, terminar por completo con la discriminación contra los estadounidenses LGBTQ de una vez por todas. Esta legislación histórica reafirma que la no discriminación es un derecho civil fundamental que pertenece a todos los estadounidenses y que ningún neoyorquino o estadounidense debe perder su trabajo, su vivienda o que se le niegue el acceso a servicios esenciales simplemente por ser quiénes son o por la persona a quien prefieren amar"".

Innumerables miembros de la comunidad LGBTQ nacional todavía viven en estados donde, aunque tienen derecho a casarse, no tienen protecciones explícitas contra la discriminación a nivel estatal en otras áreas de la vida diaria. En 27 estados, los estadounidenses LGBTQ no tienen protecciones estatales contra que se les niegue una vivienda debido a su orientación sexual; 31 estados carecen de protección con respecto al acceso a la educación; y 38 estados carecen de protección con respecto al servicio de jurado. En al menos la mitad de los estados, una pareja del mismo sexo puede casarse un día y se le puede negar legalmente el servicio en un restaurante o ser desalojada de su apartamento al día siguiente. La Ley de Igualdad enmienda las leyes federales de derechos civiles existentes para crear un estándar nacional que prohíbe explícitamente la discriminación por motivos de orientación sexual e identidad de género en todas partes.

A pesar de la reciente decisión de la Corte Suprema en el caso Bostock v. Condado de Clayton que afirma que los estadounidenses LGBTQ están protegidos contra la discriminación en el lugar de trabajo bajo la ley federal, la Administración Trump avanzó una agenda anti-LGBTQ que socavó los derechos de los estadounidenses LGBTQ. En una de sus primeras acciones, la Administración Biden-Harris emitió una Orden Ejecutiva que ordena a todas las agencias federales que cumplan plenamente con la decisión emitida en el caso Bostock, pero la Ley de Igualdad sigue siendo necesaria para codificar las protecciones de los derechos civiles en todos los ámbitos de la vida en Estados Unidos y garantizar que en el futuro las administraciones no puedan reinterpretar el fallo de la Corte Suprema ni negar a las personas LGBTQ todos sus derechos y protecciones.

La Ley de Igualdad cuenta con el apoyo abrumador del pueblo estadounidense –el 70 por ciento de los cuales está a favor de las protecciones vitales de la legislación–, así como con el apoyo sólido de la comunidad empresarial, incluida la Cámara de Comercio de los EE.UU. y cientos de empresas y corporaciones líderes que reconocen que la fuerza de nuestra economía y nuestra sociedad requiere igual protección para todos ante la ley.

“En Nueva York, nuestras comunidades son bendecidas y fortalecidas por la belleza y diversidad de nuestros amigos y vecinos LGBTQ”, agregó el Rep. Espaillat. “Mientras damos este paso trascendental, debemos reafirmar una verdad fundamental: que todos fueron creados iguales y merecen dignidad, respeto y derechos civiles en los Estados Unidos. Mientras esta legislación vital pasa al Senado Demócrata para su aprobación, me comprometo a seguir luchando hasta que finalmente se promulgue la Ley de Igualdad"".

Rep. Gohmert: Dem’s Equality Act is “All About Power,” Eviscerates First Amendment
 
Rep. Louie Gohmert (TX-01) spoke today at a House Freedom Caucus press conference and on the House Floor and warned of the dangers of the Democrats’ radical Equality Act (H.R.5):
“You don’t have to take our word for it. Let me just read this from page 25 of the bill: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 shall not provide a claim concerning, or a defense to a claim under, a covered title, or provide a basis for challenging the application or enforcement of a covered title,” said the Congressman at the press conference. “What’s worse: it doesn’t mention what it eviscerates really, and that is the First Amendment.”
Watch the Congressman's full comments at the press conference HERE.
During today's floor debate in consideration of H.R.5, Rep. Gohmert said,  “What this bill, the so-called Equality Act is really about, it’s not about giving rights, this is about taking away rights. This is saying, that part of the First Amendment which states ‘Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof;’ that’s gotta go!”

 Let parents, not teachers, decide when children go back to school           Candidate Joe Biden promised to “follow the science” regarding COVID-19 and to open up schools nationwide. That was a rational promise because, for almost a year, the science has been clear that children were at lower risk both to catch and transmit the virus. For almost as long, we have been aware that children and adolescents were at extreme risk for other maladies caused by social isolation and mass expulsions from school.  President Biden, in his best imitation of the truth minister from 1984, has deemed that in-person school for one day a week, even if it is not a full day, means schools are “opened up.” Darn the science, full speed ahead on the lockdowns. And full speed ahead at kowtowing to the teachers unions that provided ample funding to candidate Biden.  The science worldwide is constant and clear: Children need to be in school. They are safe in school. Schools should be open — and open now.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has done a great job frustrating the control freaks and alarmists on the Left. He has held the position that parents should make the choice of whether their child should return to in-person education. Every child in Florida has the opportunity to attend school in-person, full-time.  And that is the way it ought to be everywhere in the nation.  The Left disagrees. It wants to continue to perpetuate fear and alarm so that it can control people. It would rather control people than let them govern themselves, assess risk, and choose how they want to respond to the risk.  The Left disagrees with the science. It claims to be following the science but ignores the data that support in-person learning for children. It disregards the increased suicides and mental illness in adolescents and young adults who are victimized by these lockdowns.  The Left disagrees with the DeSantis approach. In Florida, high school sports continue to happen — boys playing football, girls playing volleyball, etc. Children are continuing to learn by attending school. Families are living pre-pandemic-like lives, making judgments on how to respond to best accommodate the risk.  In the meantime, the vast majority of children in America have gone almost a year without in-person learning. Experts warn of the effects of this delay. It isn’t that they will simply be a year behind, but that their learning will be harmed.  Teachers unions, the latest example coming from Chicago, continue to show that they may be one of the biggest enemies to educating our children. They have lobbied to stay closed. They have proposed absurdities such as bringing the children to school to have the students sit in classrooms with an adult monitor, while the teacher stays home to “teach” remotely.  Apparently, some teachers unions believe that in-person learning is not necessary. The science and data simply do not support the position that so many school boards and unions have taken.  Parents need to continue to demand in-person education. State legislatures need to use funding as a lever to get schools open, as does Congress. And Biden needs to honor the promise he made to the parents and students of America.

2/25/21 17:28,February Updates from DC and the District,"￼ 
  

Good afternoon. I would like to provide a few updates about recent developments in Congress and share some important information.
Stop CHEATERS Act
I recently introduced the Stop Corporations and Higher Earners from Avoiding Taxes and Enforce Rules Strictly (“Stop CHEATERS Act”) to focus more tax enforcement on the ultra-rich. It is long past time we stop allowing corporations and high-income earners to avoid paying the taxes they owe. They need to pay taxes like ordinary hard-working Americans do.
Without raising taxes on anyone, the Stop CHEATERS Act would raise an estimated $1.2 trillion in revenue over ten years by investing $100 billion in IRS enforcement over the next decade. That money would expand auditing and reporting requirements to prevent tax cheating from the wealthiest corporations and individuals. This bill does not impose new requirements on small business owners, who would continue to prepare and pay their taxes as usual.
The Stop CHEATERS Act will make America’s tax system fairer by giving the IRS the resources it needs to put an end to runaway tax evasion by the ultra-rich and the wealthiest corporations in the U.S.
Chair of the Subcommittee on the Environment
I am pleased to announce that I am the new chair of the House Oversight and Reform Subcommittee on Environment for the 117th Congress. My priorities will be to fight both climate change and climate disinformation, create green jobs and protect communities left behind from the detrimental effects of climate change, and end fossil fuel subsidies.
I envision a nation that works towards 100 percent clean energy, low emissions, and communities with good quality sustainable employment. I will use my new leadership role to do everything I can to make our vision a reality.
Single Dose of COVID-19 Vaccine
I sent a letter to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky and White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Jeffrey Zients, urging them to consider a one-dose vaccination regimen to rapidly scale up the number of vaccinations administered in the United States. A new study out of the UK found that one dose of the vaccine reduced the risk of infection by 72 percent after three weeks. If clinical data supports an effective one-dose vaccine regimen, it could nearly double our daily vaccination numbers, simplify administration, and reduce COVID-19 deaths in the long run.
District Section
As the Administration works to expand production and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine, our goal is to ensure that every American receives it as soon as possible in order to save lives and bring an end to the pandemic. Please refer to these important links regarding vaccine distribution:

Our District Office continues to prioritize constituent services and federal agency casework. We are hopeful that the Biden administration will be more amenable to expediting visa processing wait times and removing various administrative hurdles placed by the Trump administration. Earlier this month, our office resumed expedited requests to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services for certain visa types. We are monitoring the situation closely and will continue to press for expedited processing times if delays continue to place burdens on the immigrant visa holders of our district.

2/25/21 18:25,The Inequality Act,"
￼ 
The Inequality Act
Dear Friends,
This week, House Democrats unveiled one of the most toxic and misguided parts of their legislative agenda: the so-called “Equality Act.”
The Left claims the “Equality Act” will protect LGBTQ Americans from discrimination by adding sexual orientation and gender identity to the traits and characteristics protected under the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
Unfortunately, this legislation is so misguided and poorly constructed that its unintended consequences boggle the mind. It’s no exaggeration to say that this bill will upend American society as we know it.
The problem with this legislation boils down to how it defines “gender identity.” Keep in mind; we’re not talking about gender. It’s already illegal to discriminate against someone based on their gender. For that matter, following a June 2020 Supreme Court ruling, it’s also already unlawful to discriminate against someone based on their sexual orientation or gender identity.
The “Equality Act” is not about fighting discrimination. Its real aim is to force all American society to conform to the radical Left’s extremist views of the world.
Democrats are attempting to use the power of law to erase the age-old definition of gender as male and female. Instead, legislate a new definition based on a person’s perception of his or herself – not the actual chromosomal DNA that sets gender.
This legislation would force all schools and businesses to open their female showers, restrooms, sports teams, etc., to men who say they identify as women and vice versa. It would force all employers to pay for gender reassignment surgeries in their health insurance plans – and force all health care workers to perform them, regardless of their religious beliefs. It would force the military to accept applicants suffering from gender dysmorphia even if they are not combat-capable. It would force faith-based adoption agencies to violate their conviction that every child deserves a mother and a father or stop serving the community altogether.
Make no mistake: The so-called “Equality Act” is fundamentally anti-woman. It recreates society so that women and girls are no longer protected or even recognized as uniquely female. In the workforce, sports world, classrooms, or any public spaces, any biological man classifying himself as a woman according to his self-perceived “gender identity” would have every claim to any woman’s program, scholarship, sports team, competition, employment opportunity, women’s shelter, locker room, and so on.
For example, any privacy and safety precautions in women’s shelters would be thrown aside when a man claiming to be a woman demands entry. Similarly, the privacy protections for girls in school bathrooms and locker rooms would be completely erased. Any man could show up and automatically be allowed to join any women’s sports team – and the coaches or parents cannot even ask whether the man is currently on hormone therapy or else that would be a violation of his human rights. In one fell swoop, Democrats would destroy all-female sports!
The bill is also fundamentally anti-science. Redefining “gender” in federal law based around gender perceptions denies the scientific fact that a male, no matter how many hormonal injections or surgical alterations, can never become a female, menstruate, or bear children. The “Equality Act” completely denies both science and commonsense.
Be assured that I’m committed to fighting against this outrageous legislation every step of the way! Unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi has already rushed the “Equality Act” through the House of Representatives. It passed this afternoon by a vote of 224-206. Now that Democrats control Washington, we must hope and pray that President Biden and the Senate wake up to this insanity and stop this bill before it becomes the law of the land!

10th Congressional District Vaccination Sites
The Georgia Department of Health and Governor Brian Kemp are working tirelessly to administer as many vaccines as possible to eligible citizens. Right now, Georgia is in Phase 1a+, meaning that anyone 65 years of age and older as well as their caregivers, long-term care facility residents and staff, healthcare personnel, and emergency first responders all qualify to receive the vaccine. If you don’t currently qualify for the vaccine, or you are unsure if you qualify, you can sign up to receive updates on Georgia’s vaccine distribution phase here. You can see a full list of distribution sites that are located in our district here. I highly recommend calling ahead to ensure that the location is open, and an appointment is available. And remember, new vaccine distribution sites are being added frequently and can be found here.
*Please Note: If your county is not found on this list, that means there are no vaccination sites in your county, but you are encouraged to reach out to vaccination sites in neighboring counties. All times are subject to change at the discretion of each location.

Celebrating Black History Month & 60 Years of Desegregation at UGA 
As in so much of the South, Georgia had a long and often difficult path towards ensuring all Americans, regardless of race, receive equal treatment and protection in society. During Black History Month, it’s important to look back at one critical step of that journey and honoring those with the courage to enact change in our congressional district.
As one of the first universities in Georgia to integrate in 1961, the University of Georgia has become an exemplary leader in honoring and remembering the impact made by its first African American students who fought for integration. Hamilton Holmes, Charlayne Hunter, and Mary Frances Early made a historic impact on UGA and Athens as a whole by fighting for their place to learn alongside their peers. Holmes and Hunter were part of a landmark court case in January 1961 that ended 160 years of segregation at the university by allowing the two students to be admitted. Early graduated in 1962, receiving her master’s degree in music education and becoming the first African-American to receive a degree from UGA, and Holmes and Hunter followed a year later in 1963.
I’m proud to see UGA celebrating the giant impact these pioneers had on bringing diversity to our district 60 years later during Black History Month. If you’d like to learn more about Holmes, Hunter, and Early, you can view a fantastic video put together by the UGA Alumni group here. To read more about the desegregation fight in Georgia’s university system, you can visit the New Georgia Encyclopedia here.

District Recap
On Thursday, I had the privilege to meet with a several 10th District residents in my new Greensboro office regarding a variety of issues, including resources for our food banks, election security, and the national debt. One of the people who I had the privilege of meeting with was Toby Dalton, Chairman of the First Call Pregnancy Center of Greensboro. Toby, thanks for stopping by. I am incredibly thankful for the passion and dedication of the citizens of the 10th District.

￼

After a busy day in the office, I headed down to Columbia County where I spent the evening at the Clubhouse at Jones Creek with the Faith and Freedom Coalition of the CSRA. With a crowd of about 60 people present, I was honored to join Congressman Rick Allen in presenting a flag that flew over the United States Capitol to the group’s founder and first president, Rose Cales.

￼

Afterwards, I shared an encouraging message challenging people of faith to engage and impact our communities. To quote President George Washington in his farewell address, “Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, Religion and morality are indispensable supports.” Thank you, Susie Welsh, for inviting me to speak. My wife, Dee Dee, and I enjoyed the evening!

Dear Lindsey,
 
Nearly a year ago, kitchen tables turned into classrooms as concerns about the coronavirus pandemic led to schools closing.  
Educators quickly shifted to teaching lessons virtually and parents worked to keep their kids engaged and active.  
Unfortunately, being away from friends, classmates, and daily routines for an extended period of time is hurting students. Prolonged remote learning is putting kids at risk of falling behind, failing classes, and suffering from mental health problems. For students with disabilities, minorities, and those in underserved areas, that risk is even greater.  
Throughout his campaign, President Biden repeatedly said he would listen to scientists and health experts when it came to tackling the pandemic.    
Here’s what scientists are saying about getting kids back in their classrooms:  
Dr. Rochelle Walensky, President Biden’s own CDC director, said earlier this month that there was “increasing data that schools can safely reopen” even if teachers haven’t received a COVID-19 vaccine.  
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said “I would back the CDC recommendations because that is really based on data … we need to try and get the children back to school.”  
Dr. David Rosen, assistant professor of pediatric infectious diseases at Washington University in St. Louis, said, “There is no situation in which schools can’t be open unless they have evidence of in-school transmission.”  
But instead of “following the science” as he often said he would – President Biden is ignoring it.  
Recently, I offered an amendment to the budget bill that would have incentivized school districts to get kids back into school after teachers have been vaccinated. Those vaccines are even a step beyond what the CDC says is necessary.  
Every single Senate Democrat voted against it.  
That vote made one thing very clear: this isn’t about safety, and it’s not about science; it’s pure politics, and kids are paying the price.  
We need to put students first. We need to do what’s best for their education and well-being while taking steps to ensure their safety.  
As a former high school history teacher and university president, I know that educators overcome challenges every day. Teachers want to help kids learn, and they know that won’t happen again until students are back at their desks. We must reopen schools now.
 
Sincere regards, 
￼

Dear Lindsey,
 
The House of Representatives just passed the Equality Act, a groundbreaking bill to help ensure that LGBTQ Americans are finally granted the full protections guaranteed by federal civil rights law.
 
This is a big deal, and I am so proud to have voted yes on this important law. While Massachusetts has worked hard to prevent discrimination and protect the rights of all our citizens, the sad reality is that in most other states, anyone can be denied housing, education, credit, or the chance to serve on a jury because of their sexual orientation or gender identity.
 
In 27 states, LGBTQ Americans do not have protections against being denied housing because of their sexual orientation; 31 states lack protections regarding access to education; and 38 states lack protections regarding jury service. In at least half of the states, a same-sex couple can get married one day and legally denied service at a restaurant or be evicted from their apartment the next.
 
That is just plain wrong. In the United States of America, nobody should be discriminated against because of who they are. And the Equality Act will help us make things right.
 
I spoke on the House Floor to urge all of my colleagues to vote yes. You can watch my remarks here:
 
 
￼
 
 
The Equality Act enjoys the overwhelming support of the American people – 70 percent of whom favor the legislation’s vital protections – as well as robust support from the business community, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and hundreds of leading businesses that recognize that the strength of our economy and our society requires equal protection under the law.
 
As we take this important step forward, we reaffirm the fundamental truth: that all of us were created equal and are deserving of the same dignity, respect, and civil rights. That the words we pledge to the flag of the United States—with liberty and justice for all—really mean for all, and not just for some.
 
As this landmark legislation heads to the Democratic Senate, I am committed to working until the Equality Act is signed into law by President Biden as soon as possible.
 
Sincerely,

￼

Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene Sponsors Amendment to Remove America’s Children From The Democrats' Hostage Grip And Put Them Back In School

Washington D.C. – Today, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene continues to work to reopen schools and ensure taxpayer dollars spent on education go to parents and students by sponsoring the Funds Follow Students Amendment to the Blue State Bailout. 
 
The Funds Follow Students Amendment:

	•	Allows federal funds for K-12 education to follow the eligible child, regardless of whether the child is in public school, private school, or homeschool.
	•	Allows certain funds under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to follow a child, whether learning in person or remotely, to the public school, private school, or homeschool of choice.
	•	Can be used on a range of needs including, tuition, educational materials such as curriculum or technological materials, tutoring, extracurricular activities, and educational therapies for students with disabilities.
 
Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene issued the following statement:
 
“It's past time to reopen America's schools and STOP the insane policies that are destroying the development of our nation's kids.
 
This amendment would enact the SCHOOL ACT, introduced by Rep. Chip Roy, to ensure that your hard-earned tax dollars spent in the Blue State Bailout are spent this year and the money goes to parents and students, not teacher’s unions and schools that refuse to reopen. 
 
Schools that refuse to reopen should receive no federal funding! This should not be a political issue. Our children need to go back to school. The Democrats need to stop holding our children hostage.
 
Congress must put our children first!”

Congressman Chip Roy (TX-21) joins Congresswoman Greene as a cosponsor to the Funds Follow Students Amendment.

2/25/21 21:01,Protecting Free Speech for all Americans,"
 

Freedom of speech is unique to us as Americans, and it has been fought for and defended all through our history. Elected officials using their platform to pressure private companies to censor media outlets they disagree with is deeply troubling and sounds a lot like actions from the Chinese Communist Party. 

Now more than ever, we need to uphold the First Amendment, which states that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.” 
 

Freedom of speech is foundational to our personal rights and liberties. We should all be troubled when duly-elected representatives launch an attack on the First Amendment to coerce private companies to censor political speech.  

Instead, let’s give people hope in the Promise of America again—so they have the courage to be unique, creative, and live their lives without fear. We should all be publicly denouncing this censorship campaign on news that doesn’t fit a specific worldview. 

Click here to watch how I fought back this week. 
 
 

	•	Helping you get a COVID-19 vaccine – This week, I took to the Energy & Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations to highlight the shortcomings of Washington State’s vaccine distribution strategy. The Washington Department of Health ignored basic logistics in their rollout plan, and Governor Inslee threatened to withhold vaccines from Whitman County if health officials began vaccinating teachers, despite the swift and efficient vaccination of all other eligible people. This one-size-fits-all approach is misguided, and it is hurting Eastern Washington. 
	•	Protecting your right to free speech – Yesterday, Democrats launched an attack on Americans’ right to free speech by trying to censor media outlets they disagree with. This sets a dangerous precedent, which is why I am fighting to uphold the First Amendment that is foundational to our way of life. Click here to watch. 
	•	Upholding our way of life – This week, I had a virtual meeting with the Washington State Potato Commission to discuss the importance of the Lower Snake River dams to our farmers. We also discussed my priorities as Lead Republican on the Energy & Commerce Committee to close the digital divide and make sure farmers can continue to make positive environmental impacts. 
 
 

Last week, I asked you if you supported expanding financial opportunity for the millions of Americans living with a disability. The results are in, and only 16% of you who responded thought that Americans with a disability did not need to save. Like the vast majority of you, I believe that every American - regardless of their abilities - has the right to save for their future! 

This week, I introduced the ABLE Age Adjustment Act to build on the incredible progress we’ve made to empower people with disabilities to live fuller and more independent lives. This important legislation will expand access to tax-free ABLE accounts for people who develop a disability later in life – as late as 46 years old – so they can invest in their education, pay for medical expenses, and look for a job.  

ABLE puts our focus on every person’s abilities and God-given talents, not their limitations. Additionally, the ABLE Age Adjustment Act will help us continue to close the gap between Americans with disabilities looking for a job and the small fraction who actually find one.  

There is more work to be done to build on the legacy of the ABLE Act, but I’m confident this is a great step that will empower more people to live with dignity and reach their potential. 
 

The First Amendment guarantees that “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press.” Do you support censoring media outlets? 
Select one:
Yes, free speech is dangerous.
Select
 
No, free speech is a fundamental American right.
Select
 
Unsure or undecided.

I’m excited to announce that my office is now accepting submissions for the 2021 Congressional Art Competition. This is a great tradition that gives students in grades 7-12 an opportunity to highlight their artistic talents, and the winner will have their piece displayed in the U.S. Capitol. The application deadline is April 23, so I hope you’ll consider submitting your piece! 
 

Q: Why can’t K-12 students go back to school full-time immediately? - Judy from Spokane 

Thank you for your question. This is an issue I feel very strongly about. As a working mom of three, I understand the struggles that so many parents in our community are going through right now.  

I recently heard from a number of families in Eastern Washington who are struggling with their mental health as a result of schools being closed and extracurricular activities being canceled.  

Virtual school isn’t working. Our kids are falling behind in the classroom. We have allowed our children to feel neglected and ignored, and I am deeply concerned about their well-being, especially their mental health. 

The isolation has taken a toll on our children, and we are seeing a steep increase in depression, anxiety, drug abuse, and even suicide attempts. As your representative, and more importantly as a mom, I am heartbroken over what this pandemic has done to our children. 

That’s why I continue to encourage President Biden to follow the science and reopen schools across the country immediately. Additionally, for the health of our kids, we must come together in a bipartisan way to provide relief that ensures our kids are back in school, people are back to work, and everyone who wants and needs a vaccine gets one. 

To all of the families who are struggling with this, please know that you are not forgotten, and I stand by each and every one of you in this fight. 

What question would you like to see answered next week?
Submit a Question
 
 

Earlier this month, I received this letter from the Washington Grain Commission in Spokane thanking me for protecting the Lower Snake River Dams. In all of my years serving in Congress, this was one of the most thoughtful letters I have ever received. I agree, “Friends are God’s way of taking care of us,” and I am grateful to each and every person in our community who joins me in these important fights. God bless you!

Immigration Updates
 
  
In my role as Chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Border Security, I went to San Ysidro, the Port of Entry between San Diego and Tijuana on Monday. I was briefed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials and witnessed the first steps in phasing out the cruel and inhumane MPP or “Remain in Mexico” policy. I oversaw the arrival of migrants and their processing for entry and met with asylum seekers in the MPP program. I was able to see the challenges and success of the new process, including challenges registering eligible migrants which limits the number of migrants processed each day. Many of these migrants have waited for years in deplorable conditions to legally enter the U.S. to have their asylum cases heard. It was emotional to witness this long awaited day for many.
  
￼
￼
  
We need an immigration system that is fair and humane while providing immigrants who have lived in the United States a pathway to citizenship. That’s why I’m proud to support the US Citizenship Act. The bill, introduced this past Thursday, is  a comprehensive immigration bill that will provide an opportunity to earn citizenship to the hardworking people who enrich our communities every day and who have lived here for years (in some cases for decades).
  
 
Black History Month
 
  
￼
  
A Conversation with Clean Air Champions
 
It was great to chat with constituents and environmental activists Jackie Badejo and Linda Cleveland of the Watts Clean Air & Energy Committee on Facebook Live. We talked environmental justice, community organizing, and pathways for healthier communities.
  
Recognizing PFC James Anderson Jr.
 
This Black History Month, it's an honor to reintroduce a bill to rename a Compton Post Office after the first African-American Marine to receive the Medal of Honor, Private First Class James Anderson, Jr., a patriot and a hero in the purest sense.

On February 28, 1967, while on patrol outside of a village in Quang Tri Province, PFC Anderson's platoon was ambushed and a grenade landed near PFC Anderson and his fellow Marines. Without hesitation, PFC Anderson absorbed the majority of the blast with his body, heroically saving the lives of the Marines around him at the cost of his own. PFC Anderson made the ultimate sacrifice for his  country and his fellow soldiers. Renaming the post office would honor his memory and be a reminder to the community he grew up in of his selfless sacrifice.

Updates from Washington, D.C.
 
  
I'm back in D.C. this week to help push forward another critical coronavirus relief package to help constituents stay healthy and make ends meet. After work in committees, the House will now consider the President's American Rescue Plan, a landmark, life-saving legislation which we hope will be passed into law before unemployment benefits expire.
 

The President’s American Rescue Plan will help us return children safely to the classroom, get vaccines to everyone, put dollars into families’ pockets and put people back to work. More information here.
 
This week has two Homeland Security Committee hearings scheduled on the pandemic response one year later and cybersecurity.  Our last one this week if Friday, please tune in if you're interested.
 
On Friday, the House of Representatives will consider a major public lands conservation package of bills, which includes my Outdoors for All Act legislation.
 
The Outdoors for All Act supports funding for urban parks in underserved communities by establishing in law the Outdoor Recreation Legacy Partnership (ORLP) program, which makes critical investments in urban parks. Only two weeks ago, I successfully led the fight to save the program from being eliminated. Ensuring the continuation of the ORLP program is important for the 44th district and in Los Angeles County, where low income communities and communities of color lack equal access to local parks.

2/26/21 8:12,Medicare-X: A Pathway to Universal Health Coverage through a Public Option,"￼
Dear friend,
Expanding access to affordable health insurance options has long been a priority of mine, and the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated it's past time for the U.S. to significantly improve our health care system. With widespread job losses, exacerbated health disparities, and increasing health care costs, Congress has an urgent duty to expand access to high-quality, affordable care.
That's why this week, Senator Michael Bennet and I reintroduced the Medicare-X Choice Act, comprehensive legislation that would build on the Affordable Care Act to help millions more Americans, especially those in rural communities, access health care coverage while drastically reducing our health care costs.
The ACA expanded health insurance to an additional 20 million Americans. However, many Virginians still face high health care costs and limited options for affordable health insurance. Currently, there are 53 counties and independent cities in the Commonwealth that still have only one health insurer offering coverage on the exchange.
Medicare-X would build on the Medicare framework by establishing the Medicare Exchange (Medicare-X) Health Plan, a public option for uninsured individuals, families, and small businesses. People could then could compare the option with existing private plans when choosing their insurance.
Here's more on how our new Medicare-X legislation would help expand affordable health coverage:
• The public option would first be sold on the individual exchange in areas where there is a shortage of insurers or higher health care costs due to less competition, including rural communities, across Virginia. By 2025, the plan would expand to every ZIP code in the country.
• It would expand Medicare's network of doctors and providers and guarantee the essential health benefits established in the ACA, such as maternity care and mental health services.
• It would ensure access to affordable prescription drugs by empowering the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate drug prices for the new Medicare-X plans and the Medicare Part D program.
• It would fix the ""family glitch"" in the ACA, making 2 to 6 million more Americans eligible for tax credits.
As we continue to combat one of the most devastating public health emergencies in the last century, we must pass this legislation to offer more Americans more quality, affordable health insurance choices and help them get the care they need. I'm committed to pushing forward on this next big step forward to make sure no Virginian - or American - is left behind in health care coverage moving forward.
Sincerely,
￼

Malliotakis Introduces Resident Toll Commuter Relief Act
﻿
Malliotakis' first bill corrects predecessor's bad deal by ensuring that extra revenue derived from two-way tolling is given back to toll payers who reside on either side of the toll bridge
 

(WASHINGTON, DC) - Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis (NY-11) today introduced her first bill, H.R.1356, the Resident Toll Commuter Relief Act, legislation that requires the extra revenue generated by moving from one-way tolling to two-way tolling, to be used to lower tolls or fund rebates and credits for individuals residing on landmasses on either side of the bridge. Applicable to the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, this would provide a reduced toll to the residents of Staten Island and Brooklyn.  
 
""My predecessor was in a position to negotiate a fair deal for us, but instead chose to let the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) pocket the extra revenue from going to two-way tolling, which is estimated to be $12 to 15 million,"" said Congresswoman Nicole Malliotakis. ""My act rights the wrong of my predecessor's bad deal and simply returns extra revenue to the toll payers in our community. This is something that should have been negotiated by Rep. Max Rose to avoid putting more of a toll burden on our residents. At the time, I said that the money should be going back to the citizens, not to into the MTA's black hole."" 
 
In 2019, language inserted into the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act by former Congressman Max Rose repealed language that banned two-way tolling on any bridge connecting the boroughs of Brooklyn and Staten Island. Currently, the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge has the second most expensive round trip bridge toll in the United States.
 
Malliotakis added: ""I believe there was little to no benefit in moving to two-way tolling on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. The MTA's own study showed a 0.1 mph increase in traffic flow, and any reduction in vehicles during the morning commute is gained in the evening. The only true benefit for our community would be returning the extra revenue back to residents in the form of a toll reduction.”

      Boozman Bulletin: This Week in the Senate
 The Senate confirmed Tom Vilsack to serve as U.S. Secretary of Agriculture. Secretary Vilsack has a track record of working with Congress, and the strong bipartisan vote expresses the Senate’s confidence that he will continue that approach moving forward. Congress and the administration must work together to address the many pressing matters facing the ag community and rural America, particularly the need to provide swift relief to those affected by the ongoing pandemic. Building a good relationship with Secretary Vilsack will help us achieve our mutual goals while ensuring that the needs of farmers and ranchers are always at the forefront of USDA’s agenda. I spoke on the Senate floor in support of Secretary Vilsack’s confirmation. 
￼
 I’m proud to serve as the top Republican on the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry this Congress. The committee has a well-deserved reputation as being among the most bipartisan on Capitol Hill. It is a place where committee members actually sit down around a table, hash out our differences and create policy that is good for American agriculture. I am confident this trend will continue as Chairwoman Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) and I work together to address the many challenges our agricultural producers face. My focus will be on efforts to address the impact of the pandemic, grow the farm economy, modernize important nutrition programs and expand opportunities across rural America. Read what Arkansans have to say about what my new role means to our state’s ag community.  

Follow Arkansas’s Lead & Reopen Schools   The Natural State can be proud of the teachers, administrators and elected leaders who continue finding ways to keep schools open and providing critical services children need. It’s time that students in other states have the same opportunities. In a speech on the Senate floor, I explained how Arkansas educators thought creatively and used federal COVID-19 relief aid to invest in cleaning supplies, barriers and retrofitted classrooms. Communities across the state faced different challenges, but Arkansas schools united under one goal: finding the best and safest way to get and keep children and teachers in the classroom.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) research recommends schools reopen. Earlier this month, the CDC issued new guidance to help schools safely open for in-person learning. While President Joe Biden pledged to reopen schools within his first 100 days in office, the administration is now backing away from the original goal. Getting students back in the classroom must be a priority.  

Protecting Health Care Workers from Discrimination 
This week I helped reintroduce the Conscience Protection Act to protect health care providers, including health insurance plans, from government discrimination if they decline to participate in abortions. The legislation also provides a private right of action for victims of discrimination. 
Our conscience rights are one of the most fundamental aspects in our society and democracy. Protecting the ability of health care workers to decline to violate their own deeply-held religious beliefs and convictions is absolutely necessary. I’m proud to join my colleagues in introducing this legislation that safeguards that option and provides opportunities for those discriminated against to receive their due process, including private legal action.
I will continue to advocate for policies that protect religious liberties and support legislation that promotes the value of life. 

Celebrating Black History Month 
February is Black History Month—a time to reflect on the influence of African Americans in our history and celebrate their achievements and contributions to the fabric of our nation. We commemorate the heroes of the African American community who fought injustice and triumphed in the face of adversity.   We honor individuals like the 16 Arkansans who served in the historic 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, the first and only all-female, all-black battalion to be deployed overseas during WWII. The Women’s Army Corps launched the Six Triple Eight in November 1944 with more than 850 personnel assigned to sort the logjam of mail in the European Theater. We should all be inspired by the courage, determination and willingness of these women to serve our country, and in a uniquely special and necessary role. This week I cosponsored legislation to award the unit the Congressional Gold Medal. Such recognition would be a fitting tribute to commemorate the legacy of these trailblazing Americans and the role they played in our history.   
￼
 We continue to honor those who served their country in uniform. In the ‘Salute to Veterans’ series that honors Arkansas veterans, we featured the late Benjamin Haymon, a WWII veteran who served in the Pacific Theater. At the age of 31, he was considerably older than many of his brothers in arms when he was drafted in 1941. When Mr. Haymon passed away in 2019, he was the oldest known WWII veteran in our state. 

Constituent Corner   My staff and I remain committed to doing all we can to help during these challenging times. While some federal agencies are struggling to meet the changing demands of their services during the pandemic, we continue to get answers for Arkansans. 
￼
I am pleased my office was able to help Marecia navigate the Social Security process when she was having trouble getting updates on the status of her claim. The COVID-19 emergency has made communicating with many government agencies more difficult and I am happy we could help her bridge the gap. Let us help you. 

Connecting on Social Media 
Stay up to date with what I’m doing for Arkansans via social media. You can find me on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

2/26/21 10:22,Take My Survey on the Pandemic Relief Package," 

 
Dear Lindsey,

The past year has been very challenging for our nation and for many of our neighbors. We have provided 5 bipartisan relief packages to help small businesses and individuals. There is still $1 trillion in unspent federal funding from the first 5 packages. While I believe more relief might be needed in some areas, we have an obligation to look at what is working, what is not and where the unmet needs are. Wanting transparency and accountability for how your tax dollars are spent should not be a partisan issue. I believe relief should be temporary, targeted and tied to COVID-19. We should not be using the suffering of Americans to play politics. 

The pandemic package that is currently before Congress includes nearly $2 trillion in spending. After excluding the stimulus payments to individuals, almost half of the bill's funding is not slated to be spent until after October 1, 2021. There seems to be an urgent need to pass a package, but I am troubled that those funds will not be used to help Americans who are suffering now. I am also concerned that less than 9% of the $1.9 trillion in proposed spending will go to combatting the virus through public health measures such as vaccination and more testing. Defeating the virus should be our primary objective- not using the crisis to pass a partisan wish list of items not related to COVID-19. 

I want to build consensus and move the country forward in a united manner. We have serious challenges facing our nation, and the American people deserve for their elected representatives to be serious and thoughtful about finding effective solutions to those problems. I would like to know your thoughts on this important subject. Your input on the brief survey below will be valuable in determining how I can best represent you.
 
Take this survey
 

 
Sincerely,

Representative Adriano Espaillat Statement in Support of the $1.9 Trillion COVID-19 Relief Plan

Espaillat Highlights Legislative Record as Transportation Champion


WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Representative Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) released the following statement in support of the $1.9 Trillion COVID-19 relief package put forth in President Biden’s American Rescue Plan:

“The American Rescue Plan is a robust vision that provides funding for vaccinations, transportation systems, unemployment assistance, support of state and local governments, and much more to help get Americans back on track as families continue to suffer due to the ongoing public health crisis,” said Rep. Adriano Espaillat. “I have long stood as a champion of public transportation and understand that such funding will provide critical support of entities like the Port Authority of New York as well as serve as a vital lifeline for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), which require vigorous federal funding to remain operational to ensure the economy of New York comes back to life. 

“COVID-19 had an immediate and overwhelming effect on transportation systems in my district and around the nation and there are millions of transportation and construction jobs associated with them. Our legislation is aimed at helping ensure these essential transit projects that have already gone through rigorous, bipartisan processes can move forward, including projects in red and blue States across the country. 

“The Republicans misinformation campaign does not surprise me. Specifically, about the BART to San Jose project, which was approved under the Trump Administration, has among the highest local share of any transit capital project in the country, and is not receiving special funding. Additionally, the allocation for the Seaway International Bridge, which is not taxpayer funded, would help cover the tolling revenue shortfall due to restrictions against non-essential travel put into place as a direct result of the COVID pandemic. These projects impact their respective regions similarly to how funding the MTA and the Port Authority is vital to New York’s economy. 

“While American families continue to suffer due to the ongoing public health crisis, I urge my Republican colleagues to put an end to the partisan posturing and to join my House Democratic colleagues and I to put forth a package to help families build back stronger and to help them get their lives back on track and overcome this pandemic for good.”

Declaración del congresista Adriano Espaillat en apoyo del plan de ayuda por COVID-19 de $1.9 billones

Espaillat destaca récord legislativo como defensor del transporte


WASHINGTON, DC – Hoy, el congresista Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) emitió la siguiente declaración en apoyo del paquete de ayuda por COVID-19 de $1.9 billones (trillones en el sistema numérico inglés) presentado en el Plan de Rescate Estadounidense del presidente Biden:

“El Plan de Rescate Estadounidense es una visión sólida que proporciona fondos para vacunas, sistemas de transporte, asistencia por desempleo, apoyo a los gobiernos estatales y locales, y mucho más para ayudar a que los estadounidenses se recuperen en momentos en que las familias continúan sufriendo debido a la actual crisis de salud pública”, dijo el Rep. Adriano Espaillat. “Durante mucho tiempo me he mantenido como un defensor del transporte público y entiendo que dichos fondos brindarán un apoyo fundamental a entidades como la Autoridad Portuaria de Nueva York y también servirán como un sustento vital para la Autoridad Metropolitana de Transporte (MTA), que requiere fondos para seguir funcionando para garantizar que la economía de Nueva York vuelva a la vida.

“El COVID-19 tuvo un efecto inmediato y abrumador en los sistemas de transporte en mi distrito y en todo el país y hay millones de empleos de transporte y construcción asociados con ellos. Nuestra legislación tiene como objetivo ayudar a garantizar que estos proyectos de transporte esenciales que ya han pasado por procesos bipartidistas rigurosos puedan avanzar, incluidos los proyectos en los estados rojo y azul de todo el país.

“La campaña de desinformación de los republicanos no me sorprende. Específicamente, sobre el proyecto de BART a San José, que fue aprobado bajo la Administración Trump, tiene una de las cuotas locales más altas de cualquier proyecto de capital de transporte en la nación y no está recibiendo fondos especiales. Además, la asignación para el Puente Internacional Seaway, que no es financiado por los contribuyentes, ayudaría a cubrir el déficit de ingresos por peajes debido a las restricciones contra los viajes no esenciales implementadas como resultado directo de la pandemia de COVID. Estos proyectos impactan en sus respectivas regiones de manera similar a cómo financiar la MTA y la Autoridad Portuaria es vital para la economía de Nueva York.

“Mientras las familias estadounidenses continúan sufriendo debido a la actual crisis de salud pública, insto a mis colegas republicanos a que pongan fin a la postura partidista y se unan a mis colegas demócratas de la Cámara y a mí para introducir un paquete para ayudar a las familias a recuperarse más fuertes y ayudarlas a volver a encarrilar sus vidas y superar esta pandemia para siempre"".

Congresswoman Beatty Heralds Historic House Passage of Equality Act   Helped lead introduction of LGBTQ+ rights bill
Yesterday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Equality Act, H.R. 5, comprehensive civil rights legislation that prohibits discrimination against members of the LGBTQ+ community in employment, education, credit, jury service, federal funding, housing, and public accommodations. Reacting to the vote, U.S. Congresswoman Joyce Beatty (OH-03), an original cosponsor of the Equality Act, issued the following statement:   
“No one should lose their job, be kicked out of their home, forced to leave school, or sacrifice their livelihood because of who they love or how they identify. Yet, in 2021, a person can get married on a Sunday and fired on Monday—or even face financial ruin—for those very reasons. I am proud to stand in strong solidarity with the LGBTQ+ community in Ohio’s Third Congressional District and across this great nation, and I call on the Senate to pass the Equality Act quickly. Let’s finally guarantee that all Americans are treated equally under the law.”

Delivering COVID-19 Relief
 
  
Dear Lindsey,
 
In December when we had to compromise with Senate Leader Mitch McConnell to pass a much needed COVID-19 relief bill, I told you I'd vote for it but that I'd get right to work on more aid in 2021. It was clear we needed to do more to speed up vaccine distribution and ensure everyone's economic wellbeing, and that's why we've been working hard in the House to put the president's American Rescue Plan into writing.
 
This week we are getting it done. 
 
The American Rescue Plan is coming to the House floor today, and I will be supporting it. First, it invests in vaccine distribution and production, speeding up the process of getting shots in arms. The sooner we get the virus under control, the sooner we can recover and rebuild.
 
Second, it invests in our communities. We also need to get folks back to school, back to work, and put dollars back into people's pockets. The $1,400 stimulus checks and other economic lifelines this plan provides will protect working families from falling further behind.
 
These are the key pillars of the
American Rescue Plan:
  
￼
  
Our goal is to pass it in the House this week, then send it to the Senate and have it signed by President Biden as soon as possible. Enacting this bill quickly will help us crush COVID-19, get our economy moving again and get our kids back in school.
  
 
Quickly & Efficiently Delivering Stimulus Checks
 
  
Lots of Northeastern Pennsylvanians told me throughout last year they had difficulty receiving their stimulus checks.
 
Earlier this week, I raised those concerns again with with IRS Commissioner during an Appropriations Subcommittee hearing to ensure his department is ready to help Americans receive future payments as quickly and as early as possible. Americans can't afford to experience continued issues and the IRS is essential in delivering economic relief to Americans across the country. 
 
Here is my exchange with the IRS Commissioner this week:
  
 
￼
 
  
 
Federal Dollars at Work in NEPA
 
  
Yesterday, I announced that Luzerne County Head Start has received its second installment of a federal grant for 2021. The installment of nearly $5 million will be used to continue providing young students in our area with a strong foundation for success later in life. As a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, I will continue to fight for federal investment in our children’s success, which is our country’s future success.
  
Read More
  
Last week, I was so proud to announce that four fire companies will be awarded federal funds to provide additional personal protective equipment (PPE) and essential supplies that will help keep them safe on the job. 
 
These grants are a critical resource for firefighters and communities in Northeastern Pennsylvania and we should continue investing in equipment that aids the incredible work they do.

COVID-19 Vaccine Dashboard
 
  
**Two Important Vaccine Updates**
 
Winter weather complicated vaccine distribution last week, and that unfortunately led to some delayed appointments. But things are getting back on track as the backlogs clear, and appointment availability should be picking up once again.
 
Let's end the week on a high note. We hit a significant milestone this week: all nursing facility residents and staff in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania who opted in to receive a COVID-19 vaccine are fully vaccinated with both doses. Our seniors who live in nursing homes have been the most vulnerable to this virus, and the staff charged with protecting them have been among the most challenged during this pandemic. I'm grateful to all the health care workers who had a hand in this achievement.
 
Here's the latest on vaccine distribution in PA-08.

Be safe and well,

Dear Lindsey,
 
It's been a busy 2 weeks for my office. I drove nearly 2,500 miles across our state and visited with small business owners, local officials, and concerned Montanans to talk about what's going on in our nation's capital.
 While traveling across Eastern Montana, I visited several local businesses including American Harvest, a hemp processing facility in Sidney; Eastern Montana Meats; and Meadowlark Brewing.

In Fallon County, I visited with local officials who explained how President Biden's decision to kill the Keystone XL Pipeline has already had a negative impact on their community. 
 
The Mayor of Baker and County Commissioners of Fallon showed me area that was supposed to be housing for Keystone XL workers and shared how the pipeline's cancellation will hurt the economic recovery of their community from the pandemic.

When I wasn't in Montana, I was busy focusing on important policy issues in DC that impact you back home. 
 
I introduced two pieces of legislation, The Forest Information Reform (FIR) Act and the REMAIN in Mexico Act.
 
The FIR Act amends the Cottonwood requirements for re-consultation in Forest Service plans when new information is found. This legislation allows the Forest Service to incorporate new information into their current plan rather than starting from scratch.
 
This bill is a common sense solution that will bring Forest Service Management out of a perpetual cycle of litigation and into a new era of efficiency by reversing the disastrous Cottonwood decision
 
The REMAIN in Mexico Act directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to continue to implement the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) implemented in January 2019 under Secretary Nielsen, which stipulates that non-Mexican nationals who arrive at or cross our southern border and claim asylum, but fail to meet the “credible fear test” are returned to Mexico to await the adjudication of their asylum claim.
 
We experienced the danger of the Obama-Biden practice of ‘catch and release.’ The Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) was one of the most effective policies to help end this practice. 
 
Montana may be far from the southern border, but ‘catch and release’ allows the immigration crisis to come to every town in America. It’s my hope that this legislation will deter illegal immigration, help Border Patrol secure our border, and keep the rest of our country safe.
 
I've been fighting for increased vaccine shipments for Montana and sent a letter to the Biden Administration requesting they increase the amount of vaccines they're sending to our state. Earlier this week we heard the good news that the Biden Administration is listening and have sent more vaccines our way!
 
I co-sponsored the VA VACCINE Act, which allows the VA to offer COVID-19 vaccines to all veterans regardless of their eligibility to enroll in the VA healthcare system, caregivers of veterans in certain long-term and home-based care programs, as well as veterans living abroad who rely on the Foreign Medical Program.
 
I am also glad to be helping Kevin McLean, a community leader in Helena who is gathering supplies to send to families struggling from the recent winter storms in Texas. Kevin is sharing updates on his progress and ways you can help on his Instagram page.

Dear Friends,
Sadly, this week we crossed a terrible milestone with more than 500,000 Americans lost due to COVID-19, including more than 4,500 Kentuckians. We remember all of the family, friends, neighbors, mentors, and many others taken too soon by this awful virus. With two safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines currently being administered each day to people in the Commonwealth and across the country, we move closer to defeating COVID-19 and returning to a sense of normalcy. I am hopeful that very soon we will have another vaccine approved for distribution to increase our vaccine supply. In Kentucky, we have had declining COVID-19 cases for six weeks in a row. I want to thank everyone who is taking COVID-19 precautions in order to make this possible. I also want to encourage everyone to roll up their sleeves when they have the opportunity to be vaccinated. Today, I want to share how I’m helping with vaccine distribution as your representative in Congress and share resources for receiving COVID-19 vaccines in Kentucky. 
Vaccine Work
￼
Rep. Guthrie speaking at a recent Health Subcommittee hearing
Defeating COVID-19 with safe and effective vaccines is my main focus in Congress. Through my oversight role on the Energy and Commerce Committee, I know that these vaccines have been developed with high efficacy requirements and without cutting any safety corners. I have supported five COVID-19 relief packages to help Kentucky families, workers, and businesses. These bills have included funding for development and manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. Summaries of each of the COVID-19 relief packages can be found HERE. I recently supported $8.75 billion to help states with vaccine distribution. Recently, Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) awarded $46.9 million to Kentucky for administering vaccines. In January, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) awarded more than $297 million to Kentucky for vaccine distribution and COVID-19 testing.
Through my senior leadership roles on the Energy and Commerce Committee, I have led hearings on COVID-19 vaccines and developed policy recommendations to help meet the ultimate goal of delivering vaccines to all Americans. I am committed to continuing this work on COVID-19 vaccines in my leadership role this Congress as the Republican Leader of the Health Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee. This committee has jurisdiction over HHS, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and other federal health agencies involved with COVID-19 response efforts. I will not stop working until all Kentuckians have had the opportunity to be vaccinated for COVID-19. 
Where to Find Vaccines
Kentucky Regional Sites On March 1, regional COVID-19 vaccination sites will open to Phase 1C in Kentucky. While I help ensure federal resources are available for Kentucky for vaccine distribution and other COVID-19 needs, decisions on vaccine eligibility phases are made by the state government. Phase 1C expands vaccine eligibility to all essential workers as well as Kentuckians who are 60 years old and older or 16 years and older with certain high-risk conditions. Kentuckians in Phase 1A and 1B will still be able to be vaccinated. You can also complete an online form to learn what phase you are in by clicking HERE or you can call 855-598-2246. A map of regional vaccination sites can be found HERE, and the COVID-19 hotline to answer questions is 800-722-5725.

2/26/21 13:03,Blaine's Bulletin: FFA Week,"￼ 
February 26, 2021
For Immediate Release | Contact: Georgeanna Sullivan (202) 225-2956 

BLAINE'S BULLETIN: FFA WEEK
With 2/3 of our state covered in farmland and being home to the second highest number of farms in the nation, Missouri knows a little something about the agricultural business. Our state is home to generations of skilled ag producers who play a critical role in our local economies, job market and food supply chain. And with an $88 billion agriculture industry, Missouri is not only a major supplier for the nation but the entire world. This week is Future Farmers of America (FFA) Week and with over 25,000 active Missouri FFA members, I am extremely encouraged that our state’s strong agricultural tradition will continue and grow with the next generation of Missourians. 
The FFA was started in 1928 by a group of young farmers with the mission to “prepare future generations for the challenges of feeding a growing population.” This still remains a major pillar of the FFA’s mission, but the organization has evolved over the years as agricultural opportunities have expanded and the industry has become more comprehensive. While planting and harvesting of course will remain the priority, FFA also helps high school students explore other areas of the industry and potential careers in agricultural biology, engineering, chemistry, veterinary care and business ownership. Through classroom education and hands-on, real world experience to help develop skills in areas of interest, FFA is helping keep Missouri’s agriculture industry alive and well. And with the members of our state’s organization achieving the highest number of American FFA Degrees – the highest achievable honor in FFA – of any state in the country, it looks like Missouri will continue to be a national industry leader. 
Not only does Missouri continue to be one of the biggest contributors to our nation’s traditional agricultural industry, but we have become a global leader in agricultural technology. Organizations like FFA are helping the next generation of agricultural enthusiasts learn about the technological advancements in the industry. Every day, researchers are figuring out ways things like drones, satellites and robots can be used to make life in one of the world’s most unpredictable industries a little bit easier. Our state has such a high concentration of researchers, innovators, and producers that we are now home to the “Ag Coast” of America, have become a major hub for agricultural science, and are helping set the “AgTech” tone for the rest of world. 
Farming and ranching are quintessentially Missourian and I’m grateful that organizations like FFA are helping keep our agricultural tradition going by providing education and experience to our state’s students. This industry has fed and supported families in our state for generations, my own being no exception. I helped pay my way through college raising hogs and cattle and my wife and I still run our family farm in St. Elizabeth. It can be one of the most challenging jobs there is, but also one of the most rewarding. Farmers and ranchers are tasked with feeding the world, and as the Representative of one of the top producing states in America, I will continue to do everything in my power to help Missouri farmers in Congress.

2/26/21 13:37,Baldwin Supports Bipartisan Legislation to Help Struggling Restaurants in Wisconsin,"

￼ 


  
Dear Lindsey, 
Senator Baldwin is supporting the reintroduction of the bipartisan, bicameral RESTAURANTS Act of 2021.   Supported by the Wisconsin Restaurant Association, the legislation is an updated proposal to establish a $120 billion revitalization fund to support independent restaurants and small franchisees as they deal with the long-term structural challenges facing the industry because of COVID-19. 
“For the last year, local restaurants and workers across Wisconsin have fought to keep their doors open, and they need our support now more than ever to survive this economic crisis,” said Senator Baldwin. “Many small and independent restaurants are operating at reduced capacity and may be forced to close their doors for good if we don’t act now. Our legislation will create a new revitalization fund that will help folks in Wisconsin and across the country get through this pandemic and keep our Made in Wisconsin economy moving forward.”  “Restaurants have suffered more losses in jobs and revenue than any other sector because of the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Kristine Hillmer, President & CEO of the Wisconsin Restaurant Association. “We have already lost many unique restaurants in our state that were the cornerstones of their communities. The majority of the remaining restaurant owners believe that it will be 7 to 12 months, or more, before business conditions return to normal for their restaurant. Restaurants need specific and targeted assistance to survive. The RESTAURANTS Act of 2021 establishes a $120 billion “Restaurant Revitalization Fund” to provide direct grants to eligible entities. The RESTAURANTS Act is vital to helping Wisconsin’s restaurants and restaurant employees survive the devastating impact of the pandemic and sustaining our state’s once vibrant restaurant industry.”  “We fully support the bipartisan RESTAURANTS Act of 2021 which addresses the incredible hardship restaurant and taproom operators like us have experienced over the past year,” said Dan Katt, Co-Founder & CEO of Good City Brewing, LLC in Milwaukee. “Our taproom restaurant in downtown Milwaukee is adjacent to Fiserv Forum and was forced to close on March 12, 2020 when the NBA season was suspended. Our revenue at that location dropped by 95% over the past year and while Paycheck Protection Program has helped us stay in business and keep many of our key employees, we face incredible hurdles to be able hire new staff, pay rent, and fulfill debt obligations in the future as we will not be able to operate at 100% capacity for many months. This is a critical piece of legislation that will help a small locally-owned business like ours eventually recover from an incredibly challenging time.”  “COVID-19 has greatly impacted our business. Since reopening on June 2, 2021 our sales have been reduced by approximately 40%,” said Jon Seybold, Owner of Houligans Steak & Seafood Pub in Eau Claire. “Even though the Paycheck Protection Program has helped, we are still playing ‘catch up’ financially. We had to use all of our business savings just to survive the 2+ month forced shutdown. The aid in the RESTAURANTS Act of 2021 could allow us to expand outdoor dining opportunities which are sure to be in high demand this upcoming season. The aid could also allow us to explore modifying our banquet room into extra dining since banquet business has ‘dried up’ and we believe we will be need to keep some type of social distancing well into the future.” 
The bipartisan RESTAURANTS Act of 2021 is modeled after legislation the authors introduced last Congress. Their new proposal would create a $120 billion Restaurant Revitalization Fund to provide relief to food service or drinking establishments that are part of a group of up to 20 facilities. Owners could apply for grants of up to $10 million to cover eligible expenses retroactively to February 15, 2020, and ending eight months after the legislation is signed into law.  Grants could be used to support payroll, benefits, mortgage, rent, utilities, building maintenance and construction of outdoor facilities, supplies (including protective equipment and cleaning materials), food, operational expenses, paid sick leave, debt obligations to suppliers, and any other essential expenses.  The bipartisan RESTAURANTS Act of 2021 also includes several new provisions to help restaurants and their employees and ensure the integrity of the program. These provisions would: 
	•	Update the award calculation based on annual loss from calendar year 2020 rather than quarterly.
	•	Provide grant eligibility for new restaurants that opened after January 1, 2020.
	•	Provide paid sick leave as an eligible expense for employees and provides a bonus amount to cover the cost of voluntarily providing 10 days of sick leave to employees.
	•	Provide Treasury the discretion to help reduce waste, fraud, and abuse.
	•	Impose reporting obligations on the Department of the Treasury to share who gets loans and demographic information about the recipients.
	•	Ensure that restaurants can use both the Employee Retention Tax Credit and the RESTAURANTS Act grant program, so long as they are not used for the same expenses.
Read more about the bipartisan RESTAURANTS Act of 2021 and see why the bill is also supported by the Independent Restaurant Coalition (IRC) and the National Restaurant Association (NRA) here.

An Ounce of Prevention is Worth a Pound of Cure 



It seems like every week or two there is a new story about personal information being stolen, corporate secrets taken and government agencies hacked. These threats are real, and we need to combat them. Over the years, nefarious actors have become relentless in their pursuit to hack U.S.-based companies, individuals, and the federal government.  The scale and frequency of these attacks continue to grow at an alarming pace. Now more than ever, the federal government and the private sector need to work together to protect our nation’s cyberinfrastructure. 

Cyberattacks can come from anywhere at any time. Nefarious actors can be a lone individual, a group of individuals, a terrorist organization, or a foreign government. The most recent cyberattack, dubbed 'Solar Winds', is a perfect example of why cybersecurity needs to be a top priority in this Congress and for the Biden Administration. The perpetrators of this attack, allegedly working with or for the Russian government, breached dozens of private companies and federal agencies. When all is said and done, this will likely be one of the most significant cyber breaches ever perpetrated against the federal government. Not to mention absolutely the most costly to taxpayers as systems will need to be destroyed and rebuilt across several different agencies and departments. The fact that Solar Winds was able to operate unabated for years is simply inexcusable and certainly not acceptable. This attack cannot be addressed by simply replacing software. These systems will need to be blown up at the hardware level and completely new systems will need to be developed and installed. Not an inexpensive undertaking across several federal agencies. Hence, the title of this weeks 'Long's Short Report' - "" An Ounce of Prevention is Worth a Pound of Cure .""

Whether it is this attack by Russia, the Chinese stealing intellectual property, or hacking groups attacking websites or corporations, we need to come up with a comprehensive plan to protect our nation’s cyberinfrastructure. A key to this is working hand in hand with the private sector. Congress needs to formulate a plan to facilitate public-private partnerships with cybersecurity firms and corporations. This will be key in ensuring that both public and private information technology infrastructure is secure from cyber threats. These public-private partnerships must also focus on securing the supply chain. President Trump made great strides in ensuring the supply chain is secure by removing Chinese telecommunications equipment and I hope that President Biden follows suit.

There is only so much the government can do though. A key part of making sure that your personal information is safe from hackers is to remain vigilant. Never give your personal information to someone over the phone, through email, or any other form of communication unless you absolutely trust them. Never use the same password across multiple platforms. If a company that has your personal information suffers a cyber-attack and your password is compromised, hackers can get into other accounts that you may have. Having a separate password across your online accounts will limit your exposure should your information be stolen in a cyber-attack.

Together, individuals, the federal government, and the private sector can work to prepare for and protect our nation from cyber-attacks. The federal government needs to take these cyber-attacks seriously. And in the category of 'too little too late' Congress needs to create a bipartisan, apolitical framework to protect our cyberinfrastructure, secure federal information technology infrastructure, and ensure that our intellectual property is protected. While running for President, President Biden stated he will not stand idly by in the face of cyberassaults on our nation. I hope that he will make good on his word and am looking forward to working with the President and my colleagues to come up with a plan to protect our nation from cyberattacks.

2/26/21 13:59,Congressman Gosar Denounces Democrat Land Grab in His District,"For Immediate Release

Congressman Gosar Denounces Democrat Land Grab in His District
 


WASHINGTON D.C. - Congressman Paul Gosar (AZ-04) issued the following statement after voting against H.R. 803, the Grand Canyon Protection Act.



“This falsely-named legislation has absolutely nothing to do with protecting the Grand Canyon. Instead, it is an open attack on Northern Arizona mining and the hard-working people of my district.



Speaker Pelosi and her liberal allies refused to hold a single hearing for meaningful consideration or debate of this legislation. In doing so, Democrats foisted a massive land grab of more than one million acres and permanently banned mining and other multiple-use activities in our great state of Arizona.



It is estimated that this harmful bill will destroy as many as 4,000 jobs and cost $29 billion in sacrificed economic activity. The withdrawal area also contains 4,204 acres belonging to the Arizona State Land Department for the benefit of Arizona’s school children. This withdrawal will mean hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenues for local communities and for our schools.

 

This bill is also an attempt to lock out the ability to mine high-grade uranium, a critical element for carbon-free renewable energy that has irreplaceable applications in defense and medicine. The real beneficiaries of this bill are Russia and other bad state actors who we must turn to in order to secure uranium for our domestic needs.



Because the domestic supply is scant, the United States imports 97% of uranium from foreign sources, including Russia. If we pass bills like the Grand Canyon Preservation Act, we will forever close this area and soon 100% of our uranium will be supplied by foreign nations. At the same time, our ability to provide for the defense or our nation and other necessary industries will be comprised because of this bill.



I urge my colleagues in the Senate to defeat this badly flawed legislation,” said Rep. Gosar.

2/26/21 14:12,Senator Rosen's Senate Briefing," ￼ 

  
Dear Fellow Nevadan, 
Welcome to this week’s edition of the Senate Briefing. The Senate is back in session this week. We’ve been busy holding confirmation hearings, introducing legislation, and more. 

￼
I’m excited and honored to serve as Chair of the newly formed subcommittee on Tourism, Trade, and Export Promotion!   Tourism-related industries drive job creation and economic growth in states across the country. The COVID-19 pandemic has posed significant challenges for Nevada’s tourism-heavy economy, and in communities across our nation that rely on travel, tourism, hospitality, and live entertainment. In this new leadership position, I pledge to work tirelessly to support the sustainable recovery of the tourism industry, highlight the challenges that our tourism-centered businesses face, and advocate for critical support as we recover from this ongoing economic crisis. I will also strive to support fair trade and export deals that protect American jobs, promote growth, and strengthen the economies of Nevada and the United States.
Are you looking forward to the work Senator Rosen will be doing as Chair of the Tourism, Trade, and Export Promotion subcommittee? 

￼
I recently introduced an important bipartisan bill with Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) to increase access to fast and reliable broadband service to unserved communities.  The American Broadband Buildout Act will provide up to $15 billion in matching grants to increase high-speed internet access for rural homes and businesses. 
￼

 Dear Oklahoma friends and neighbors:   It’s nice now, but last week, we all know that Oklahoma got a seven-day free trial of what is like to live near the North Pole. Oklahomans dealt with power outages, burst pipes, and damage to their homes due to the extreme weather. Now we are cleaning up and working on how we can prevent rolling blackouts in sub-zero temperatures and how can we keep utility bills low. I have stayed in close contact with our Oklahoma and regional energy partners to assess the risks, reasons, and response for the rolling blackouts. We have also discussed ways to protect consumers from major price spikes on their energy bill and maintain energy supplies for the future.   I’m grateful for the Oklahoma first responders, nonprofits, houses of worship, families, and businesses who once again lived the Oklahoma Standard to help their neighbors and the vulnerable during a tough week for many in our state. We still have work to do, but we will get through it together. It is clear we need to continue to prepare for future energy surges; assess the ongoing maintenance needs on our energy and water infrastructure; and learn best practices for future extreme weather events. Please continue to reach out to my office and your state and local public officials for assistance following the extreme weather. You can also call 2-1-1 to find organizations or nonprofits in Oklahoma that can help serve you and your family. Additionally, you can visit the Oklahoma Department of Human Services’ “Be A Neighbor” site to find local neighbor organizations to help HERE.   UPDATE: Oklahoma Energy   On his first day in office, President Biden began his all-out assault on American oil, natural gas and other traditional energy. He started by issuing Executive Orders to revoke the cross-border permit of the Keystone XL pipeline, which effectively stops the ongoing work to complete the pipeline that should connect to Cushing, Oklahoma and move oil safely south. Ironically, a few days later President Biden lifted the pressure against the Russian natural gas pipeline (Nord Stream 2) to Germany that is a problem for the future of Europe. So, now it is official American policy to not move oil from Canada by pipeline, but to protect Russia’s pipelines to Europe. Hard to figure this out.     President Biden also announced a moratorium on energy leasing on federal lands, which will reduce federal royalties into the US Treasury and will eventually cause our nation to buy more oil from other countries. He also rejoined the Paris Climate Agreement.    Energy is not just a theory for Oklahomans, it is our economy and our jobs. All types of energy. As we saw last week, energy diversity and resilient base power must be at the heart of our energy strategy. You cannot just eliminate fossil fuels and still keep us warm and keep our lights on. Oklahoma produces nearly five percent of all the oil used in the country, nine percent of all the natural gas used, and more than 10 percent of the wind electricity. We are truly an all-of-the-above energy state with 45 percent of our energy coming from renewable sources. But, when our valuable wind turbines freeze up in sub-zero temperatures, the solar panels are covered in snow and our gas processing freezes up, we need every back-up option.   Three weeks ago, I was selected to join the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources for the 117th Congress. I will continue to serve on the Senate Finance Committee, the Ethics Committee, the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, and the Committee on Indian Affairs. Serving on the Energy Committee will ensure Oklahomans have a seat at the table for conversations about how to move our nation forward with practical energy innovation, how to access rare earth minerals in America so we do not have to cater to the whims of communist China, and how to keep our air and water clean while fulfilling our energy needs.   CLICK HERE to read more about my opposition to President Biden’s immediate attack on Oklahoma’s traditional energy and the jobs associated with the industry that put food on our families’ tables.   CLICK HERE to watch my remarks on the Senate floor regarding President Biden’s call for unity at his inauguration and then immediately bullying energy-producing states like Oklahoma with his executive actions.   UPDATE: COVID-19 Funding through “Reconciliation”   I have been outspoken that Oklahomans are hurting from the health and economic impacts of COVID-19. This is a time for action, not just talk. In the past year, Congress has passed four bipartisan COVID relief bills with over $3 trillion of aid. I helped write major sections of the CARES Act, which is still providing aid to millions of Americans. Any future aid should focus on targeted COVID relief to those who need it most, not partisan pet projects, earmarks, and slush funds.    For example, in December, I supported COVID relief that provided nearly $20 billion for testing and vaccine development, billions of dollars for schools, small businesses and direct relief checks. As of today, hundreds of billions of dollars from the December COVID bill has still not been spent, including funds for the CDC and NIH.   Adding more and more debt just to say we are doing something makes a bad situation worse, especially when billions of dollars in the bill are not even for the pandemic.     President Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion COVID spending bill currently has millions of dollars for a subway project in San Francisco, a bridge in New York State, billions of dollars for education projects that start in 2022 or later, and much more. Hundreds of billions of dollars in the proposal have nothing to do with COVID relief, they were just added to a COVID bill in a hope to get them passed without anyone noticing. We noticed.    Every dime of COVID spending is borrowed money. We need to borrow only as much as needed to survive the pandemic, but we should not borrow one dime more than what is needed because all of this debt will have a long term effect on our economic future.     CLICK HERE to read more about my amendment to protect houses of worship from discrimination during the pandemic.   CLICK HERE to read more on my amendment to prevent Democrats from using the gimmicky budget process of “reconciliation” to raise taxes on small business. 
CLICK HERE to learn more about my vote to oppose the partisan budget resolution.
The Vaccine   Oklahomans are rolling up their sleeves to show the Oklahoma Standard in a new way, by choosing to receive the vaccine. Most seniors in Oklahoma have already received the vaccine (in fact Oklahoma is one of the top states in the country for vaccine distribution), but now seniors want to know if they can get out and see their family after the vaccine. Earlier this month, I sent a letter to the Director of the CDC requesting scientific guidance for how people, particularly seniors, can reengage with their families and communities after they have received the vaccine. I specifically referenced the isolation senior adults have endured and how they need clear direction on how to balance preventative measures while getting back to some kind of normal life. Everyone can make their own decisions, but people are interested in the science. There’s no reason clear guidance isn’t already out there for Oklahomans from the CDC. I will keep pushing.    CLICK HERE to read more about the letter.   CLICK HERE to watch my speech to call on the CDC to provide guidance to seniors and their families once they have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19.   Conscience Protection Act   This week, I reintroduced the Conscience Protection Act to protect healthcare providers, including health care professionals, entities, and health insurance plans from government discrimination if they decline to participate in abortions or assisted suicide. No one should have to check their faith or moral convictions at the door when they enter their workplace. Unfortunately, many health care workers don’t have anyone protecting them if they decline to participate in a forced abortion procedure.   My bill gives doctors, nurses, and other health care workers permanent protection from being discriminated against by employers if they do not wish to perform, participate in, or provide an abortion or an assisted suicide. Many entered the healthcare profession to protect life; they should not be forced to take a life in order to keep their jobs.   CLICK HERE to learn more about our important bill to protect the conscience rights of Oklahomans.   This week, I had the opportunity to question President Biden’s nominee to serve as Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, at a Senate Finance Committee hearing. I pressed Mr. Becerra on how he plans to protect the conscience rights of Americans and ensure faith-based individuals and entities receive fair treatment from the federal government.   This is important because in spite of existing federal laws protecting conscience rights for purchasers of healthcare plans, HHS under the Trump Administration declared that California violated federal law by forcing all its health plans to cover elective abortions. Xavier Becerra advocated for and enforced that law as the Attorney General of California. My Conscience Protection Act is necessary as a direct result of Attorney General Becerra’s actions to ignore the conscience rights of Californians and the possibility that he would ignore existing protections for all Americans if he becomes the Secretary of Health and Human Services.    CLICK HERE to watch my Q&A with Mr. Becerra at his nomination hearing.   I sent a letter, along with Arkansas’s Senator Tom Cotton and others, to President Biden asking him to withdraw Mr. Becerra’s nomination, citing his “lack of healthcare experience, enthusiasm for replacing private health insurance with government-run Medicare-for-all, and embrace of radical policies on immigration, abortion, and religious liberty, render him unfit for any position of public trust, and especially for HHS Secretary.” Mr. Becerra is a competent attorney, but the leadership of HHS during a pandemic should be someone who has medical, healthcare administration, or scientific experience.     CLICK HERE to read our letter.
CLICK HERE to watch our press conference.   UPDATE: Work to Stand for Life at All Stages   This year began with a strong showing of support from around the nation for the value of every child at the annual March for Life in Washington, DC. Oklahomans and others from around the nation gathered virtually this year to celebrate the value of life and speak for those who can’t speak for themselves. Ahead of the March for life, I spoke on the Senate floor to support our friends and neighbors who continue to stand for the value of every child, not just some.   CLICK HERE to watch my floor speech in support of the lives of the unborn.   I have made no secret that I believe that every child is valuable. Here are some of the actions we have already taken this year to speak out for the most basic right to life: 
	•	Led a letter to Senator Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer with 47 other pro-life senators to send a unified message that we have the votes to block any bill that would undermine the Hyde Amendment or any other pro-life protections. CLICK HERE to read more on our letter.
	•	Joined Senator Ben Sasse to reintroduce the Born-Alive Survivors Protection Act, which would protect newborns that survive abortions by requiring appropriate care and admission to a hospital. CLICK HERE to learn more about our bill to protect abortion survivors.
	•	Joined Oklahoma’s Senator Jim Inhofe to introduce the Protecting Individuals with Down Syndrome Act, which would ban a doctor from performing an abortion being sought because the unborn child has Down Syndrome. CLICK HERE to learn more about ways we can protect these precious babies.
	•	Led 46 of our colleagues to reintroduce the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act, which would make permanent the Hyde Amendment restrictions on using taxpayer dollars to fund abortions. CLICK HERE to learn more about our ongoing fight for this important bill.
	•	Joined Congressman Michael Cloud of Texas to reintroduce the bicameral Women’s Public Health and Safety Act, which gives states the authority to exclude abortion providers, like Planned Parenthood, from receiving Medicaid funds. CLICK HERE to learn more about our bill to prevent tax dollars from supporting abortions.
	•	Raised my concerns after President Biden’s Administration signed a Presidential Memorandum to repeal the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance Policy (PLGHA), often referred to as the expanded “Mexico City Policy,” that banned US taxpayer dollars from supporting international organizations that promote or perform abortion, as well as organizations that support other organizations that promote or perform abortions. CLICK HERE to read more on my views on this action.
	•	Joined Senator Lindsey Graham to reintroduce the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would provide common-sense protections for unborn children at 20 weeks after fertilization, a point at which there is significant scientific evidence that abortion inflicts tremendous pain on the unborn. CLICK HERE to learn more about our ongoing fight to move this bill to the finish line.
	•	Sent a letter to former US Small Business Administrator Jovita Carranza to stop Planned Parenthood affiliates from receiving loans from the second round of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which is targeted to assist businesses with the highest need, while Planned Parenthood employs about 16,000 people nationwide. CLICK HERE to read more on our letter.
We still have much work to do to protect life, but moving these important policy changes will ultimately get us one step further toward our goal of valuing the lives of our nation’s unborn babies who deserve their right to life.   Vote to Acquit Donald Trump   On February 13, former President Trump was acquitted by the Senate. I simply could not support removing someone from office who is not in office, which is the vote I am required to take in impeachment proceedings. Holding an impeachment trial after someone has left office is unconstitutional. In fact, prior to the trial, I supported a point of order on the constitutionality of the trial, and he was acquitted by the Senate for the Articles of Impeachment presented by the House.   The US Constitution outlines the basic process for impeachment and trial of the president, but it says nothing about trying a former president: “The president…shall be removed from office on impeachment…” (Article II, Section 4) and “when the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside.” (Article I, Section 3, Clause 6) Additionally, “judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office.” (Article I, Section 3, Clause 7).   Originally four states in 1787 had impeachment clauses in their state constitutions that specifically allowed impeaching a former official, but when they wrote the US Constitution, they only allowed impeachment of current officials, nothing about former officials.   Focusing on Conservative Values   This morning, I spoke at the opening of the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) to discuss our Bill of Rights, how it relates to our First Amendment right of religious freedom, and how Americans can live out our faith. That is one of my favorite topics. You can watch the full speech HERE:

￼
Keeping You in the Loop 
	•	The EQUALITY Act is once again in the news this week as the House announced it plans to pursue this misguided legislation with a good name. No one should be discriminated against for any reason. I believe each person is created in the image of God and has value and worth; every person deserves respect. But this bill radically guts religious freedom protections and changes labor law in America and will create endless lawsuits across the country. It actually allows a person that is not hired after an interview to sue the company for not hiring them based on the person’s “perception, even if not accurate” opinion of why they were not hired. 
	•	Last week the Oklahoma Congressional delegation formally thanked our Oklahoma National Guard members, who kept everyone safe during President Biden’s inauguration. Cindy and I were able to directly express our by gratitude by showing them around the US Capitol. CLICK HERE to read the letter to our OKNG.
	•	February is Black History Month, and it offers us an opportunity to pause and recognize the contributions of our Black Oklahomans. I rose this year to commemorate the important work of Oklahomans like Judge Vicki Miles-LaGrange and OK State Senator Maxine Horner CLICK HERE to watch my speech on the Senate floor to remember, honor, and thank the Black Oklahomans who have helped shape our state and nation.
	•	This month, I introduced the Working Families Flexibility Act, which would give employees more flexibility on how to use their overtime benefits. Allowing private-sector workers in Oklahoma the flexibility to choose paid time off or work over-time for extra pay is a good step to ensure the private sector and government remain competitive employers. We can and should continue to modernize our technology and our laws to give Oklahomans the opportunity to focus on their families and their careers. CLICK HERE to learn more about the bill.
	•	Communist China remains a threat to our national security and a threat to freedom-loving people worldwide from their communist regime’s oppressive actions. We can and should respond to the People’s Republic of China (PRC) anti-democratic national security law, the Law of the People’s Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. Earlier this month I joined a bipartisan group of senators to reintroduce the bipartisan Hong Kong Safe Harbor Act to protect Honkongers from Chinese oppression. CLICK HERE to read more about the bill. We also introduced a bipartisan bill to ensure that goods made with Uyghur forced labor—a Muslim religious minority in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR)—do not enter the United States. CLICK HERE to learn more about our bill to prevent China from benefitting from just one of its horrible labor practices.
	•	At a recent Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing to consider the nomination of Ms. Neera Tanden to serve as the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, I had the opportunity to ask Ms. Tanden several questions about her disparaging remarks previously on social media accusing people of faith like the Little Sisters of the Poor, who she said wielded their faith like a “cudgel.” I believe we should treat all people with value and dignity because they are created in God’s image. Oklahomans and people around the world should be able to freely have a faith. Living your faith is not wielding it. CLICK HERE to hear my full Q&A of Ms. Tanden.
	•	I was proud to join Senator Tim Scott to introduce a resolution declaring the week of January 25 as National School Choice Week. Every child deserves the opportunity to dream of a bright future regardless of their zip code or socioeconomic status. Students should not be limited in their educational opportunity as they wait for improvement in their local school. I support the right of every parent and student to have open access to the best classrooms that meet their educational goals. CLICK HERE for more information on our resolution.
	•	It was a great day for Oklahoma earlier this year when the US Navy announced that a future Navajo-class towing, salvage, and rescue ship will be named USNS Muscogee Creek Nation (T-ATS 10) to honor the self-governed Native American Tribe located in Okmulgee. The decision to honor our Muscogee (Creek) service members by naming a Navajo-class towing, salvage, and rescue ship the USNS Muscogee Creek Nation will help remind young people and future generations of the sacrifices made by the Nation for the entire country.

How to Apply for FEMA Assistance
 


ICYMI: All counties in TX-08 have been approved for disaster assistance after the winter storm. That means that all residents are eligible to apply for aid. Please see below for more information on the services that are available and the next steps to take.



Helpful hint – the quickest way to apply for disaster assistance is online at DisasterAssistance.gov.



FILE A CLAIM: If you have damage from the Texas severe winter storms and have insurance, contact your insurance company to file a claim. When you apply for FEMA disaster assistance, you need to provide your insurance claim information. Those who have underinsured or uninsured losses may apply online or by calling 1-800-621-3362.



Local resources and volunteers may be able to assist with needs not covered by insurance. Visit Texas 211 for a list of resources searchable by zip code or call 2-1-1.



FOOD ASSISTANCE: The U.S. Department of Agriculture approved Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients to apply for replacement benefits for food lost or destroyed due to the severe winter weather by dialing 2-1-1.

MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES: To assist people in the impacted area in coping with the stress of the winter storms, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration activated the Disaster Distress Helpline. This toll-free, multilingual, and confidential crisis support provides immediate crisis counseling and support. Residents in affected areas may call or text 800-985-5990 to connect with a trained crisis counselor.

AVOID SCAMS: Do not disclose information to any unsolicited telephone calls and e-mails. Do not trust anyone who offers financial help and then asks for money or personal information. The Department of Homeland Security, FEMA, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention staff never charge for disaster assistance. 

Important note – all FEMA disaster assistance will be provided without discrimination on the grounds of race, color, sex (including sexual harassment), religion, national origin, age, disability, limited English proficiency or economic status. If you believe your civil rights are being violated, call 800-621-3362.

2/26/21 15:30,February Update from Congressman Massie,"Friend,



I want to provide you with an update on my work in Congress.



The month's highlights include joining Kennedy on the Fox Business Network to discuss the unconstitutionality of President Trump's second impeachment trial. As I told Kennedy, if we are going to impeach past presidents, I'm calling dibs on FDR.



I am also pleased to announce that I have received my committee assignments for the 117th Congress. I will continue serving on the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and I will begin serving on the important House Judiciary Committee. I'll have more to say about these committees below.



On the legislative front, I recently introduced H.R. 899, a one-sentence-long bill that seeks to abolish the Federal Department of Education. I am pleased to report that the bill has already attracted 12 cosponsors.



Finally, it is time to de-occupy D.C. and to send our great soldiers home. There is no threat, but the Swamp wants to project that image so it can pass new laws to steal your liberty. I discussed this issue in more detail with Tucker Carlson on FOX News, and below is a clip of the interview.



For more details about these topics, please continue reading.



You can also keep track of my Congressional work on my regularly updated social media accounts. If you aren't following me on Facebook and Twitter already, I invite you to do so.

Massie: ""It's time to de-occupy D.C. and send our great soldiers home.""



In case you missed it, I was a guest on Tucker Carlson's FOX News show to discuss how Democrats are using National Guardsmen in Washington, D.C., for political theater.



The Democrats are using these troops as a prop because they want to advance the narrative, legislatively and through executive orders, of domestic terrorism. But they define domestic terrorism so broadly that it includes many of the guardsmen themselves.



It is time to de-occupy D.C. and to send our great soldiers home.





SBA A+


Massie Receives A+ Rating on Susan B. Anthony List National Pro-Life Scorecard



This is what Susan B. Anthony List had to say about my pro-life record when announcing I had received their top score of A+:



""Congressman Massie has voted consistently to protect the lives of the unborn as well as the consciences of taxpayers who don't want their hard-earned tax dollars paying for abortion domestically or internationally. Rep. Massie has defended the Trump administration's pro-life regulatory efforts from pro-abortion attacks to prohibit their implementation.""



Thank you for the A+ rating, Susan B. Anthony List!

Massie Tells Kennedy: ""If We're Going to Impeach Past Presidents, I'm Calling Dibs on FDR.""



In case you missed it, I was recently invited to appear on Fox Business's ""Kennedy"" to discuss efforts to criminalize free speech. This topic was at the center of President Trump's second impeachment trial.



I voted against impeaching President Trump for the second time, just as I voted against impeaching him the first time. Even Chief Justice Roberts refused to officiate or oversee the Senate trial this time around, because it is plainly unconstitutional to hold a Senate impeachment trial for a person who is no longer the president. 



It's as simple as that.





Massie Announces Committee Assignments for the 117th Congress



As I mentioned above, I have received my committee assignments for the 117th Congress. 



I'm honored to continue representing Kentucky on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. Ten new GOP members will join us on the committee this year, including my friends Congressman Tim Burchett (R-TN) and Congresswoman Nancy Mace (R-SC).



In addition, I have been appointed to the Judiciary Committee this Congress. The committee has jurisdiction over laws that will affect intellectual property, industrial hemp, civil liberties, firearms, and other topics that originally motivated me to run for Congress.





Massie Introduces One-Sentence Long Bill to Abolish Federal Department of Education (H.R. 899)



I have introduced H.R. 899, a bill to abolish the federal Department of Education. The bill, which is one sentence long, states, ""The Department of Education shall terminate on December 31, 2022.""



Unelected bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. should not be in charge of our children’s intellectual and moral development. States and local communities are best positioned to shape curricula that meet the needs of their students. Schools should be accountable. Parents have the right to choose the most appropriate educational opportunity for their children, including home school, public school, or private school.



Original cosponsors include Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN), Rep. Jeff Duncan (R-SC), Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), Rep. Jody Hice (R-GA), Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC), and Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX). Since H.R. 899's introduction, Congresswoman Mary Miller (R-IL), Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), Congressman Randy Weber (R-TX), and Congressman Louie Gohmert (R-TX) have signed on as well.



Thank you for reading this newsletter.

COMMITTEE UPDATE
MEETING TIME
Week in Review
Before traveling back to Washington DC for a legislative session week, I spent time below the bridge in Grand Traverse and Otsego Counties talking with constituents about their concerns and issues affecting their businesses, their students, and our state. I wanted to take a minute and remind everyone that if you go to my website there is a link for meeting requests. While COVID has created unique circumstances surrounding our typical meeting opportunities, I still make it a top priority to meet with constituents - both virtually and in-person - and I encourage you to reach out. 

This week I had the opportunity to meet with soldiers in the Michigan National Guard who have been sent to D.C. I cannot overstate how grateful our entire Nation is for their service and dedication. Nearly all of the soldiers I met with are from the Upper Peninsula and Northern Michigan. I firmly believe that it is time to get our Guardsmen and women home to their families and back to their lives. They have answered the call, dealt with adverse conditions, and continue to make us all so proud. I look forward to seeing them again back home in the near future. 

I also had the opportunity this week to join the United States Air Force for a briefing, visit with the crew, and flight aboard the KC-46 during a refueling training mission. As a Member of the House Armed Services Committee, one of my highest priorities is to help ensure readiness across all of our Armed Services, and to make certain all of our warfighters have the tools and capabilities needed to protect our Nation.

I appreciate you taking the time to read this week's Bergman Brief. I look forward to sharing some exciting news of the legislation and projects we are working on both in D.C. and in the District.
Respectfully,

Jack Bergman

(Gaylord Herald Times) Bergman Proposes Naming Gaylord VA Clinic After Former State Lawmaker Andrews

U.S. Rep. Jack Bergman, R-Watersmeet, has introduced legislation to name the new Gaylord VA Community Based Outreach Clinic in honor of the late Steve Andrews.

""Corpsman Steve Andrews lived a life dedicated to service and to his fellow countrymen. It is my hope that our plan to designate the new (VA clinic) in Gaylord in his honor will be a small tribute to his legacy of service to our Northern Michigan community and the United States,"" Bergman said in a statement Wednesday.

The new Gaylord VA Community Based Outpatient Clinic located at 2782 S. Otsego Ave., officially opened its doors last August. The 18,362-square-foot clinic provides outpatient primary care, mental health, telehealth, laboratory services, home based primary care, women’s health and whole health services.

The For Country Caucus, a group of military veterans serving in Congress and dedicated to working together to create a more productive government, announced new leadership and a growing caucus membership for the 117th Congress. A retired Lt. General in the Marine Corps, U.S. Representative Jack Bergman will join the Caucus for the 117th Congress.

“With forty years serving in the United States Marines Corps and earning the rank of Lt. General, Congressman Jack Bergman is the highest-ranking combat Veteran to have ever served in the House of Representatives and I am honored to have him join the For Country Caucus. Rep. Bergman’s vast military experience will be a tremendous asset to our group,” said Republican Co-Chair of the For Country Caucus, Congressman Van Taylor.

“I’m proud to be a member of the bipartisan For Country Caucus. Far too often the strong, bipartisan work done every day in D.C. is drowned out by the noise of partisan bickering. This caucus, comprised of men and women who have served in our Nation’s uniform, will continue to focus on policy to better our communities and country as whole,” said Rep. Bergman.

(Washington Examiner) To Diminish Terror Finance, Audit International Organizations

America gives foreign aid and supports various international bodies with the best of intentions. And yet, international aid, by its nature, usually goes to war-torn areas and places with terrorist insurgents and similar groups.

Luckily, late last year, Rep. Jack Bergman, along with Reps. Dan Crenshaw, Mike Johnson, and Joe Wilson introduced the International Spending Transparency Act to create a unit within the State Department to audit funds that go to multilateral and international organizations, with the goal of ensuring funds aren’t going to designated terrorist organizations or various hostile governments, such as Iran, Syria, or China.

Bergman’s bill is a great step toward shining sunlight into this area, and it has the potential to make a significant difference.

(Coin World) Bills In Congress Seek $200 Limit, First Responder Coins

Two separate pieces of new numismatic legislation are before Congress — one in the Senate seeks to limit the face value of U.S. coin denominations, while a House measure seeks commemorative coins recognizing first responders and other health care workers for their contributions during the COVID-19 pandemic.

On Feb. 8, Rep. Jack Bergman, R-Mich., introduced H.R. 905, which was sent to the House Committee on Financial Services for consideration.

A spokesman for Bergman’s office did confirm for Coin World that H.R. 905 seeks a three-coin program.

Bergman Introduces Legislation to Name New Gaylord VA Clinic in Honor of Navy Corpsman Steve Andrews

Rep. Jack Bergman introduced legislation to name the new Gaylord VA Community Based Outreach Clinic (CBOC) in honor of the late Steve Andrews. Andrews was a beloved member of the Gaylord community and a state legislator representing the 106th District, having previously served our Nation overseas at the U.S. Navy Hospital in Guam and as a medic in the 1st Marine Division and Marine 1st Force Reconnaissance Company in Vietnam.

Rep. Bergman stated, ""Corpsman Steve Andrews lived a life dedicated to service and to his fellow countrymen. It is my hope that our plan to designate the new CBOC in Gaylord – a place where we heal those who made incredible sacrifices for our Nation-- in his honor will be a small tribute to his legacy of service to our Northern Michigan community and the United States.”

Bergman Cosponsors Legislation Supporting Local Health Providers

This week Rep. Bergman became an original cosponsor of H.R. 1349, the COVID-19 Hospital and Health Provider Loan Forgiveness Act. Many health providers in Michigan – especially in rural and remote communities – are near the brink of financial insolvency as non-emergency treatments and procedures were cancelled or indefinitely postponed due to COVID-19. H.R. 1349 would forgive loans given under the Medicare Accelerated Payments program for health provider expenses and lost revenues that are directly attributable to the pandemic. To qualify, hospitals would be required to show they used at least 60% of payments on healthcare worker compensation, they did not surprise bill any COVID-19 patient, and they did not provide pay increases or bonuses to hospital officers or administration.

Bergman Helps Introduce Broadening Online Opportunities through Simple Technologies (BOOST) Act

Rep. Bergman recently applauded the FCC’s Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF), which is allocating over $9 Billion for highspeed rural broadband infrastructure expansion in unserved and underserved areas. The work itself, however, will take place over the course of the next 10 years. In the meantime, H.R. 1362 - BOOST Act proposes to allow homeowners is RDOF-eligible areas to claim a $300 tax credit on their purchase of a mobile hotspot or similar technology to increase their connection speeds.

Bergman Cosponsors Bill in Support of Air Traffic Controllers

Rep. Bergman has once again cosponsored the newly-reintroduced H.R.1283 – CONTRACT Act.  In order to support air safety and the continuity of operations at airports with FAA contract towers like Sawyer International Airport, this bill would allow a retired federal controller to continue receiving his or her federal retirement payments while working in their next job as a controller at an FAA contract tower.

Bergman Sends Letter to Secretary of Defense Austin and Deputy Secretary Hicks Highlighting Concerns Surrounding this Administration’s Commitment to the U.S. Navy’s Shipbuilding

The letter stated in part, ""In Deputy Secretary Hicks’ Senate confirmation hearing, she described China as the “measuring stick” by which America must gauge its own capabilities. The U.S. Navy must be prepared to compete, or we will face a future in which the seas are dominated by China. Even more alarming are the predictions within the 2018 National Defense Strategy Commission, to which Deputy Secretary Hicks contributed. Within this document, the commission predicts a bleak future in which the People’s Liberation Army Navy intimidates America and its allies through sea dominance, which results in China overwhelming Taiwan or denying America and its allies access to the South China Sea.""
Bergman Cosponsors H.R. 303, the Retired Pay Restoration Act

Currently, Veterans with more than 20 years of service and a disability rating of 50% or more can receive both their Department of Defense retirement pay and VA disability compensation at the same time. For those Veterans with 20 years of service who have a disability rating of less than 50%, their DOD retirement is deducted by the amount of their disability compensation. H.R. 303 would stop this unfair offset of Veterans’ benefits, and I’m proud to support this legislation because those who sacrificed to defend our freedoms deserve the full amount of what our Nation promised to them.

Bergman Backs Expanded Vaccine Eligibility at VA

This week, Congressman Bergman cosponsored the bipartisan H.R. 1276 - VA VACCINE Act. This bill would allow the Department of Veterans Affairs to vaccinate Veterans not currently enrolled in the VA healthcare system, as well as their caregivers and Veterans living overseas.

Operation Engage Michigan Launched

The United States Drug Enforcement Administration launched a new comprehensive law enforcement and prevention initiative aimed at reducing drug use, abuse, and overdose deaths.  “Operation Engage” allows participating field divisions to focus on the biggest drug threat and resulting violence in their respective geographic areas. The initiative builds on and replaces DEA’s 360 Strategy and now allows field divisions to customize plans and direct resources to target the drug that presents the greatest threat to public health and safety in their jurisdictions. The Detroit Field Division (DFD) submitted one of the 11 proposals approved in the initial round of funding.   The DFD will utilize the aforementioned resources to focus on improving the drug threat in the Northern Michigan geographic area.

The Operation Engage initiative encourages partnerships with healthcare professionals, as well as engagement with community and social service organizations best positioned to provide long-term assistance and support for building drug-free communities.  The below link has additional information pertaining to how specifically the DEA will work the Chippewa County communities most affected by opioid misuse.

National Park Service Announces $70.7 Million in Historic Preservation Grants to States and Tribes
The National Park Service (NPS) announced the distribution of $55.7 million in historic preservation grants for states, territories, and partnering nations, and $15 million in historic preservation grants to 200 tribal historic preservation offices.

Administered by the NPS, these funds are appropriated annually by Congress from the Historic Preservation Fund (HPF). Since its inception in 1977, the HPF has provided more than $2 billion in historic preservation grants to states, tribes, local governments, and non-profit organizations.  

“These funds provide much-needed support to our state, tribal, and local partners to preserve their unique cultural heritage for future generations,” said NPS Deputy Director Shawn Benge. ""Education programs, historic structure rehabilitation and cultural art installations are just some of the diverse and creative ways these grants help further our commitment to telling all American's stories.""

The State of Michigan received $1,362.856. The Bay Mills Indian Community, Keweenaw Bay Indian Community, Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, Little Traverse Bay Bands of Odawa Indians, Match-e-be-nash-she-wish Band of Pottawatomi Indians of Michigan, Nottawaseppi Huron Band of the Potowatomi, Pokagon Band of Potawatomi Indians, and Saginaw Chippewa tribe received a combined total of $557,124.

Award-Winning Guide Helps Michigan Schools Make the Most of their Forests

The Landscape Scale Restoration Program is a competitive grant program administered by the USDA Forest Service State and Private Forestry program that promotes collaborative, science-based restoration of priority forest landscapes and furthers priorities identified in State Forest Action Plans. The program helps ensure that our nation’s forests continue to provide important benefits to the American public, including timber and fuel wood, wildlife habitat, watershed protection and well-paying rural jobs.

Several hundred schools in Michigan own a school forest, an incredible resource that educators and administrators may not always fully utilize. In 2019, to help these schools reap the educational, recreational and economic benefits of their forests, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources (DNR) developed and published the Michigan School Forest Guide with support from a Forest Service Landscape Scale Restoration grant.

Aleda E. Lutz VAMC Helps VA Reach Milestone Vaccinating its 1 Millionth Veteran

The Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) Veterans Health Administration vaccinated its 1 millionth Veteran with their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine. Aleda E. Lutz VAMC has administered 5,006 first doses of the Moderna vaccine to our Veterans and 1,762 second doses. The VA began COVID-19 immunizations in December 2020. As of February 17, VA has vaccinated 329,685 of Veterans with a second dose.

Second doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine are given 21 days after the first dose, second doses of the Moderna vaccine are given 28 days after the first dose; the second dose completes the course of vaccination. Currently, our medical center is receiving the Moderna vaccine.

VA’s COVID-19 National Summary publishes vaccination data daily on Veterans,  including information on employee and federal partner vaccinations. For those reviewing the site, when an individual receives both doses from VA, they have completed their vaccine course; therefore, “second dose” and “completed” are synonymous.

VA follows current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidance and the VA COVID-19 Vaccination Distribution Plan. During the limited supply phase, VA facilities have made progress through CDC Phase 1a and are offering vaccines to Veterans in Phase 1b, which includes Veterans aged 65 and older. However, some sites are offering vaccine to additional Veterans at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 as supply permits.

“VA guidance encourages local flexibility in order to maximize COVID-19 vaccine access and efficiency and limit potential vaccine waste,” said Acting VA Under Secretary for Health Richard Stone, M.D. “In this limited supply phase, our COVID-19 vaccination strategy is balancing site-specific resources, facility needs, vaccine availability, and status of the pandemic locally, as well as strict storage, handling and transportation parameters of available vaccines.”

Dr. Barbara Bates, Aleda E. Lutz VAMC Director stated, “We are encouraged by the number of Veterans we have been able to vaccinate so far and look forward to meeting VA’s goal of offering vaccines to all eligible Veterans and employees who want to be vaccinated.”

Protecting the Taxpayer: Opposing the $1.9 Trillion Partisan Wish List

This week, House Democrats are using a process called budget reconciliation to pass a $1.9 trillion package they are calling COVID-19 relief.

Only 9% of the ""American Rescue Plan"" is allocated for public health spending to combat COVID-19, and nearly half - 45% - of the funding will not even be spent until 2022. Now - as our small businesses are closing, our students are suffering because schools cannot reopen, and our rural communities are begging for more doses of the vaccine - is not the time to be spending billions of dollars on an underground train in Silicon Valley or providing benefits to illegal immigrants.

The last COVID relief package was passed by Congress only 7 weeks ago, and there is still more than $1 trillion in unspent funds. We should be focusing on ensuring the money Congress has already appropriated gets to the individuals, families, and communities that need it most.

Americans need relief now, and any spending package we pass should be targeted, immediate, and - most importantly - directly tied to helping our families and communities recover from this pandemic. We must focus on crushing this virus and restoring our way of life. This package does not do that, and the people of Central Washington deserve better.

A Voice for Rural Communities: Standing Strong Against the Massive Land Grab
Newhouse: Massive Land Grab Legislation Will Devastate Rural Communities in the West
I spoke on the House floor this week in opposition to H.R. 803, a massive, partisan federal land grab package affecting lands and waters in Colorado, Arizona, California, and Washington. The bill creates 1.5 million acres of new wilderness (the most restrictive federal land use designation), permanently withdraws 1.2 million acres from mineral production, and expands nearly 110,000 acres of national monument land.

The American people deserve to access our nation's public lands - not to be locked out of them. A wilderness designation does not guarantee the protection of these lands. In fact, in many cases, this designation can hinder our ability to properly care for them. This package will not only harm our energy independence, restrict public access and recreation on our lands, and increase the poor health of our nation's forests; but it will devastate rural communities in the West.

As a lifelong farmer, I have always considered myself on the front lines of responsible conservation efforts. My livelihood depends on the health of our lands and natural resources. Similarly, the livelihoods of ranchers, miners, foresters, and pipeline workers are also dependent on active, responsible management of our lands.

The partisan wilderness bill does more to hurt the lives and livelihoods of Americans in the West than it does to protect and conserve our public lands, and that is why I voted against it. We should be encouraging local conservation and preservation efforts - not top-down bureaucratic mandates that ignore the voices of the communities most impacted.

Americans Deserve the Truth About COVID-19

On Tuesday, I joined my colleagues in sending a letter to Health and Human Services Deputy Inspector General Christi Grimm requesting an investigation into the National Institutes of Health's relationship with the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) in Wuhan, China.

The letter follows an editorial published by the Washington Post questioning an association between the break out of the COVID-19 pandemic and the WIV, a research lab that is funded in part with U.S. tax dollars.

If a U.S. taxpayer-funded laboratory in China is hiding answers about the origins of COVID-19, Americans deserve to know about it.

Working for Central Washington Potato Growers

I had a great virtual meeting on Wednesday with the Washington State Potato Commission. Potatoes are Washington's third largest commodity, and our state is the second largest producer in the country. I had the opportunity to speak with producers about many of the issues facing Washington's potato growers, and we discussed how I can work with them - particularly in my role on the House Appropriations Committee - to advance our shared goals of modernizing critical water infrastructure our region relies on, improving international trade agreements, and supporting agriculture research.
It is an honor and a privilege to represent you in Congress. 

Sincerely,
Dan Newhouse

TENNESSEE COVID-19 VACCINE DISTRIBUTION UPDATES
On Monday, February 22, Tennessee began vaccinating residents 65+ and Phase 1b, which includes K-12, Child Care and Other First Responders.
The state of Tennessee has launched a new website where you can register to receive a COVID-19 vaccine at one of Tennessee's County Health Departments. You can visit the website at vaccinate.tn.gov.
The Tennessee Department of Health (TDH) recently expanded access to vaccines with a particular focus on rural and underserved areas.

TENNESSEE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH ISSUES LONG-TERM CARE FACILITY VISITATION UPDATE
This week, the Tennessee Department of Health issued an update regarding the state’s long-term care facility visitation restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic: “State-specific visitation restrictions for long-term care facilities will end effective February 28, 2021. With the limited visitation restrictions no longer in place at the state level, state licensed long term care facilities (assisted care living facilities, residential homes for the aged, and non-CMS certified nursing homes) may develop their own facility-specific visitation policies. These facilities are encouraged to reference industry best practices, including the federal CMS guidance, when developing their policies. While the state-specific restrictions will end this Sunday, I want to emphasize that skilled nursing facilities certified by federal CMS must continue to follow the federal CMS Visitation Guidance, pursuant to federal limitations.”

IMPORTANT COVID RELIEF CHECK INFORMATION
If you’re eligible for a COVID stimulus relief check and have not yet received it, it may be because you need to file a 2020 tax return to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit. You have a few options on how to do this, according to the IRS:
You can use one of the IRS Free File partners to electronically file a 2020 tax return and claim your credit; or
In early February, you can use the IRS’ Volunteer Income Tax Return Locator tools to find somewhere local to get free tax help; or
Or, you can file a paper Form 1040 or Form 1040-SR and claim the credit on line 30. The Instructions for Forms 1040 and 1040-SR provide information starting on page 57 on how to compute your credit.

·    Governor Ned Lamont announced that the state will continue with an age-based approach to expanding eligibility to the COVID-19 vaccine. Click here to see if you are eligible for the vaccine and to make an appointment. Though this is a decision that Governor Lamont and the Department of Public Health make at the state level, Senator Murphy understands that there is huge demand to get the vaccine, especially among people with pre-existing conditions and in underserved communities. He will continue to focus on ramping up the federal production and distribution of the vaccine to our state so we can get more people in Connecticut vaccinated as quickly as possible. 
·     On Monday, Senator Murphy released a statement on the U.S. surpassing 500,000 COVID-19 related deaths. 
·    This week, during their confirmation hearings, Senator Murphy asked President Biden’s nominees to serve as the U.S. Surgeon General, Dr. Vivek Murthy, and Assistant Secretary of Health, Dr. Rachel Levine, about the need for vaccine equity and opportunities for summer programs that address social, emotional, and educational loss as a result of the pandemic. You can watch the full discussion here. 
·    Governor Lamont announced that his administration has filed an objection to motions under consideration at the Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) to approve plans submitted by Eversource Energy and the United Illuminating Company to begin allowing for the disconnection of customers for non-payment for the time since PURA first implemented a shut-off moratorium in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
·    Senator Murphy, joined by U.S. Senator Dan Sullivan, Republican of Alaska, introduced the Leveraging Integrated Networks in Communities (LINC) to Address Social Needs Act, legislation that would offer grants to states to establish statewide or regional partnerships to better coordinate the work of health care and social service providers, and improve the health and well-being of Americans as a result. 
·    This week, Senator Murphy joined Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, John Cornyn of Texas, and Susan Collins on Maine in introducing the Partnering Aspiring Teachers with High-Need Schools (PATHS) to Tutor Act, legislation that will expand access to one-on-one and small group tutoring in underserved communities during the pandemic. The bill will also strengthen the pipeline of future teachers by placing teacher-candidates into tutoring roles. 
·    Senator Murphy sent a letter to the Biden administration’s COVID-19 Taskforce to request that federal contracts to produce critical medical supplies include small and medium businesses. Murphy has heard from a number of manufacturers in Connecticut who are eager to aid our nation’s response to this pandemic through the Defense Production Act and other related procurement programs. 
·    Senator Murphy recognized CT BioTech as this month’s “Innovator of the Month.” Founded during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic by TicketNetwork founder and CEO Don Vaccaro, CT BioTech’s mission is to provide safer, more comfortable, and less expensive personal protective equipment (PPE) supply options in response to the overwhelming demand and resulting price spikes.

2/26/21 16:33,Washington in a Week - Faith in the people means freedom.,"￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ ￼ 
￼
Faith in the government means tyranny. Faith in the people means freedom.
The past year has brought trying times for nation, exposing and deepening rifts of division and disagreement about a path forward. But if there is one thing that all of us should unite around, it is this: skepticism of government, and faith in the people. 
Because faith in the government – in imperfect, human rule and in the collective, coercive, authorized use of force – means tyranny. Faith in the people means freedom. 
This understanding is at the heart of our Constitution, which protects our freedom in two main ways. 
The first way is through the structural protections, or the checks and balances designed to disperse and limit the power of the federal government, while putting that power as much as possible in the hands of the people. And the second way is through the Bill of Rights: a separate list of “thou shalt nots,” or things that government simply cannot do, with the purpose of safeguarding individual liberty. 
The Founders knew from sad experience under British tyranny that bad things happen when excessive power accumulates in the hands of the few… and in the hands of those who are not skeptical of, and who put their trust in, government. When fallible human beings wield that kind of power, they inevitably do bad things with it. 
They restrict people’s speech. They restrict people’s ability to preach and live according to their religious beliefs, and to petition the government seeking relief from abusive actions by that government. They disarm the populace. They unreasonably search and seize individuals, their homes, and personal effects, without warrant. 
And so as a country, we made a choice with the Bill of Rights: a choice to prevent that kind of tyranny and to protect the freedoms we hold most dear, as only “We the People” can. The Founders understood that ultimately, the bulwark of individual liberty must lie with the people themselves. 
The freedoms and protections guaranteed to us by the Founders are precisely what I strive to defend as I represent Utahns in the United States Senate. I believe we ought to be skeptical of government, and have faith in the American people. The government should work for us – not the other way around. 
That is something worth uniting around, and worth fighting for. Together, I believe we can. 
 
Holding Big Tech accountable with the PROMISE Act (S.427)
￼
The billionaires who own our nation’s Big Tech companies have every right to be partisan political actors. They do not have the right to tell consumers that they will provide unbiased platforms, and then use those same platforms to discriminate against Americans with opposing religious, philosophical, or political viewpoints. 
Fighting to ensure that Utah families are treated fairly by our tax code. 
￼
The Lee-Rubio plan would help address the parent penalty by nearly doubling the Child Tax Credit. The plan would also eliminate the stay-at-home parent penalty by turning the childcare credit into a “young child” enhancement that families of all stripes can access. We must ensure that Utah families are treated fairly by our tax code. 
 
What's happening in Utah
Members of my staff spent the week in the Uinta Basin meeting with community leaders, local businesses, and hundreds of Utahns from many communities, including Duchesne, Roosevelt, Vernal, and Manila. I wanted to highlight two of the many meetings that took place this week. 
￼
My staff met with veterans of the American Legion in Vernal and were able to address their concerns regarding healthcare and treatment at the VA. Utah is blessed to have true patriots such as these, and we are indebted to them for their service. 
￼
My staff met with local energy producers and heard their concerns regarding President Biden’s recent executive orders on oil and gas drilling. Energy production is crucial to the economy of the Uinta Basin and provides thousands of good paying jobs.

Removing nuclear launch powers from President Biden would be 'wildly unconstitutional'
""Look, there is one argument or another with regard to whether or to what extent we ought to be involved in foreign conflicts at any moment. One could have one opinion or another about at what point it is appropriate for Congress to declare war rather than have the president order discreet strikes. The fact is the president is the commander-in-chief of the armed forces.
This is why we subject presidents to a very rigorous review process. That is they have to win elections. Once they’ve won an election you really do have to pick that horse and then ride it. You’ve gotta let the president be the commander-in-chief... 
This seems really weird to me that they’d take that away - and by the way, who are they going to give that power to? They’re gonna give that to a committee? In addition to being wildly unconstitutional, this would be a horrible policy.""   Click here to read the full article

February 26, 2021



Dear Friend,



This week, I was pleased to announce the passage of H.R. 208, To designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 500 West Main Street, Tupelo, Mississippi, as the ""Colonel Carlyle 'Smitty' Harris Post Office."" The bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in a recorded vote in the U.S. House of Representatives. The next step in the process requires a U.S. Senator to introduce a companion bill in the Senate.







Colonel Harris's F-105 fighter-bomber was shot down over North Vietnam on April 4, 1965. He was the sixth American to become a Prisoner of War at the Hoa Lo Prison, also known as the ""Hanoi Hilton.""  During eight years of captivity, Col. Harris employed the tap code to communicate with his fellow prisoners. Despite the constant threat of torture, he taught other prisoners how to use the secret code. 







After a 29-year career in the U.S. Air Force, Col. Harris retired to the town that took such great care of his wife, Louise, and their three children - Tupelo. After completing law school, he joined the Mississippi Bar Association in 1981. Col. Harris's accomplishments are many, yet he remains a humble man.  



This week, I had the opportunity to speak on the House Floor about Col. Harris - a man I am honored to call a friend. To watch the video, please click on the link.







 
 
GOLD STAR FAMILY FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM
 


In October 2019, I was proud to receive the support of my colleagues through the passage of Sergeant First Class Sean Cooley and Specialist Christopher Horton Congressional Gold Star Family Fellowship Program. The legislation established a twelve-month, fully-funded fellowship in a Congressional office for siblings, spouses, or children of service members who have lost their lives in service to America.







Frayser Hawkins, a U.S. Navy Veteran and native of New Albany, is the first Gold Star family member to be selected for the fellowship. He is an excellent advocate for Gold Star families. His distinguished military career, coupled with a love for God and Country, will play an essential role as we formulate meaningful legislation on their behalf. ""I am thankful for this opportunity to advocate for Gold Star families, including my own,"" Frayser said. 







On December 14, 2005, Corporal Michael Brandon Presley, Frayser's brother, died from wounds sustained while conducting combat operations in Fallujah, Iraq. Frayser said he and his brother were close friends with a great deal in common, including their proud commitment to serving America in the U.S. Armed Forces. Frayser said that Brandon joined the U.S. Marine Corps not long after 911. ""I want to honor my brother's memory by giving back. This fellowship is a way to make sure we can do all that we can for Gold Star families. There are things that we can do on Capitol Hill for those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice and their families,"" Frayser said. 



 
 
ACTIONS IN THE HOUSE
 


Gold Star Altitude Act



This week, Rep. Tim Ryan (OH-13) and I proudly introduced the “Gold Star Altitude Act.” This bill will allow Gold Star family members to use travel benefits to fly on military aircraft when there is available space to select locations.



The Space Available travel program is a military benefit that allows active and retired members of the Armed Forces to travel on military aircrafts to select locations when unused space remain open on the aircraft. While families of the active and retired family enjoy this benefit, Gold Star families – families who lost their servicemember while actively serving our country - have not been included in the benefit. When someone pays the ultimate sacrifice in the defense of America, the least we can do is ensure their family enjoy the same benefit as those who are currently serving or retired from service. I’m extremely proud of this legislation, and I’m looking forward to working with my colleagues to see that it is signed into law.

 
 
SERVICE ACADEMY BOUND - BEN WILLIAMS
 


As your First District Representative, it is an honor to nominate young people to attend one of America's prestigious service academies. Our first appointment for 2021 is Ben Williams, an Alcorn Central High School senior. He is an outstanding student who has distinguished himself in and out of the classroom. Ben has devoted himself to numerous civic organizations and community service projects. Additionally, he has excelled in athletics - all great examples of leadership skills. 







Ben received an appointment to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He is interested in studying civil engineering while attaining the skills necessary to serve as an officer in the U.S. Armed Forces. Ben is the son of Frank and Leanne Williams. He said his father influenced his decision. ""My father is a pastor and always said to find someone to serve,"" Ben said. ""I wanted to go as far as I can in life. Service to my Country represents everything that I wanted to achieve.""

CC Issue
 
Lindsey,



TAXPAYER ALERT: Democrats in Washington are scamming the American people into believing that their $1.9 trillion spending spree is aimed at addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. The reality is that only 9 percent of this spending bill goes toward public health. If the latest bailout is enacted, the price tag for all “pandemic-related” stimulus spending will saddle every American with more than $17,000 in debt.



Meanwhile, of the $4 trillion in bipartisan relief already appropriated by Congress, $1 trillion has yet to be spent. Democrats in Washington are exploiting the pandemic to justify spending that has nothing to do with restoring our way of life, and only compounds our mounting national debt. 

 
 
 	
Should Congress approve another $1.9 trillion stimulus package while $1 trillion from previous packages remains unspent?

 
 
 	
No. This level of spending is out of control.
 
 
 	
Yes. I trust the government will spend my money only on essential priorities.
 
 
 	
None of the above.
 
 
 
Submit survey to sign up for updates on my work in Congress.*

Amid the crazed liberal spending spree this week on Capitol Hill, Democrats declined several Balderson-backed common-sense amendments, including:

Prioritizing the critical, unmet needs of rural communities and small businesses
Prohibiting payments to companies owned by the Chinese Communist Party
Preventing the President from unilaterally banning hydraulic fracturing
Blocking taxpayer money from paying for elective abortions
Ensuring that K-12 funding is tied to the reopening of schools for in-person learning 
Stopping arbitrary federal minimum wage hikes from destroying small businesses
Cracking down on intellectual property theft from the Chinese Communist Party at our colleges and universities
Prohibiting taxpayer funding to groups that promote the boycott, divestment, and sanctions (BDS) against Israel
Setting aside at least 5 percent of the Child Care Stabilization Fund for addressing needs in rural communities
What They’re Not Telling You:

51 percent of the most recent Paycheck Protection Program funding remains unspent
The Congressional Budget Office already projects the economy to return to pre-pandemic level of real GDP growth by mid-2021
After stimulus checks, 45 percent of the money will not be spent until next year, including 95 percent of the funding for reopening schools
The proposed expansion of unemployment insurance would mean that more than half of Americans would earn more from unemployment benefits than from paychecks

2/26/21 17:44,Senator Bennet’s Weekly Update,"
A message from Senator Michael Bennet

Image
Hello everyone, 

I’m glad to report some real progress this week for Colorado. Today, the House of Representatives passed the CORE Act, my bill with Congressman Neguse to protect over 400,000 acres of public lands in our state. Soon, we also expect it to pass the American Rescue Plan, a historic relief package to help us overcome the virus and safely reopen the country.

You can draw a straight line from many details of the package and my discussions across Colorado. Over the past year, I made a point to visit all 64 counties in our state to hear directly from people about their challenges during the pandemic and what they’d like to see out of Washington. I heard from nurses and frontline staff working around the clock without enough support; teachers who were in tears because they’re doing everything they can but see their students falling behind; parents worried about feeding their families because they lost their jobs in a bar, restaurant, or seasonal industry; and small business owners weeks away from closing their doors forever. The message was consistent: people need help.

Image
Fortunately, help is on the way. The new relief package includes my proposal to expand the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit, which would boost incomes for hundreds of thousands of working families in Colorado and cut child poverty nationwide by 45 percent in a single year. It invests nearly $8 billion to surge our public health capacity at the local level, consistent with my proposal with Senator Gillibrand to create a Health Force. And it provides much needed relief to state and local governments and the hardest hit small businesses, which I’ve been urging for months.

I wish Congress had acted on these ideas months ago, but I am optimistic the Senate will get this done next week and deliver for Colorado and the country in our moment of need.

Thanks for making the time to read this newsletter and please share your views with our team.

Have a great weekend,

Michael

Iran Nuclear Verification Act
This week, I introduced the Iran Nuclear Verification Act. A nuclear Iran is a threat to the safety of the entire world, and we must not allow them to achieve their goal. President Biden's decision to reengage Iran on the flawed Iran Nuclear Deal will lead to a nuclear armed Iran within 10 years. My legislation would require Iran to be in full compliance with the original terms of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action before the U.S. even approaches the table. This includes allowing UN nuclear inspectors full access to every nuclear site and the UN nuclear inspectors finishing their comprehensive report on Iran's nuclear activities.

 Lapeer County Community Engagement
Recently, I had the opportunity to address the Lapeer County Community Collaborative in their virtual legislative town hall. I gave a Congressional update and explained what I have been up to in my first seven weeks in office. I'm humbled everyday I get to serve our community.

 Pushing back at Communist China
Last week, the House Armed Services Committee held a hearing titled, the Department of Defense's Evolving Roles and Mission in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic. Fighting this pandemic is vital to the success of our country, but we cannot allow it to stop us from pushing back on communist China. The Chinese Communist Party is the number one threat to the United States and the world. 
I was pleased to hear  Michigan State University is closing its Confucius Institute. The Chinese Communist Party has planted these institutes into our universities and campuses to spread their propaganda. We must continue the tough approach that President Trump began and ensure China is not allowed to continue its influence throughout the world. 
Tax Returns
The IRS has officially begun accepting tax returns for the 2020 filing year. If you didn't receive either of your stimulus checks, but qualified for them, you have the opportunity to file for a Recovery Rebate Credit. The IRS has stopped sending out stimulus checks. The tax filing deadline is April 15, so be sure to file soon.

Foxx Report
 
I’m thankful every day for the countless men and women who stand watch over the southern border, and I firmly believe they deserve our profound gratitude every day. Dedicating one’s career to defending this great country, in any capacity, is truly inspiring. Now, protecting America’s borders is not an issue that’s here one day and gone the next. It’s the issue of a lifetime. Generations of Americans to come deserve to live in a country that is protected, and not one that’s left vulnerable due to lopsided policy agendas. Sadly, it seems that imperative holds no weight in the current administration, and it’s downright shameful. 
Unfortunately, most of the news on the Biden Administration’s recent assault on border security has shifted to the back pages of popular newspapers and online, and I believe that you should know what’s at stake and the real implications of what’s being done. Recently, President Joe Biden reinstituted former President Obama’s controversial catch and release policy that allows illegal immigrants who were deported back into the United States even after it was proven to be a flawed approach to curbing illegal immigration. He then went on to sign Executive Orders that would stop new border wall construction in its tracks – significantly halting the progress that had been achieved under President Trump. And, if things weren’t bad enough already, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers face a new policy that will hinder them in deporting immigrants who are accused of heinous crimes and felonies. This isn’t border security, it’s handing out “get-out-of-jail-free” cards as if they were candy. 
My Republican colleagues and I are deeply troubled by what’s happening, and we will continue to fight against the radical border insecurity policies that Joe Biden wants to champion. The American people deserve protection, and we won’t let up until that’s achieved. 
What’s Lurking In The Newest “Relief” Bill?
There’s more to the newest “relief” bill that’s being rammed through Congress than meets the eye, and you deserve to know what’s in it. I’ve heard from so many constituents who are outright concerned that this bill fails to meet the mark on a multitude of levels, and they’re correct. Only nine percent of the funding in this bill is focused on defeating COVID-19.  It’s time for the facts to be put front and center. Here are just a few concerning components that come to mind: 
	•	This bill creates a new federally mandated minimum wage that would result in 1.4 million jobs lost, and younger Americans with less formal education will be hardest hit.  
	•	This bill allows funding to go to colleges that have partnerships with companies that are owned or controlled by communist China.  
	•	This bill provides $50 million in funding for EPA environmental justice grants, a thinly veiled kickback to leftist environmental groups.  
	•	This bill crowds out small businesses with the most need for additional PPP funding by expanding eligibility to large, affiliated nonprofits, labor unions, country clubs, fraternities and sororities and publicly traded internet news organizations.  
Click here to find out the full extent of what’s included in this so-called “relief” package.  
My Latest Op-Ed In The Washington Times 
Recently I joined my colleague, Representative Kay Granger (R-TX), a former educator and current Republican Leader of the House Committee on Appropriations, in penning an op-ed that appeared in the Washington Times about reopening schools safely. I highly encourage you to read the article as we lay out the case for why students have been robbed of their educational pursuits for over a year. As former educators, we understand the importance of not only student success in the classroom, but also how students grow and prosper alongside their peers. If school closures continue, we will see lasting negative effects for our nation’s children. Instead of adhering to the fear-mongering tactics of unions, let’s follow the science — by reopening schools now.  
Quote of The Week
“No man can be truly free whose liberty is dependent upon the thought, feeling and action of others, and who has himself no means in his own hands for guarding, protecting, defending and maintaining that liberty” 
-Frederick Douglass

Sen. Rick Scott: UN Human Rights Council Decision to Host Maduro is Unforgivable 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following the decision by the United Nations Human Rights Council to include Nicolas Maduro as a speaker at its forty-sixth regular session in Geneva.     Senator Rick Scott said, “The UN Human Rights Council has been a joke ever since its decision to allow Maduro, who is committing a genocide against the people of Venezuela, to be a member. Now, they are taking it even further and giving Maduro an open platform to spew his hate and propaganda. I travelled to Cúcuta to visit the Venezuelan border and saw the devastation firsthand. Venezuelan children walking for hours through dense forest, across rivers and over terrorist-controlled territory just to get to a school in Colombia for an education and a meal. Mothers with young children coming to Cúcuta to get the only meal they’d eat for three days. It’s horrific. The UN Human Rights Council should have the words ‘human rights’ stripped from its title, and explain its decision to the millions of Venezuelans suffering under Maduro’s regime.   ""Maduro’s invitation to speak should be rescinded immediately. If not, every freedom-loving nation in attendance should walk out. In the meantime, the U.S. must closely examine our relationship with the UN. American taxpayer dollars should not be used to prop up dangerous dictators, and no more funding should go to the UN until this decision is explained.” Read more HERE.

 Senador Rick Scott: La decisión del Consejo de Derechos Humanos de la ONU de recibir a Maduro como orador es imperdonable 
El Senador Rick Scott hizo la siguiente declaración tras la decisión del Consejo de Derechos Humanos de las Naciones Unidas de incluir a Nicolás Maduro como orador en su cuadragésima sexta sesión ordinaria, que comienza mañana en Ginebra.  El Senador Rick Scott dijo: “El Consejo de Derechos Humanos de la ONU se ha convertido en un farsa desde su decisión de permitir que Maduro, quien está cometiendo genocidio contra el pueblo de Venezuela, sea miembro del Consejo. Ahora, lo están llevando más lejos y le han dado a Maduro una plataforma abierta para propagar su mensaje de odio. Viajé a Cúcuta para visitar la frontera con Venezuela y vi la devastación de primera mano. Niños venezolanos caminando por horas a través de bosques densos, ríos y territorios controlados por terroristas para llegar a una escuela en Colombia y recibir educación y comida. Madres con niños pequeños que vienen a Cúcuta para obtener la única comida que comerían durante tres días. Es muy triste. El Consejo de Derechos Humanos de la ONU debería eliminar las palabras “derechos humanos” de su título y explicar su decisión a los millones de venezolanos que sufren bajo el régimen de Maduro.   ""La invitación de Maduro como orador de esta sesión debe ser revocada de inmediato. Si no, todas las naciones proponentes de la libertad deben abandonar la sesión. Mientras tanto, los Estados Unidos debe examinar de cerca nuestra relación con la ONU. Los dólares de los contribuyentes americanos no deben usarse para apoyar a dictadores peligrosos, y no se deben destinar más fondos a la ONU hasta que den una explicación por esta decision”. Lea más AQUÍ.

 Sen. Rick Scott: The Biden Administration Must Hold the UN Accountable  
Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after the United Nations Human Rights Council’s decision to include Nicolas Maduro, a murderous dictator, as a speaker during its 46th Session this week.  Senator Rick Scott said, “Time and time again I have called out the United Nations’ (UN) hypocrisy for allowing oppressive regimes like Cuba, Venezuela and Communist China to have a seat at a council that is supposed to stand for human rights. The UN has continuously given a platform to dictators like Nicolas Maduro, who jail dissidents, strip citizens of their basic rights and starve their own people. It’s time that the Biden Administration gets serious about our commitment to freedom and democracy and hold the UN accountable.    “President Biden and Linda Thomas-Greenfield, his UN Ambassador nominee, must immediately call on to the UN to rescind Venezuela’s seat at the table and refuse to participate in any session that provides a platform to murderous dictators. They also need to rethink their decision to rejoin the disastrous UN Human Rights Council. All funding to the UN should be suspended until we can reassure American taxpayers that they are not funding an organization that turns a blind eye to the atrocities perpetrated by these regimes. Today, the Senate will vote on whether to proceed with Nominee Thomas-Greenfield’s confirmation. Should the Administration stay silent on this today, I urge my colleagues to strongly consider that cowardice as they vote. It’s time for the United States to unapologetically stand for human rights and hold all who don’t fully accountable."" Read more HERE.

Senador Rick Scott: La Administración Biden debe responsabilizar a la ONU 
El Senador Rick Scott hizo la siguiente declaración luego de la decisión del Consejo de Derechos Humanos de las Naciones Unidas de incluir a Nicolás Maduro, un dictador asesino, como orador durante su 46° sesión esta semana.  El Senador Rick Scott dijo: “Una y otra vez he denunciado la hipocresía de las Naciones Unidas (ONU) por permitir que regímenes opresores como Cuba, Venezuela y la China comunista tengan un asiento en un consejo que se supone que defiende los derechos humanos. La ONU le ha otorgado una plataforma a dictadores como Nicolás Maduro, que encarcela disidentes, despoja a los ciudadanos de sus derechos básicos y mata de hambre a su propia gente. Es hora de que la Administración Biden tome en serio nuestro compromiso con la libertad y la democracia y haga que la ONU rinda cuentas.   ""El Presidente Biden y Linda Thomas-Greenfield, su nominada a embajadora de la ONU, deben pedirle inmediatamente a la ONU que rescinda el asiento de Venezuela en el consejo y se nieguen a participar en cualquier sesión que brinde una plataforma a dictadores asesinos. También necesitan repensar su decisión de unirse nuevamente al desastroso Consejo de Derechos Humanos de la ONU. Todos los fondos para la ONU deben suspenderse hasta que podamos asegurarle a los contribuyentes americanos que no están financiando a una organización que ignora las atrocidades perpetradas por estos regímenes. Hoy, el Senado votará por la confirmación de la nominada Thomas-Greenfield. Si la Administración guarda silencio sobre este tema, insto a mis colegas a que consideren seriamente esta señal de cobardía mientras votan en el día de hoy. Es hora de que los Estados Unidos defienda los derechos humanos y responsabilice aquellos que no lo hagan.” Lea más AQUÍ.

Sens. Rick Scott, Kyrsten Sinema Announce Fly Safe Canine COVID Detection Act 
Senators Rick Scott and Kyrsten Sinema announced the Fly Safe Canine COVID Detection Act, which directs the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to conduct a feasibility study on the use of canine units to screen airport travelers for COVID-19.   Senator Rick Scott said, “As Americans begin traveling more, we have to ensure families are safe. We’ve seen reports that dogs can be effective in detecting COVID-19, and having canine units could provide an important additional level of screening at our airports. I’m proud to join Senator Sinema today to announce legislation directing TSA to conduct a feasibility study on the use of canine units, and will keep working to make sure Americans can travel safely.” Read more HERE. 
— 
Sen. Rick Scott: Fed Chairman Jay Powell Must Address Rising Inflation 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell’s testimony before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.   Senator Rick Scott said, “For months, I have been warning my colleagues and others about the dangers associated with our rising and unsustainable $27 trillion national debt. America’s debt crisis hurts our citizens in many ways but the most immediate problem it creates is a rise in inflation, which disproportionately hurts America’s low and fixed-income families, like mine growing up.   ""While I have been clear on the need for immediate action and spending reform, my Democrat colleagues as well as Chairman Powell and the Biden Administration continue to blindly disregard this incredibly urgent matter. In fact, President Biden, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and others are arguing against the data and saying we must plunge our nation deeper into debt with no explanation of the benefit or how we’ll actually pay for it.   “There are strong indications and projections from economists on both sides of the aisle that inflation will rise. When inflation rises, even marginally, the cost of goods goes up. That means families will pay more for essential goods like gas and groceries. American families cannot be put on the hook for the government’s wasteful spending. Today, Chairman Powell must outline his plan to ensure this doesn’t happen and show how he and the Federal Reserve will properly address the threat our national debt poses to our economy, and families and business across the nation."" Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott on USDA Nominee Tom Vilsack: We Can’t Go Back to Obama-Era Cuba Appeasement Policies 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following his vote against the confirmation of Tom Vilsack to lead the U.S. Department of Agriculture.   Senator Rick Scott said, “While I appreciate Tom Vilsack’s commitment to supporting Florida’s growers and agriculture industry, I cannot support any nominee that encouraged Obama-era appeasement and open-trade policies with Cuba. We’ve made significant progress to hold the Cuban regime accountable over the past four years and deny them sources of revenue. Under no circumstances can the United States go back to supporting this murderous regime. We know appeasement policies and open-trade do nothing to help the Cuban people in their fight for freedom and democracy and that any revenue to the Cuban regime goes to enrich corrupt communist oppressors. Cuba is the root of the evil we see in Latin America and we must continue to fight until we see a new day of freedom in our hemisphere.”  Read more HERE.

El Senador Rick Scott sobre el nominado del USDA, Tom Vilsack: No podemos volver a las políticas de apaciguamiento hacia Cuba de la era Obama 
El Senador Rick Scott hizo la siguiente declaración luego de su voto en contra de la confirmación de Tom Vilsack para dirigir el Departamento de Agricultura de EE. UU.   El Senador Rick Scott dijo: “Si bien aprecio el compromiso de Tom Vilsack de apoyar a los productores y la industria agrícola de la Florida, no puedo apoyar a ningún nominado que apoye las políticas de apaciguamiento y comercio abierto de la era de Obama con Cuba. Hemos hecho avances significativos para responsabilizar al régimen cubano durante los últimos cuatro años y negarle fuentes de ingresos al régimen. Los Estados Unidos no pueden, bajo ninguna circunstancia, volver a apoyar a este régimen asesino. Sabemos que las políticas de apaciguamiento y el comercio abierto no ayudan al pueblo cubano en su lucha por la libertad y la democracia y que cualquier ingreso del régimen cubano se destina a enriquecer a los opresores comunistas. Cuba es la raíz de la maldad que vemos en América Latina y debemos seguir luchando hasta que veamos un nuevo día de libertad en nuestro hemisferio."" Lea más AQUÍ.

Sen. Rick Scott Slams Biden Proposal to Raise Taxes 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following reports of President Biden’s plan to increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. Estimates show that President Biden’s proposal would kill 159,000 jobs, reduce long-run economic output and reduce wages.   Senator Rick Scott said, “President Biden does not care about getting people back to work, spurring economic growth or helping American families and businesses thrive. Biden’s disastrous plan to increase the corporate tax rate by more than 30 percent will have devastating impacts on American families and businesses. His plan will kill 159,000 jobs. That’s 159,000 opportunities stolen from American families. I grew up in a poor family and I watched my parents struggle to find work. I know the value of a job. Biden’s agenda doesn’t make any sense. Now is not the time to attack our job creators.   “With every one of these bad policies, President Biden hands a victory to Communist China and our other adversaries. The Biden Administration needs to end its job-killing war on the American economy and focus on making the U.S. more competitive and attractive to businesses and manufacturers.” Read more HERE.

Sens. Rick Scott and Maria Cantwell Re-Introduce Fly Safe and Healthy Act to Protect Against Spread of COVID-19 
Senators Rick Scott and Maria Cantwell re-introduced the Fly Safe and Healthy Act to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 by launching a pilot program to require temperature checks at TSA screenings for air travelers.   Senator Rick Scott said, “Florida is a huge tourism state, and thousands of families rely on the success of the industry. To get our economy back on track and fully re-opened, Americans need to trust that they can travel safely. The Fly Safe and Healthy Act will enable a temperature check pilot program to ensure passengers with a fever don’t board a plane and put other passengers and airline employees at risk. It also requires airlines to work with a customer to reschedule or cancel their flight if they’re experiencing a fever, and establishes consumer protections to guard against unfair pricing tactics. I’ve been calling for temperature checks for passengers of mass travel since the beginning of the pandemic as a common-sense measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and I urge my colleagues to pass this bipartisan bill immediately."" Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott, Sen. Tom Cotton and Colleagues Introduce Bill to End China’s Access to Multi-Year Visas 
Senator Rick Scott joined Senator Tom Cotton and colleagues to introduce the Visa Security Act to end Communist China’s access to 10-year multi-entry visas.  Senator Rick Scott said, “The Obama/Biden appeasement of Communist China did nothing but bolster General Secretary Xi’s power. We know Communist China will stop at nothing to steal American technology and intellectual property in an attempt to dominate the world. There is no reason Communist China should have been given preferential visa treatment, and I’m proud to work with my colleagues to continue to hold them accountable.” Read more from Senator Cotton’s office HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott to Biden Administration: Do Not Approve Release of Funds to Iranian Regime 
Senator Scott released a statement following reports that the Biden Administration is considering approving the release of $1 billion from Iranian bank accounts in South Korea which are currently frozen by U.S. sanctions.    Senator Rick Scott said, “Iran cannot be trusted. The Iranian regime is the world’s largest state-sponsor of terror, and under no circumstance should the U.S. consider easing or undermining sanctions so that Iran can have more funds to build up their nuclear facilities and further destabilize the Middle East. President Biden and Secretary Blinken’s message on behalf of the United States must be crystal clear: Until Iran fully cooperates and its nuclear program is eliminated, there will not be any changes to sanctions or access granted to these funds.” Read more HERE.

Fox News: Rick Scott calls for Biden’s ‘immediate attention’ on moving 2022 Olympics from China 
Senator Rick Scott is requesting to meet with President Joe Biden to discuss the horrific human rights atrocities occurring across Communist China and the Senator’s continued calls for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to select a new site for the 2022 Winter Olympics Games.   See more from Fox News HERE or in the Fox News article, Rick Scott calls for Biden’s ‘immediate attention’ on moving 2022 Olympics from China, below:   ""Republican Sen. Rick Scott is requesting a meeting with President Biden and calling for his ’immediate attention’ to moving the 2022 Winter Olympic Games out of Beijing, citing China’s human rights abuses.   Scott, R-Fla., said ’the horrific human rights abuses perpetrated by China’s communist government against its own people cannot be ignored.'   'Under no circumstance should the global community give Communist China an international platform to whitewash its crimes, which is what will happen if they are allowed to host the 2022 Olympic Games in Beijing,’ Scott wrote in a letter.   Scott has repeatedly urged the International Olympic Committee to move the games out of China and to a country ‘that respects basic human rights.’   ... Scott pointed that ’more than one million Uyghurs are detained in concentration camps designed to erase their religious and ethnic cultural identities,” and in Hong Kong, “the Chinese Communist Party has worked to strip away the civil liberties of more than five million people.’   ... But Scott said he wanted ‘to make very clear that the United States cannot simply boycott the games.'   … Scott said that working together, he and the president could ‘seize this opportunity to show that America is the world’s greatest supporter of freedom, democracy and human rights for all, while preserving the marvel that is and must always be so perfectly captured by the unity created by the Olympic Games.'   Scott earlier this month also introduced a resolution in the Senate calling on the International Olympic Committee to move the 2022 Winter Olympics out of China and rebid it to another country unless Beijing ‘immediately addresses its egregious and numerous violations of human rights.'""

Greetings,
House Democrats have a special way with words when it comes to crafting legislation. This week, they have held a vote on the Equality Act and will hold a vote on a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package. On the surface, these bills sound like positive, helpful pieces of legislation. The reality is these bills are packed full with partisan items on Democrats' wish lists.
I voted no on the Equality Act because it tears down religious liberty and does not, in fact, create equal opportunity for men and women. The Equality Act dramatically expands abortion access by creating a new definition of “sex.” This bill will require schools to allow biological males to play in female sports, apply for female targeted scholarships, and stay in female domestic violence shelters. It is very plausible that the Equality Act will eliminate doctor’s ability to deny an abortion based on conscience and nullify the Hyde Amendment, which bans tax dollars from funding abortions. These ideas should not become federal law.
The COVID-19 relief package has a significant price tag of $1.9 trillion. Only 9% of the funds in this COVID-19 relief package will go toward public health and only 1% will further vaccine distribution. So where is the rest of the money in this bill going? Included in this ""COVID relief"" bill is an allocation of PPP funds to Planned Parenthood, $112 million to Speaker Pelosi's Silicon Valley Tunnel, and paid leave for only federal workers. Last I checked, none of these spending items have anything to do with COVID-19 relief.
Until next week,
￼

It is FFA Week! FFA does a fantastic job investing in its members and creating great leaders for Arkansas. FFA also gave me first glimpse into politics back when I was a member in my high school years. I look forward to seeing the FFA students in DC again when it is safe to do so!


Celebrating National Engineers Week
Engineering comes in all shapes and sizes, especially across Arkansas’ Fourth District. In my work as an engineer, I designed different mills, including many saw mills across the state. We are also home to chemical plants like Ingevity, which I toured virtually this year, and Standard Lithium. I can’t forget to mention the dozens of locks, dams and levees that would not function properly if it weren’t for the engineers behind them. The list could go on and on! Thank you to all of Arkansas’ engineers who make our communities so great.
￼
In 2019 I toured several locks and dams across the district. These infrastructures on our waterways make it possible for Arkansas to transport goods on our rivers and manage lakes for recreation. Without engineers this would not be possible!
￼
I got my start in engineering designing saw mills. One of my favorite memories over the years in Congress is the 2016 ""Seed to Sawmill"" tour Sen. Boozman and I hosted across the Fourth District. I hope to get to more of these facilities this year!

BROADBAND 
Take a Speed Test Here. 
The sad fact is that many places in West Virginia simply do not have access to reliable broadband and the lack of access affects West Virginians every day. Back in 2015, the FCC released a coverage map that stated 99.9% of Americans had wireless coverage. I knew then what I know now: That is just plain wrong. 
From the Hill to the Mountains
MANCHIN, SULLIVAN REINTRODUCE BIPARTISAN BILL TO ADDRESS VETERANS’ BURN PIT EXPOSURE  Charleston, WV – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Dan Sullivan (R-AK), members of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, reintroduced the Veterans Burn Pit Exposure Recognition Act, which will address a barrier currently preventing many Veterans from getting U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) healthcare and benefits for illnesses and diseases related to exposure to burn pits. The bill would recognize and concede their exposure during deployed service. Notably, the bill would not automatically grant benefits or healthcare to Veterans who served near a burn pit, nor would it create a presumption of service connection, like Agent Orange. 
MANCHIN LEADS BIPARTISAN PUSH FOR SECURE RURAL SCHOOLS PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION  Washington, DC –  Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) led 19 Senators in a bipartisan push for reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program to ensure counties across America do not lose out on essential services due to federal land ownership. The program, which helps fund essential services in rural communities home to federal land, expired in September 2020; the last payment under the current authorization is scheduled for April 2021, less than two months from now. 
MANCHIN, CAPITO LEAD COLLEAGUES IN DESIGNATING PUBLIC SCHOOLS WEEK IN FEBRUARY  Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) led 37 Senators in introducing a bipartisan resolution to designate the week of February 22nd, 2021 as Public Schools Week, which passed the Senate unanimously. The Public Schools Week resolution celebrates the critical role public schools play in their communities and encourages state, local and federal lawmakers to prioritize efforts to strengthen public education, bolster services that provide critical support for students, including counseling, extracurricular activities, and mental health resources and urges Congress support efforts to advance equal opportunities for all students. 
MANCHIN, COLLINS INTRODUCE BIPARTISAN BILL TO HELP DISABLED VETERANS PURCHASE ADAPTIVE AUTOMOBILES  The average cost of a new adaptive vehicle that disabled Veterans need to drive safely and maintain their independence ranges from $40,000 to $65,000  Washington, DC – U.S. Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Susan Collins (R-ME) introduced bipartisan legislation that would reduce the financial burden for disabled Veterans who require special adaptive equipment to drive a motor vehicle. The Advancing Uniform Transportation Opportunities (AUTO) for Veterans Act would make these Veterans eligible to receive a grant to help purchase a new adaptive vehicle once every ten years, helping them to drive safely and maintain their independence. 
MANCHIN APPLAUDS WEST VIRGINIA POWER DECISION TO JOIN ATLANTIC LEAGUE OF PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) applauded the decision by West Virginia Power to join the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball for the 2021 season. Since November 2019, Senator Manchin has worked tirelessly to protect West Virginia’s baseball teams after the restructuring of Minor League Baseball (MiLB) over the last year. 
Energy Committee News
MANCHIN WILL VOTE TO CONFIRM HAALAND  Washington, DC – Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, released the following statement on his decision to vote to confirm Representative Deb Haaland to serve as Secretary of the Department of the Interior.   “Given the political divisions currently facing our country, I believe that every Presidential nominee and every Member of Congress must be committed to a new era of bipartisanship. That is the standard the overwhelming majority of Americans expect and deserve.  With respect to Representative Haaland and her confirmation hearing, while we do not agree on every issue, she reaffirmed her strong commitment to bipartisanship, addressing the diverse needs of our country and maintaining our nation’s energy independence. Her colleagues on both sides of the aisle, including Republican Congressman Don Young from the energy rich state of Alaska, spoke to their productive working relationship, her bipartisan accomplishments and sincere willingness to work collaboratively on important issues. In addition, she reiterated the position of the Biden Administration that our country will continue to use fossil fuels for years to come, even as we transition to a cleaner energy future, through innovation not elimination. Further, she made clear her commitment to working to extend the critical Abandoned Mine Land fees set to expire this year that impact countless states.  For all these reasons, I believe Deb Haaland will be a Secretary of the Interior for every American and will vote to confirm her. I look forward to working with her to protect our public lands and ensure the responsible use of all our natural resources in a bipartisan manner."" 
MANCHIN, ENERGY COMMITTEE RECONVENE TO CONSIDER SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR NOMINEE  To watch a video of Senator Manchin’s questioning, please click here.   Washington, DC – Today, the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee reconvened to continue the hearing to consider the nomination of U.S. Representative Debra Haaland (D-NM) to be Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), Chairman of the Committee, highlighted the need to improve current pipeline permitting processes to help reduce methane emissions from public lands. 
MANCHIN PRAISES SENATE CONFIRMATION OF JENNIFER GRANHOLM TO BE SECRETARY OF ENERGY  To watch Chairman Manchin deliver remarks on the Senate floor, click here.   Washington, DC—Today, U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, praised the confirmation of Governor Jennifer Granholm to be Secretary of Energy, who was confirmed by a vote of 64-35.  ""Today I voted to confirm Governor Jennifer Granholm as Secretary of Energy. Governor Granholm has the leadership skills, the vision, and the compassion for people that we need at the helm of the Department of Energy to develop innovative solutions for the climate challenge, and at the same time, preserve our energy security, protect our national security, cleanup the Cold War legacy, and preserve our scientific and technological prowess. I have known Governor Granholm since we were governors together more than a decade ago, and I know from personal experience that she will work with and listen to members on both sides of the aisle on the issues critical to our nation. She is extremely well qualified to lead the Department, and during her confirmation hearing she committed to working with me to ensure that we don’t leave any workers behind as we move towards a cleaner energy future. I was pleased to support her nomination and look forward to working with her on the energy issues facing West Virginians and Americans everywhere.”

WORKING FOR YOU
MANCHIN, CARTWRIGHT LEAD BIPARTISAN COLLEAGUES IN CALLING ON ADMINISTRATION TO PROTECT MINERS FROM COVID-19 EXPOSURE  Washington, DC –  U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Representative Matt Cartwright (D-PA-8) led 13 Members of Congress in calling on the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) to issue immediate guidance to protect mine workers from exposure to COVID-19.  The Members said in part, ""Our brave and patriotic miners risk their lives every day to power our nation, and during the COVID-19 pandemic that risk is even greater. As they continue to work in close quarters and tough conditions, miners remain at high risk for COVID-19 infection. While miners have continued to work to supply our nation’s energy needs through the pandemic, under the previous Administration, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) has refused to issue an enforceable standard to protect workers from COVID-19 and has not taken emergency action to make our mines safer. As a result, we are requesting your immediate assistance to implement safety measures to ensure their health and safety.""  At the beginning of February, Senator Manchin and Representative Cartwright led the introduction of the bipartisan, bicameral COVID-19 Mine Worker Protection Act (S.184/HR.646) which would require the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) to issue an emergency temporary standard requiring mine operators to establish a plan to tackle occupational COVID-19 exposure and provide miners with the necessary personal protective equipment (PPE). Additional information on the COVID-19 Mine Worker Protection Act can be found here. 
  
MANCHIN: WEST VIRGINIA TO RECEIVE FIFTH INCREASE IN WEEKLY COVID-19 VACCINE ALLOCATION  Washington, DC –  U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) received notification that West Virginia will be receiving a fifth increase in the weekly vaccine allocation.  ""As national COVID-19 vaccine production increases, West Virginia continues to see increases in our dose allocation. I was notified this morning that West Virginia will receive another weekly increase of 3,510 Pfizer vaccine doses. This is the fifth consecutive dose increase West Virginia has received since the Biden Administration began pushing for production increases, and I am pleased West Virginia is continuing to benefit from these efforts,"" Senator Manchin said. ""West Virginia continues to lead the nation and the world in safe, effective vaccine distribution and administration. While we work to provide vaccines to every West Virginian who wants one, additional doses are essential. As vaccine production continues to increase and other vaccines are approved by the FDA, I will keep working with the Biden Administration to quickly procure more doses for the Mountain State."" 
  
MANCHIN QUESTIONS VETERANS AFFAIRS OFFICIALS ON COVID-19 VACCINATION DISTRIBUTION FOR VETERANS  Video of Senator Manchin during the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee Hearing On Vaccines For Veterans can be found here   Washington, DC –  U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), member of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee (SVAC), questioned a panel of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) officials on working with rural states to distribute COVID-19 vaccines and ensuring doses are not wasted, how the recent weather conditions affected the supply and distribution of the vaccine and how the VA is communicating and providing information to Veterans, especially in rural communities.

Supporting Granite Staters Struggling with Substance Misuse
While the COVID-19 pandemic has understandably dominated headlines during the last year, the substance misuse epidemic remains one of the largest public health and safety challenges for communities in New Hampshire and across the country.  In many ways, COVID-19 has exacerbated addiction and mental health challenges, and made it more difficult for people who are struggling to receive treatment.  This week, I questioned President Joe Biden’s nominees for key public health positions about the substance misuse crisis. We discussed the importance of reducing the stigma around addiction and supporting access to treatment.  You can watch my questioning here.   In an effort to help expand access to life-saving treatment, I introduced bipartisan legislation this week to help ensure that more Americans grappling with substance misuse have access to the medicine that they need to overcome their addiction.  The bipartisan Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment Act will vastly increase access to buprenorphine, an addiction treatment medicine that saves lives, by eliminating a duplicative bureaucratic hurdle currently blocking millions of highly trained health professionals from prescribing this medication to their patients.  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and the Biden administration to fix this issue once and for all, as well as continue working to expand resources for those struggling with substance misuse. 
With every good wish,  ￼   Senator Maggie Hassan 
What the Senator is Working On
This week, the U.S. Department of Labor announced that it is heeding Senator Hassan’s calls to fix a policy that has limited the ability of workers whose hours have been reduced or were temporarily laid off from receiving Pandemic Unemployment Assistance. Learn more here.  Senator Hassan also reintroduced bipartisan legislation to improve the Railroad Rehabilitation and Improvement Financing loan program, which is designed to provide direct loans to help develop passenger and short line railroads in New Hampshire and across the country. Learn more here.  Additionally, Senator Hassan reintroduced the DISCLOSE Act that would require organizations spending money in federal elections to disclose their donors and guard against hidden foreign influence in our democracy. Learn more here. 
Photo of the Week
Earlier this week, Senator Hassan met with President Biden as part of a bipartisan Congressional group that spoke with the President about U.S. supply chains. The group urged President Biden to take on China and reinvest in U.S. manufacturing. Later that day, the President signed an executive order initiating a review of domestic supply chains.

Dear Lindsey,

There was a common theme in many of the conversations and meetings I had this week. The American people are tired of Washington’s partisan fighting. People care about the issues, and they want to see us come together to achieve results. My work has been focused on building relationships to find areas of common ground. As your representative, I promise to keep building these relationships and finding ways to solve the issues you care about. At the end of the day, we are all Americans and need to remember to treat each other with respect and civility. 

I am also writing to you at the end of February, which is Black History Month. Our founders wrote ""all men are created equal"" in our Declaration of Independence, and the goal of equality is one our country has strived for since its founding. It is my hope that we continue to make progress toward this goal so that everyone can achieve their version of the American dream. 

I’ll be using this newsletter as a way to keep you up to date on my work on behalf of our Orange County community, so make sure you sign up for regular updates. You can also connect with my official Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages, where I’ll be posting the latest news and updates. 

Serving California's 48th District


Connecting with Local Businesses 
This week I had the opportunity to speak with the Huntington Beach Chamber of Commerce about the work I’m doing in Congress to help small businesses bounce back from the devastating pandemic. I answered their questions and cosponsored new legislation to support local restaurants following our conversation (more on that later on in this newsletter)! It’s always a pleasure to speak with our community’s business owners and job creators.
 

Supporting Reliable Water Infrastructure  
Californians know how important reliable water infrastructure is for our communities. That’s why this week I joined my California colleagues in voicing our support for the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation’s coordinated operations plan and the biological opinions that guided it. Delivering water to communities who need it, as well as improving water security, is critically important. Read more. 

Your Voice in DC 

Condemning AAPI Discrimination 
Hate crimes committed against Asian-American and Pacific Islanders have been on the rise since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Between March and December of last year, nearly 3,000 firsthand accounts of anti-Asian American and Pacific Islander hate crimes were recorded in the United States. This week I introduced a bipartisan resolution to condemn these crimes. Read more. 
 

Working for Targeted & Temporary COVID-19 Relief
Did you know that nearly $1 trillion of the COVID relief already passed by Congress remains unspent? COVID relief should be targeted, temporary, and tied to COVID. The $1.9 trillion bill before Congress this week is unfortunately none of these things, and less than 9% of the money in this bill is tied to public health.  
 

Any further relief should be tied to COVID and aimed at helping our small businesses and reopening our schools. I offered amendments to this bill that would have done just that. Unfortunately, the 286 amendments that republicans offered were rejected.

I have supported several amendments and bills that would help businesses reopen and get students back in the classroom safely. Here are some of the actions I’ve taken to support targeted COVID relief:

	•	Cosponsored the bipartisan. bicameral Restaurant’s Act of 2021, which establishes a $120 billion “Restaurant Revitalization Fund” managed by the U.S. Department of Treasury to help local restaurants – not chains – stay open during the pandemic.
	•	Cosponsored the bipartisan, bicameral FRESH Air for Businesses Act, which provides a payroll tax credit to businesses that purchase or upgrade ventilation and air filtration systems to help prevent the spread of COVID.
	•	Offered an amendment to the funding legislation that would require K-12 schools to reopen as soon as vaccines are made available to teachers. 
	•	Supported an amendment to the funding legislation that would have required K-12 schools to have a reopening place in place for in-person teaching for the remainder of the school year.
	•	Cosponsored the Reopen Schools Act, which would condition the $54 billion Congress allocated to schools in December on them reopening safely for their students.
	•	Supported an amendment that would create a maritime task force and private sector advisory committee to address the safety and future of maritime and cruise line operations post-COVID.

These are the kind of straightforward, bipartisan COVID relief measures I am proud to support.

Sen. Rick Scott: UN Human Rights Council Decision to Host Maduro is Unforgivable 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following the decision by the United Nations Human Rights Council to include Nicolas Maduro as a speaker at its forty-sixth regular session in Geneva.     Senator Rick Scott said, “The UN Human Rights Council has been a joke ever since its decision to allow Maduro, who is committing a genocide against the people of Venezuela, to be a member. Now, they are taking it even further and giving Maduro an open platform to spew his hate and propaganda. I travelled to Cúcuta to visit the Venezuelan border and saw the devastation firsthand. Venezuelan children walking for hours through dense forest, across rivers and over terrorist-controlled territory just to get to a school in Colombia for an education and a meal. Mothers with young children coming to Cúcuta to get the only meal they’d eat for three days. It’s horrific. The UN Human Rights Council should have the words ‘human rights’ stripped from its title, and explain its decision to the millions of Venezuelans suffering under Maduro’s regime.   ""Maduro’s invitation to speak should be rescinded immediately. If not, every freedom-loving nation in attendance should walk out. In the meantime, the U.S. must closely examine our relationship with the UN. American taxpayer dollars should not be used to prop up dangerous dictators, and no more funding should go to the UN until this decision is explained.” Read more HERE.

 Senador Rick Scott: La decisión del Consejo de Derechos Humanos de la ONU de recibir a Maduro como orador es imperdonable 
El Senador Rick Scott hizo la siguiente declaración tras la decisión del Consejo de Derechos Humanos de las Naciones Unidas de incluir a Nicolás Maduro como orador en su cuadragésima sexta sesión ordinaria, que comienza mañana en Ginebra.  El Senador Rick Scott dijo: “El Consejo de Derechos Humanos de la ONU se ha convertido en un farsa desde su decisión de permitir que Maduro, quien está cometiendo genocidio contra el pueblo de Venezuela, sea miembro del Consejo. Ahora, lo están llevando más lejos y le han dado a Maduro una plataforma abierta para propagar su mensaje de odio. Viajé a Cúcuta para visitar la frontera con Venezuela y vi la devastación de primera mano. Niños venezolanos caminando por horas a través de bosques densos, ríos y territorios controlados por terroristas para llegar a una escuela en Colombia y recibir educación y comida. Madres con niños pequeños que vienen a Cúcuta para obtener la única comida que comerían durante tres días. Es muy triste. El Consejo de Derechos Humanos de la ONU debería eliminar las palabras “derechos humanos” de su título y explicar su decisión a los millones de venezolanos que sufren bajo el régimen de Maduro.   ""La invitación de Maduro como orador de esta sesión debe ser revocada de inmediato. Si no, todas las naciones proponentes de la libertad deben abandonar la sesión. Mientras tanto, los Estados Unidos debe examinar de cerca nuestra relación con la ONU. Los dólares de los contribuyentes americanos no deben usarse para apoyar a dictadores peligrosos, y no se deben destinar más fondos a la ONU hasta que den una explicación por esta decision”. Lea más AQUÍ.

 Sen. Rick Scott: The Biden Administration Must Hold the UN Accountable  
Senator Rick Scott released the following statement after the United Nations Human Rights Council’s decision to include Nicolas Maduro, a murderous dictator, as a speaker during its 46th Session this week.  Senator Rick Scott said, “Time and time again I have called out the United Nations’ (UN) hypocrisy for allowing oppressive regimes like Cuba, Venezuela and Communist China to have a seat at a council that is supposed to stand for human rights. The UN has continuously given a platform to dictators like Nicolas Maduro, who jail dissidents, strip citizens of their basic rights and starve their own people. It’s time that the Biden Administration gets serious about our commitment to freedom and democracy and hold the UN accountable.    “President Biden and Linda Thomas-Greenfield, his UN Ambassador nominee, must immediately call on to the UN to rescind Venezuela’s seat at the table and refuse to participate in any session that provides a platform to murderous dictators. They also need to rethink their decision to rejoin the disastrous UN Human Rights Council. All funding to the UN should be suspended until we can reassure American taxpayers that they are not funding an organization that turns a blind eye to the atrocities perpetrated by these regimes. Today, the Senate will vote on whether to proceed with Nominee Thomas-Greenfield’s confirmation. Should the Administration stay silent on this today, I urge my colleagues to strongly consider that cowardice as they vote. It’s time for the United States to unapologetically stand for human rights and hold all who don’t fully accountable."" Read more HERE.

Senador Rick Scott: La Administración Biden debe responsabilizar a la ONU 
El Senador Rick Scott hizo la siguiente declaración luego de la decisión del Consejo de Derechos Humanos de las Naciones Unidas de incluir a Nicolás Maduro, un dictador asesino, como orador durante su 46° sesión esta semana.  El Senador Rick Scott dijo: “Una y otra vez he denunciado la hipocresía de las Naciones Unidas (ONU) por permitir que regímenes opresores como Cuba, Venezuela y la China comunista tengan un asiento en un consejo que se supone que defiende los derechos humanos. La ONU le ha otorgado una plataforma a dictadores como Nicolás Maduro, que encarcela disidentes, despoja a los ciudadanos de sus derechos básicos y mata de hambre a su propia gente. Es hora de que la Administración Biden tome en serio nuestro compromiso con la libertad y la democracia y haga que la ONU rinda cuentas.   ""El Presidente Biden y Linda Thomas-Greenfield, su nominada a embajadora de la ONU, deben pedirle inmediatamente a la ONU que rescinda el asiento de Venezuela en el consejo y se nieguen a participar en cualquier sesión que brinde una plataforma a dictadores asesinos. También necesitan repensar su decisión de unirse nuevamente al desastroso Consejo de Derechos Humanos de la ONU. Todos los fondos para la ONU deben suspenderse hasta que podamos asegurarle a los contribuyentes americanos que no están financiando a una organización que ignora las atrocidades perpetradas por estos regímenes. Hoy, el Senado votará por la confirmación de la nominada Thomas-Greenfield. Si la Administración guarda silencio sobre este tema, insto a mis colegas a que consideren seriamente esta señal de cobardía mientras votan en el día de hoy. Es hora de que los Estados Unidos defienda los derechos humanos y responsabilice aquellos que no lo hagan.” Lea más AQUÍ.

Sens. Rick Scott, Kyrsten Sinema Announce Fly Safe Canine COVID Detection Act 
Senators Rick Scott and Kyrsten Sinema announced the Fly Safe Canine COVID Detection Act, which directs the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to conduct a feasibility study on the use of canine units to screen airport travelers for COVID-19.   Senator Rick Scott said, “As Americans begin traveling more, we have to ensure families are safe. We’ve seen reports that dogs can be effective in detecting COVID-19, and having canine units could provide an important additional level of screening at our airports. I’m proud to join Senator Sinema today to announce legislation directing TSA to conduct a feasibility study on the use of canine units, and will keep working to make sure Americans can travel safely.” Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott: Fed Chairman Jay Powell Must Address Rising Inflation 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement ahead of Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell’s testimony before the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.   Senator Rick Scott said, “For months, I have been warning my colleagues and others about the dangers associated with our rising and unsustainable $27 trillion national debt. America’s debt crisis hurts our citizens in many ways but the most immediate problem it creates is a rise in inflation, which disproportionately hurts America’s low and fixed-income families, like mine growing up.   ""While I have been clear on the need for immediate action and spending reform, my Democrat colleagues as well as Chairman Powell and the Biden Administration continue to blindly disregard this incredibly urgent matter. In fact, President Biden, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, and others are arguing against the data and saying we must plunge our nation deeper into debt with no explanation of the benefit or how we’ll actually pay for it.   “There are strong indications and projections from economists on both sides of the aisle that inflation will rise. When inflation rises, even marginally, the cost of goods goes up. That means families will pay more for essential goods like gas and groceries. American families cannot be put on the hook for the government’s wasteful spending. Today, Chairman Powell must outline his plan to ensure this doesn’t happen and show how he and the Federal Reserve will properly address the threat our national debt poses to our economy, and families and business across the nation."" Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott on USDA Nominee Tom Vilsack: We Can’t Go Back to Obama-Era Cuba Appeasement Policies 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following his vote against the confirmation of Tom Vilsack to lead the U.S. Department of Agriculture.   Senator Rick Scott said, “While I appreciate Tom Vilsack’s commitment to supporting Florida’s growers and agriculture industry, I cannot support any nominee that encouraged Obama-era appeasement and open-trade policies with Cuba. We’ve made significant progress to hold the Cuban regime accountable over the past four years and deny them sources of revenue. Under no circumstances can the United States go back to supporting this murderous regime. We know appeasement policies and open-trade do nothing to help the Cuban people in their fight for freedom and democracy and that any revenue to the Cuban regime goes to enrich corrupt communist oppressors. Cuba is the root of the evil we see in Latin America and we must continue to fight until we see a new day of freedom in our hemisphere.”  Read more HERE.

El Senador Rick Scott sobre el nominado del USDA, Tom Vilsack: No podemos volver a las políticas de apaciguamiento hacia Cuba de la era Obama 
El Senador Rick Scott hizo la siguiente declaración luego de su voto en contra de la confirmación de Tom Vilsack para dirigir el Departamento de Agricultura de EE. UU.   El Senador Rick Scott dijo: “Si bien aprecio el compromiso de Tom Vilsack de apoyar a los productores y la industria agrícola de la Florida, no puedo apoyar a ningún nominado que apoye las políticas de apaciguamiento y comercio abierto de la era de Obama con Cuba. Hemos hecho avances significativos para responsabilizar al régimen cubano durante los últimos cuatro años y negarle fuentes de ingresos al régimen. Los Estados Unidos no pueden, bajo ninguna circunstancia, volver a apoyar a este régimen asesino. Sabemos que las políticas de apaciguamiento y el comercio abierto no ayudan al pueblo cubano en su lucha por la libertad y la democracia y que cualquier ingreso del régimen cubano se destina a enriquecer a los opresores comunistas. Cuba es la raíz de la maldad que vemos en América Latina y debemos seguir luchando hasta que veamos un nuevo día de libertad en nuestro hemisferio."" Lea más AQUÍ.

Sen. Rick Scott Slams Biden Proposal to Raise Taxes 
Senator Rick Scott released the below statement following reports of President Biden’s plan to increase the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. Estimates show that President Biden’s proposal would kill 159,000 jobs, reduce long-run economic output and reduce wages.   Senator Rick Scott said, “President Biden does not care about getting people back to work, spurring economic growth or helping American families and businesses thrive. Biden’s disastrous plan to increase the corporate tax rate by more than 30 percent will have devastating impacts on American families and businesses. His plan will kill 159,000 jobs. That’s 159,000 opportunities stolen from American families. I grew up in a poor family and I watched my parents struggle to find work. I know the value of a job. Biden’s agenda doesn’t make any sense. Now is not the time to attack our job creators.   “With every one of these bad policies, President Biden hands a victory to Communist China and our other adversaries. The Biden Administration needs to end its job-killing war on the American economy and focus on making the U.S. more competitive and attractive to businesses and manufacturers.” Read more HERE.

Sens. Rick Scott and Maria Cantwell Re-Introduce Fly Safe and Healthy Act to Protect Against Spread of COVID-19 
Senators Rick Scott and Maria Cantwell re-introduced the Fly Safe and Healthy Act to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 by launching a pilot program to require temperature checks at TSA screenings for air travelers.   Senator Rick Scott said, “Florida is a huge tourism state, and thousands of families rely on the success of the industry. To get our economy back on track and fully re-opened, Americans need to trust that they can travel safely. The Fly Safe and Healthy Act will enable a temperature check pilot program to ensure passengers with a fever don’t board a plane and put other passengers and airline employees at risk. It also requires airlines to work with a customer to reschedule or cancel their flight if they’re experiencing a fever, and establishes consumer protections to guard against unfair pricing tactics. I’ve been calling for temperature checks for passengers of mass travel since the beginning of the pandemic as a common-sense measure to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and I urge my colleagues to pass this bipartisan bill immediately."" Read more HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott, Sen. Tom Cotton and Colleagues Introduce Bill to End China’s Access to Multi-Year Visas 
Senator Rick Scott joined Senator Tom Cotton and colleagues to introduce the Visa Security Act to end Communist China’s access to 10-year multi-entry visas.  Senator Rick Scott said, “The Obama/Biden appeasement of Communist China did nothing but bolster General Secretary Xi’s power. We know Communist China will stop at nothing to steal American technology and intellectual property in an attempt to dominate the world. There is no reason Communist China should have been given preferential visa treatment, and I’m proud to work with my colleagues to continue to hold them accountable.” Read more from Senator Cotton’s office HERE.

Sen. Rick Scott to Biden Administration: Do Not Approve Release of Funds to Iranian Regime 
Senator Scott released a statement following reports that the Biden Administration is considering approving the release of $1 billion from Iranian bank accounts in South Korea which are currently frozen by U.S. sanctions.    Senator Rick Scott said, “Iran cannot be trusted. The Iranian regime is the world’s largest state-sponsor of terror, and under no circumstance should the U.S. consider easing or undermining sanctions so that Iran can have more funds to build up their nuclear facilities and further destabilize the Middle East. President Biden and Secretary Blinken’s message on behalf of the United States must be crystal clear: Until Iran fully cooperates and its nuclear program is eliminated, there will not be any changes to sanctions or access granted to these funds.” Read more HERE.

Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Leaders Announce Subcommittee Membership 
Senators Gary Peters and Rob Portman, Chairman and Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, announced members that will serve on the committee’s subcommittees in the 117th Congress. Senator Rick Scott will be serving on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) and the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Spending Oversight.    Senator Rick Scott said, “I’m proud to continue serving on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, including on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Spending Oversight. I look forward to continuing our work to protect our nation from foreign and domestic threats and to reform Washington so that every taxpayer dollar spent gets a return on investment for Americans."" Read more from the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee HERE.

Fox News: Rick Scott calls for Biden’s ‘immediate attention’ on moving 2022 Olympics from China 
Senator Rick Scott is requesting to meet with President Joe Biden to discuss the horrific human rights atrocities occurring across Communist China and the Senator’s continued calls for the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to select a new site for the 2022 Winter Olympics Games.   See more from Fox News HERE or in the Fox News article, Rick Scott calls for Biden’s ‘immediate attention’ on moving 2022 Olympics from China, below:   ""Republican Sen. Rick Scott is requesting a meeting with President Biden and calling for his ’immediate attention’ to moving the 2022 Winter Olympic Games out of Beijing, citing China’s human rights abuses.   Scott, R-Fla., said ’the horrific human rights abuses perpetrated by China’s communist government against its own people cannot be ignored.'   'Under no circumstance should the global community give Communist China an international platform to whitewash its crimes, which is what will happen if they are allowed to host the 2022 Olympic Games in Beijing,’ Scott wrote in a letter.   Scott has repeatedly urged the International Olympic Committee to move the games out of China and to a country ‘that respects basic human rights.’   ... Scott pointed that ’more than one million Uyghurs are detained in concentration camps designed to erase their religious and ethnic cultural identities,” and in Hong Kong, “the Chinese Communist Party has worked to strip away the civil liberties of more than five million people.’   ... But Scott said he wanted ‘to make very clear that the United States cannot simply boycott the games.'   … Scott said that working together, he and the president could ‘seize this opportunity to show that America is the world’s greatest supporter of freedom, democracy and human rights for all, while preserving the marvel that is and must always be so perfectly captured by the unity created by the Olympic Games.'   Scott earlier this month also introduced a resolution in the Senate calling on the International Olympic Committee to move the 2022 Winter Olympics out of China and rebid it to another country unless Beijing ‘immediately addresses its egregious and numerous violations of human rights.'""

2,289 doses of COVID-19 vaccine were administered in the Marianas this week, bringing the total to 17,816. That’s 693 shots on Rota, 510 on Tinian, and 16,613 on Saipan. Presently, our Man Amko’ (age 55+), homebound healthcare patients, individuals working in high risk health care and first responder settings, and workers critical to the Marianas infrastructure across the public and private sector are eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine on all islands. Please visit VaccinateCNMI.com to determine when you are eligible and for the most up-to-date information on the COVID-19 vaccination campaign in the Marianas. 
 

More vaccine on the way

The Marianas will receive 9,360 doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in the first week of March. This is a 20 percent increase over February’s allocation and will bring the total doses of the Pfizer vaccine for the Marianas to 30,810. Each individual needs two doses, 21 days apart, for maximum effectiveness. The Marianas will also receive 4,600 doses of the Moderna vaccine, 43 percent more than February’s allocation for a total of 12,800 doses. Two injections are also required for Moderna to be effective. Vaccine distribution data for both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines is publicly available on CDC’s website. 
 
 

American Rescue Plan moves ahead. The Budget Committee released its compiled version of the American Rescue Plan last week and Manager’s amendments to the 591 page bill on Thursday. The House is slated to vote on the relief bill Friday night, as we go to press. Behind the scenes work continues to refine the legislative language (see following story), but we have put together some of the major funding provisions in this chart to keep you informed. The Senate is expected to consider the bill next week, under budget reconciliation rules requiring a simple majority vote for passage. 
 
 

$1,000+ Child Tax Credit increase

One change I negotiated in the Manager’s amendment to the American Rescue Plan is money for the Marianas to pay the increased Child Tax Credit monthly, rather than once a year. The CTC is also going up from $2,000 per child through age 16 to $3,000 per child through age 17. And parents of children six-years-old and under will receive up to $3,600 for each child. In last week’s version of the Rescue Plan payments were to become monthly—everywhere except in the insular areas. I got that fixed in the Manager’s amendment, so parents in the Marianas will also be eligible for advance monthly payments. I also added the $300,000 the Commonwealth told us would be needed to cover the cost of cutting the $250 or $300 checks monthly. The Governor would still have the option to stick with an annual payment, however, if he does not want responsibility for making monthly payments. Child support payments like this have shown to boost academic achievement and improve children’s health and well-being. Long-term studies point to increased lifespans and higher incomes for those helped by these cash transfers. I urge parents to use the money wisely to help their children. 
 
 

Hopwood classroom visit. On Wednesday, I went to Hopwood Middle School to visit Dr. Riya Nathrani’s 7th Grade Computer Literacy Class. Since the pandemic began, I have not been able to make my regular visits to schools nor talk to students face-to-face as much as before. Working for students is my top priority in Congress. So, I hope to get more opportunities to meet these important constituents in the weeks ahead, as our schools reopen. 
 
 

How to recover lost learning hours. Public School System officials described the challenges facing our students, educators, staff and administrative officials during this pandemic, when we met on Tuesday. Though I was able to secure much-needed funding to make sure PSS has the financial resources needed to get through this crisis, there is still much work to do to recover lost learning hours and ensure our students prosper. 
 
 

Congressional Award Info Sessions. I encourage young people between the ages of 13 ½ and 24 to take part in the Congressional Award program. The Congressional Award is the highest award that Congress bestows on young people. It is not a competition, but rather something every individual can earn by meeting goals in personal development, physical fitness, public service, and exploration. Your congressional office will be hosting two virtual info sessions for new and current Marianas participants. You can RSVP for the February 25 session for current participants here. To RSVP for the March 4 session for new participants, please click here. 
 

Furloughed workers now PUA eligible

Marianas workers who had their hours reduced or were furloughed, while their place of employment stayed open, will now be able to collect Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation. The Biden administration issued new guidance yesterday, reversing a Trump administration decision to cut off CNMI government employees and some private sector workers from the federal unemployment aid. I wrote the new President, along with Guam Delegate Michael F.Q. San Nicolas and 11 other Democratic colleagues, the day after Biden’s inauguration, asking for a review of the harmful Trump policy. The “Marianas (kk) expansion,” as the Congressional Research Service is referring to this new interpretation of Section 2102(a)(3)(A)(ii)(I)(kk) of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, allows any individual, who previously filed a PUA/FPUC claim and was denied for any week, to be given the opportunity to self-certify eligibility under the updated eligibility criteria and receive unemployment aid retroactively. 
 
 

18,685 unemployment claims pending

18,685 Pandemic Unemployment Assistance and Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation applications are still waiting to be processed by the Commonwealth as of February 13, according to the U.S. Department of Labor (USDOL). These latest numbers are an increase from the 18,608 applications that were reported pending as of December 12. USDOL tells the congressional office that as many as 18,002 applications, however, may be fraudulent.
 
 

Guerrero previews Chamber plans. Mr. Joe Guerrero, the newly elected President of the Saipan Chamber of Commerce, came by the congressional office Tuesday; and we discussed the Chamber’s plans for the coming year. I look forward to working with Mr. Guerrero in his new capacity and with all the Chamber members to find solutions to the issues faced by our business community. 
 
 

CPA voices minimum wage concern. On Friday, I met with Commonwealth Ports Authority officials regarding proposals in Congress to raise the minimum wage nationwide over 4 years to $15/hour. CPA is not alone in concern about managing the increase from the current $7.25/hour. I successfully added an 18-month hold-off just for the Marianas, when the Education and Labor Committee marked up the American Rescue Plan with the wage hike. And in the past, I have been able to use other legislative means to stretch out wage increases in the Marianas legislatively, avoiding harm to business and job loss, while keeping wages fair to workers. As we go to press, the fate of a minimum wage increase in the Rescue Plan is uncertain. 
 

$2.5m for conservation, recreation

The Commonwealth’s Division of Fish and Wildlife is receiving $2,512,312 in Wildlife and Sport Fish Restoration program grants, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced Thursday. DFW is receiving $1,380,868 in sport fish restoration funds for fishery projects, boating access, and aquatic education, and an additional $1,131,444 in wildlife restoration funds for supporting projects to restore, conserve, manage, and enhance wild birds and mammals and their habitat. The funds are made available from revenues generated by the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration and Dingell-Johnson Sport Fish Restoration acts. When anglers, hunters, and boaters purchase equipment and fuel, the manufacturers and importers of those goods pay into the Wildlife Restoration, Sport Fish Restoration and Boating trust funds. These funds are then distributed to support wildlife agencies across the country. Funding increased substantially this year due to increases in fishing equipment, motorboat fuel, and firearm revenues. 
 
 

President George W. Bush signs the proclamation creating the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument in 2009, as Governor Benigno R. Fitial stands by. The required management plan has just been released for public comment.

Monument plan finally available

The long awaited draft management plan for the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument was released Wednesday—10 years overdue—and now the public comment period begins. President George W. Bush created the Marianas Trench Marine National Monument on January 6, 2009. His Presidential Proclamation 8335 included a two-year deadline for the Interior and Commerce secretaries to prepare the management plan and write regulations to provide for scientific exploration and research, public education and outreach, and sustainable fisheries in the Monument. The draft plan was prepared by the two federal departments in cooperation with the Commonwealth government. The plan defines agency management roles and responsibilities and lays out the goals, objectives, and proposed management activities for the next 15 years. The plan also includes an environmental assessment to evaluate the potential impacts of implementing the proposed management actions. Public comments will be accepted through May 25, 2021. For more information and to submit comments, go to the Federal Register notice. 
 

$139k for vulnerable wildlife

The Commonwealth’s Division of Fish and Wildlife, Department of Lands and Natural Resources, is also receiving $138,770 from the State Wildlife Grant Program, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service announced Friday. The funds will be used to help address a variety of conservation needs identified in the Marianas Wildlife Action Plan including research, fish and wildlife surveys, species restoration, habitat management, and monitoring. The State Wildlife Grants are specifically targeted at accelerating the recovery of threatened and endangered species and preventing other species from having to be listed under the Endangered Species Act. Funds are allocated by formula based on population size and geographic area. Congratulations to DFW. 
 

$428.5k for historic preservation

The Commonwealth’s Historic Preservation Office of the Department of Community and Cultural Affairs is receiving $428,531, the National Park Service announced Wednesday. The grant will be used to support a variety of historic preservation and community projects focused on heritage preservation. The money will also provide technical assistance to private and public interests that seek to preserve and protect historic resources in the Marianas. Appropriated by Congress, Historic Preservation Fund grants are administered by the Park Service and awarded annually to states and territories for the identification and protection of historic properties and supporting activities. Established in 1977, funding for the Historic Preservation Fund is provided by Outer Continental Shelf oil lease revenues. Congratulations to HPO. 
 

Naturalization test info session

The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services is hosting a webinar on the naturalization civics test on Wednesday, March 3, 2021 from 3:30 pm to 4:30 pm ET/ Thursday, 6:30 am to 7:30 am ChST.  Experts will provide an overview of the two versions of the test, the online test preparation materials, and other resources. The test is part of the process to become a naturalized citizen. The two versions are from 2008 and 2020. Both are oral tests. The 2008 civics test will be given to applicants who filed the Form N-400 on or before November 30, 2020.  Applicants who filed on or after December 1, 2020 and before March 1, 2021 will have the option to take the 2008 or 2020 exam.

Meeting with the Korean Cultural Center. Recently I met with members of the Korean Cultural Center. Mr. Kim Hong Kyun, Kim Sung Hun, and Jun Lee presented an Appreciation Plaque for the work we have done together. Keeping in touch with local associations and understanding their needs, challenges, and plans for the future helps me be a better advocate for the Marianas in Congress. Thank you to the Korean Cultural Center for this kind gesture. 
 

$739,500 for Prior Service

The Interior Department announced funding of $739,500 for the Prior Service Trust Fund Program last Friday. The Fund benefits approximately 700 former employees of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. The Federal government assumed responsibility for these retirees, when the Trust Territory ended in 1986. The former TT employees live today in the Marianas, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau.

2/26/21 19:59,"Weekly Wrap-Up: vaccine coordination, bills passed, USPS survey","￼

Dear Lindsey,  This week has been a busy one — beginning at home in the Seventh District and ending with votes at the Capitol. I visited the COVID-19 vaccine clinic at the Richmond Raceway, led an effort calling on the CDC to increase coordination between state and local COVID-19 vaccine distribution strategies, and more.
 
Please keep reading for a quick recap of my work. As always, thank you — it is an honor to serve the Seventh District.
  
 
WHAT I'M WORKING ON
 
  
￼
￼
  
This week included a visit to the Richmond City and Henrico County Public Health Departments' COVID-19 vaccine clinic at the Richmond Raceway. I am proud to see such a robust operation running in our district — our communities are making clear progress in the fight to beat this pandemic.
 
I am so grateful to all the local health officials and volunteers who are using their skills to save lives and keep our neighbors safe.
  
 
￼
 
  
Also this week, I led an effort calling on the CDC to improve its COVID-19 vaccine coordination with Virginia's public health officials. The varied eligibility requirements and appointment making procedures between Virginia vaccine allocation and several federal programs favor the well-resourced and technologically-savvy. If changes are not made, those who are patiently waiting their turn according to Virginia Department of Health guidelines could be overlooked. READ MORE FROM THE RICHMOND TIMES-DISPATCH
 
Friday afternoon, the House passed my legislation to strengthen protections for two areas of the George Washington National Forest — the Rough Mountain and Rich Hole Wilderness Areas. These lands offer outstanding scenic views, rare and endangered plants, ages-old hardwood forests, and a dense population of black bears, and this bill keeps them open to recreation while protecting their wildlife, natural resources, and trails for Virginians to enjoy for generations to come.
  
￼
  
On Thursday, the House Agriculture Committee held its first hearing of the new Congress, focusing on how farmers and producers can lead on the issue of climate change. Farmers are already some of our country's most prolific conservationists. I've heard from crop and livestock producers in the Seventh District about how farming and conservation practices they employ are benefiting the environment and building more sustainable operations. As the Chair of the Conservation and Forestry Subcommittee, I am urging my fellow lawmakers to recognize the valuable perspective of farmers on conservation and climate change issues and bring them to the table as we work to tackle the climate crisis. READ MORE FROM THE CULPEPER STAR-EXPONENT
  
 
U.S. POSTAL SERVICE SURVEY
 
  
Thank you to everyone who has shared with me their experiences and concerns regarding USPS delivery delays. Since opening the survey on Tuesday, my office has received more than 3,200 stories from Central Virginians about how they or someone they know are being impacted. If you have not yet taken my survey and would like to share your thoughts, please complete it HERE.

IN OUR DISTRICT
 
  
Our constituent services team is here to advocate on your behalf. If you are having an issue with a fedral agency or program like Medicare, Social Security, or the VA, my team is here to serve you.
 
Since taking office in January 2019, my team has closed 1,830 constituent cases and returned $4,571,789 in backlogged benefits to Seventh District residents.
 
If I or my staff can be of service to you, please call us at (804) 401-4110 or complete this form on my website.
  
Need Help with a Federal Agency?
  
On Thursday, I proudly voted to pass the Equality Act to protect the rights of our LGBTQ+ community members, friends, family, and fellow Americans. Every person is deserving of equal protection under the law, and no person should ever face discrimination because of who they are.
  
￼
  
As the pandemic continues to impact our Central Virginia communities, I will continue push for the relief and coordinated vaccine distribution strategy our families, businesses, and communities need to make it through this pandemic and successfully recover. I know this focus is top of mind for so many in the Seventh District — and it is my priority as well.
  
Sincerely,
Abigail

Dear friend,
This week brought encouraging news on the COVID-19 vaccine front as more vaccine dose shipments arrived in our region. As a result, people who work in emergency services, child care and education, and food and agriculture, including grocery store employees, will be eligible to receive a vaccine starting tomorrow. Click here to learn how different agencies will vaccinate these new eligible groups. You can also check your eligibility and be notified when it's your turn to be vaccinated here.
As we make progress in the fight against this virus in San Diego and across the country, I urge you to stay safe by wearing masks, frequently washing your hands, and practicing social distancing. We're not out of the woods yet.
This week, I continued my work in Washington, D.C. Below is another update on some of the work my staff and I have done this week to serve you.

Legislative Work
Reintroduction of the Workforce Mobility Act
This week, I reintroduced the bipartisan, bicameral Workforce Mobility Act with Rep. Mike Gallagher (WI-08), Rep. Anna G. Eshoo (CA-18), and Rep. Peter Meijer (MI-03). This bill seeks to help American workers by limiting employers’ ability to force employees to sign non-compete agreements.
While California has long prohibited the use of non-competes, one in every five workers nationwide is covered by a non-compete agreement. Forty percent of American employees have been constrained by a non-compete agreement at some point during their career. The Workforce Mobility Act would narrow the allowable use of non-compete agreements to only include extraordinary cases such as the sale of a business or the hiring of senior executives. It would also require employers to explicitly inform their employees of the limitations non-compete agreements impose. Click here for more information on this bill.
American Rescue Plan Act
Today, the House expects to pass President Biden's American Rescue Plan Act. This COVID-19 relief bill would provide $1,400 stimulus checks per person, $56.75 billion for vaccines and testing, $130 billion for K-12 schools, and extend unemployment benefits, among other critical provisions. This proposal is a good start, but I hope further improvements can be made in the Senate to ensure this funding targets individuals, families and businesses who need it the most. This would include extending the duration of unemployment payments with automatic triggers, adjusting the amount and timing of state aid based on real revenue shortfall, and expanding funding for the industries that are hurting the most, specifically restaurants, attractions, and live entertainment. I'm hopeful that these changes will further arm the fight against COVID and provide funding where and when it’s truly needed.  

District Work
Meeting with leaders of the Dawoodi Bohras community
 
Last Friday, I met with leaders of the Dawoodi Bohras community of San Diego, a branch of Islam from the Indian subcontinent. We spoke about the community's traditions, customs and beliefs, as well as how members are helping others throughout this pandemic with food drives and other helpful events.

Peace Corps Information Night
 
Join us next Monday for a special information night on the 60th anniversary of the Peace Corps. I'll be speaking with local past volunteers and recruiters about their experiences during their service, how people can join the Peace Corps and how the organization has adapted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The event will take place from 5:00 to 6:00 P.M. via Zoom and will be streaming live on Facebook.

NEW: Participate in our weekly poll!
We've recently introduced a new section in our e-newsletter for readers to weigh in on a relevant topic. Thank you to everyone who has participated so far. Here's this week's question:

What do you think should be the next legislative priority for Congress after it passes the American Rescue Plan?

Click here to submit your answer via Google Forms. We'll share the results in next week's e-newsletter.
Last week's question was: ""Optimizing [the national] grid may reduce carbon emissions, improve system resiliency and reduce wholesale power costs, but would require the federal government to override state and local objections to power line permitting and construction. Would you support this kind of overhaul to our power grid? Here are the results:
370 Responses: 67.3% Yes, the grid's capabilities need to be modernized for current demand and to promote renewables. 22.4% Other 10.3% No, this would be an unnecessary undertaking.

If you have any questions, comments, concerns, or need assistance with a federal agency, reach out to us through our website or by calling the district office at 858-455-5550.

￼ 

For Immediate Release
Contact: Lisa Reynolds
202-225-2831 
 Rep. Weber (TX-14) Statement on the American Rescue Plan of 2021
Washington, D.C. – Friday, February 26, 2021, U.S. Rep. Randy Weber (TX-14) issued the following statement on H.R. 1319 – American Rescue Plan of 2021.   ""Once again exploiting the pandemic, Democrats' forced through a $1.9 trillion bailout under the guise of COVID-19 relief.  This enormous bailout follows the $4 trillion already spent on direct aid to American households, unemployment insurance,  stimulus checks, rental assistance, testing and hospital visits, small business loans, PPP funds, law enforcement assistance, firefighter grants, healthcare, health providers, pharmaceutical companies, vaccine rollout, and education. All that, and we still have $1 trillion from the previous aid packages that have gone unspent!
""This legislation is not designed to help Americans recover from the pandemic. It is designed to implement a four-year-long wish list of partisan policies. Only 9% of the current bill’s spending is focused on COVID relief.  The other 91% is designated to partisan political priorities.
""Some of these priorities include:
	•	Controversial Silicon Valley Underground Tunnel
	•	$350 billion in blue state bailouts
	•	$86 billion in union pension bailouts
	•	$34 billion to expand Obamacare
	•	$200 million for the Institute of Museum and Library Services
	•	$135 million to the National Endowment of the Arts
	•	$1,400/week for 15 weeks to federal bureaucrats to stay home and not work if their kid's school is remote.
""Not only are these policies partisan and wasteful, but they also discourage the reopening of schools, disincentivize employees from returning to work, reward federal employees at the expense of everyday Americans, incentivize further lockdowns and stifle honest attempts to successfully reopen the economy.
""At its best, this bill would be an attempt to throw money at a problem -- a problem you can’t solve with money.  At worst, it is a shameless attempt to deceive our citizens -- masquerading bailouts of failed liberal policies as pandemic relief for Americans.
""For these reasons, how could anyone in good conscience vote for this bill?  I vote NO.""

2/26/21 20:54,The Blackburn Report: Calling Out Wasteful Spending,"￼
THE BLACKBURN REPORT  February 26, 2021 
SENATE INSIDER  
CALLING OUT WASTEFUL SPENDING 
While some politicians are trying to sweep wasteful spending under the rug, I’m calling out the left’s exorbitant wishlist. Americans deserve real COVID relief—not more funding for “climate justice” and Planned Parenthood. As the budget reconciliation process moves over to the Senate, I remain resolved to work against wasteful spending and provide an aid package that benefits the American people. 
￼ 
￼ 
HOLDING CHINA ACCOUNTABLE
Until the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) ends its systematic violations of human rights and religious freedom, the United States cannot remain complicit by offering 10-year multi-entry visas to Chinese nationals. I joined my colleagues in the Senate to introduce the Visa Security Act which will halt the revolving door the CCP has exploited for half a decade and instead demand accountability in the global human rights effort. 
  
Also, to address China’s increasingly threatening maritime presence, I signed a letter to Secretary of Defense Austin asking the Navy to detail what steps they will take to bolster U.S. ship manufacturing to counter CCP competition in global waters. In addition to preserving U.S. military superiority, a robust shipbuilding industry provides job security for Tennesseans in manufacturing, nuclear engineering, and more.
  
PUSHING BACK ON JOB-KILLING AGREEMENTS 
By rejoining the Paris Climate Accords, the Biden administration prioritized leftist goals (and the desires of foreign countries!) above the needs of the American people. I introduced legislation to prohibit U.S. taxpayer dollars from being used to rejoin the job-killing Paris Climate Agreement along with a Senate resolution calling on President Biden to submit the Paris Agreement to the Senate for review as required under the Constitution. The Paris Agreement puts hard-working Americans out of work during an unprecedented pandemic, and the decision to rejoin cannot come at the expense of the American taxpayers or without the consent of the Senate.
￼ 
￼ 
PROTECTING CHILDREN ONLINE 
Children are increasingly living their lives behind screens, and the jarring reality is that this leaves more innocent kids at risk of exploitation. I introduced the End Child Exploitation Act to give law enforcement the tools they need to investigate these crimes and collect the evidence needed to hunt down online predators. Read more about the legislation and the importance of protecting children online here. 
  
SUPPORTING TELEHEALTH 
Many of our rural Tennessee communities aren’t just underserved—they are unserved. Expanding the availability and use of telehealth services is an essential step toward bringing our nation’s healthcare into the 21st century. The Telehealth Modernization Act, which I cosponsored, will work to expand Medicare coverage for telehealth services and support communities in need of health care resources.
  
MARSHA’S ROUNDUP 
Our Tennessee parents, teachers, and students have adapted well to partial virtual learning and have made an impressive effort to reopen schools. Unfortunately, parts of the United States are lagging in getting kids back into the classroom. On the Senate floor, I denounced funding that rewards school closures and demanded a return to safe, responsible, in-person learning. 
￼ 
￼ 
We should expect our Cabinet secretaries to be experienced and willing to represent the values of the people they serve. The President’s nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Xavier Becerra, is neither. He lacks any relevant work experience in health care and promotes policies, such as abortion on demand, that are far removed from what the American people support. That’s why I joined with my colleagues to request President Biden formally withdraw Becerra’s nomination. 
￼ 
￼ 
During Attorney General Nominee Merrick Garland’s confirmation hearing, I pressed him on two critical issues facing our country—big tech and China. Our chief legal officer must take these threats seriously. 
￼ 
￼ 
Without strong borders, every town is a border town, and every state is a border state. The new immigration proposal from the Biden administration underscores leftist efforts to turn the United States into a sanctuary country. The American people deserve to feel safe, and I am working to ensure that our borders stay secure.
￼ 
￼ 
A $15 minimum wage would destroy small businesses and job opportunities in our workforce. While some politicians are trying to fit their agenda into the already massive spending bill, I explained the importance of supporting aid that is timely, targeted, and temporary.

Dear Friend,

I hope you’ve had a great week! Before the weekend, I want to make sure you saw a few quick updates on my work for you in Congress. Take a look:

Virtual Town Hall on COVID-19 Vaccines
 

Last night, I hosted a virtual COVID-19 town hall with local health care experts Dr. Sajen Mathews and Dr. Imran Sharief. We talked about the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines and the importance of following public health guidelines to stay healthy and safe.

I want to thank everyone for taking the time to tune in and ask questions. If you could not watch the town hall, I posted the full video on my social media pages. You can watch it HERE.

Protecting Small Businesses
 

Small businesses are struggling to make ends meet and keep their doors open during COVID-19. More than 19,000 small businesses in California alone have closed in the past year. To unilaterally raise all entry-level wages to $15 will severely affect the ability of hardworking entrepreneurs to stay afloat. At a time when most businesses have a razor-thin profit margin, raising the minimum wage would be devastating for millions of businesses and the jobs they represent.

Instead of increasing the costs for small businesses, we should be looking to decrease costs and restore some of the economic certainty that was lost due to COVID. You can watch my testimony and questioning HERE.

Encouraging the Next Generation of STEM Experts
 

Thursday, February 25th, was Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day. As your Representative, I want to encourage young women and girls to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. I am proud to fight for opportunities for our students. Today’s students are tomorrow’s problem solvers who will unlock space, science and so much more. Watch my video celebrating this special day HERE.

Honoring our California National Guard
 

I caught up with the men and women of our California National Guard to hear more about their work over the last few weeks. I was also honored to help recognize SPC Charles Boyer, SPC Jeremie Montez, PFC Angelica Serna & SPC Sean McKee of the 223rd Military Intelligence Battalion for going above and beyond their call to serve.
I am grateful for their service and sacrifice.

Protecting our Environment and Promoting Conservation
 

I am committed to creating commonsense solutions to protecting our environment. We can reduce emissions and address climate change while also ensuring access to affordable energy and creating jobs.

I discussed conservative solutions to protect our environment with the American Conservation Coalition, Young Asian Pacific American Leaders and fellow California Representative Michelle Steel (CA-48). Check it out, HERE.

Investing in STEM Opportunities for our Students
 

The jobs of the future require our students to be proficient in STEM fields. Lockdowns and long-term remote learning have hurt our students’ scores in math and science, and may have impacted our nation’s future talent pool. Students in kindergarten through high school are the future of our STEM talent pipeline. We must grow our STEM workforce and provide resources necessary for every child to succeed.

You can watch my testimony during a meeting of the House Space, Science and Technology Committee HERE.

Strengthening America's Foreign Policy in Asia
 

As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, I am focused on ensuring America has a robust foreign policy that puts the needs of the U.S. and our allies first.

One of the most consequential issues we face is our approach to dealing with North Korea and our partnership with South Korea. We must work towards the complete and irreversible denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula to enhance the U.S.’s safety and the world’s safety.

The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of working with international partners to fight global pandemics. Until 2017, Taiwan was a member of the World Health Organization (WHO) until it was forced out by China. I asked witnesses how the Biden Administration will work to include Taiwan in the WHO and create a truly global partnership to prevent future pandemics.

2/26/21 21:09,We will pass the American Rescue Plan!,"
 

Dear friends and neighbors, 

The American Rescue Plan is set to pass the House of Representatives very soon! Once it is passed, we will be one step closer to securing much-needed relief for Central Floridians in need. 

The plan will help us defeat COVID-19, support businesses and essential workers, reopen schools safely, deliver relief to working families and increase our vaccination efforts. It includes funding for testing, tracing, personal protective equipment and other necessary investments to ensure that students can safely return to the classroom. The American Rescue Plan also ensures immediate relief for households struggling economically by providing economic impact payments, direct housing assistance, an expanded Child Tax Credit, extended unemployment benefits and more. Additionally, the plan supports businesses affected by systemic discrimination with EIDL grants and expanded PPP eligibility among other things. 

The following State and Local Fiscal Relief Funds will go to Central Florida’s Counties: 

	•	Osceola County: $73 million 
	•	Orange County: $270 million 
	•	Polk County: $141 million 

While we are proud to see our efforts to provide aid succeed, this moment also leads us to reflect on everything we have encountered as a nation since the onset of this pandemic. We've been faced with uncertainties, unforeseeable situations and moments that have required us to step up and show up for one another. 

This week, we surpassed 500,000 American lives lost to this virus. Each loss serves as a reminder of the severity of this pandemic and the importance of doing our part to protect ourselves and those around us. 

We've worn masks and socially distanced, and currently have the opportunity to save lives by getting vaccinated once we're eligible. The existence of multiple safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 is a testament to the resilience our nation exhibits when faced with difficult moments. 

In the District

Celebrating 25 years of 
﻿Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI)
 

On Monday, we discussed Latino student success, COVID-19 relief and the U.S. Citizenship Act with students from Valencia College, the University of Central Florida, Florida International University, and more. I admire the opportunity to learn more about the perspective of our next generation of leaders! 
 

Meeting with advocates from the ONE Campaign
 

Constituents from the ONE Campaign updated me on the global movement to end extreme poverty and preventable disease by 2030 with justice and equality. 
 

Discussing global child immunization programs
 

I had an informative meeting with constituents from the Shot@Life campaign regarding the value of U.S. investments in global child immunization programs and their contribution to the global COVID-19 response. 

In Washington, D.C. 

Securing non-discrimination protections
 

House Democrats proudly passed H.R. 5, the Equality Act to secure non-discrimination protections for LGBTQ Americans in housing, employment, education, public accommodations, and more. It is our responsibility to ensure that all Americans are protected from discrimination. 
 

Addressing COVID-19 vaccine concerns
 

During an Energy and Commerce Committee hearing, I asked Soledad O'Brien about the importance of conversations grounded on facts and led by science. We must address the mistrust and false information surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine with truth about its safety and efficacy. 
 

Protecting public lands for a healthier future
 

I voted in favor of a package of bills that protect 1.5 million acres of wilderness, 1,000 miles of river and the Grand Canyon from mining. By passing this package, we are able to secure a better, cleaner and healthier future for all Americans.

Fighting for Hometown Values
 
Dear Friends,
I kicked off a busy three-week session of Congress working hard and focusing on representing the hometown values of Colorado’s Third Congressional District. I opposed overreaching legislation threatening the safety of women and girls, wasting our tax dollars bailing out blue states, and seizing 550,000 acres of land in our District.
 
Legislative Leadership
Protecting Women and Young Girls
I adamantly oppose the Equality Act’s efforts to take away the safety and security of women and young girls. This bill allows biological males to share locker rooms with biological females. Additionally, it creates an unsafe and uneven playing field for female athletes who risk getting injured competing against biological males. The Equality Act also takes away safe spaces for women by mandating that domestic violence shelters, intensive counseling facilities, and prisons house biological males and females together.
In addition to its attack on women, the Equality Act also threatens the family. Provisions in the bill allow government bureaucrats to seize children if their parents refuse to allow them to undergo life-altering transgender surgery that could lead to sterilization, hormone imbalances, and major medical complications. This radical legislation also requires healthcare workers to perform taxpayer-funded abortions and sex change surgeries—even if it goes against their deeply held religious and moral beliefs. I will always support the Constitutional rights of Americans, so I was proud to speak against this radical bill on the House Floor.
 
 
 
￼
 
Protecting Your Tax Dollars
I opposed the “COVID relief package” which is really just a partisan $1.9 trillion spending spree. $1.9 trillion should be able to give each American $5,700 in stimulus money, but the bill only delivers $1,400 per person. Furthermore, less than 9% of the money goes to public health efforts. So where does it all go?  $510 billion goes to a blue state bailout, $12 billion goes to foreign aid, and $135 million goes to the National Endowment for the Arts. This bill also allows money to flow to Planned Parenthood and other pet organizations that support liberal causes. Given the amount of cherry-picking in this opportunistic legislation, I cannot support it as a legitimate policy to fight COVID. I released a video explaining why I cannot in good conscience vote for this partisan bill.
While some politicians claim that we need to pass this bill urgently in order to get through the pandemic, we still have $1 trillion left in unspent federal money that was passed in previous COVID relief packages. We have already spent billions to open schools that remain closed. There are no provisions in this bill that provide a clear plan to getting the country back to normal—it just serves to give D.C. politicians the opportunity to spend more money.
￼
 
Protecting our Land
After a year of burdensome lockdowns and overreaching intrusions into our daily lives, the last thing Americans need are more government regulations. But this is exactly what House Democrats have in mind. One of their first orders of business for the 117th Congress was to pass H.R. 803, the “Protecting America’s Wilderness and Public Lands Act,” locking up 1.5 million acres of new wilderness, halting recreational use of existing land, stifling responsible energy development, and killing even more jobs in our fragile economy that is already suffering from the pandemic.
Most importantly, this bill is a disaster for national security. Even though the United States could be energy independent, leftists would rather import oil from hostile countries than drill here with responsible environmental practices. There is no reason for America to be dependent on our enemies. Even more concerning than the loss of oil and natural gas resources, this ill-advised bill would dramatically reduce the amount of uranium able to be mined in the United States. Half of our uranium supply already comes from hostile countries, and this number will only go up if we pass this bill, leaving our electrical grid and naval fleet vulnerable.
The Democrat sponsors of this bill did not take time to consult with the local communities affected by it. If they had, perhaps they would have heard about the problems posed by the loss of water rights, job killing regulations, and recreational restrictions. Most importantly, perhaps they would have heard that 2020 was a record-breaking fire season, and that the unscientific prohibitions on fire management in this bill will cause more burnt-down homes, ruined livelihoods, and lost lives. It is easy for Denver and D.C. politicians to regulate how other people can protect themselves from wildfires, but how would they feel if their homes, families, businesses, and livestock were at risk of going up in flames? I say we torch this bill instead of letting our communities burn.
The Mesa County Commissioners, Montezuma County Commissioners, Dolores County Commissioners, Archuleta County Commissioners, White River and Douglas Creek Conservation Districts, the Colorado Farm Bureau and numerous other constituencies in Colorado strongly opposed H.R. 803 because of the damage they know it will cause and activities it will prevent.
The Grand Junction Chamber sent me a letter opposing this bill stating, “These are lands that are literally in our backyard in Mesa County yet Congresswoman DeGette continues to ignore us, does not meet with us, and does not even consider the consequences of her bill on the hardworking families of our areas.”
I am proud to have voted against H.R. 803 and led the opposition in a House Floor speech and testimony opposing this landgrab.
I also authored and sponsored 11 amendments to protect the Third District from this job-killing bill that seeks to keep the American people from utilizing their public lands. Additionally, I worked with my colleagues to lead 9 other amendments that I cosponsored to fight this massive landgrab.
Read more about my efforts and the support from local communities HERE.
￼
Putting Taxpayers First
I wrote a letter to IRS Commissioner Charles P. Rettig calling for him to look into reports of law-abiding citizens in my District who filed their taxes on time but then received letters threatening federal liens, seizure of property, and garnishment of wages. My hardworking constituents spent hours on the phone with the IRS, experienced tremendous stress and fear, and were threatened due to no fault of their own, but rather, because the IRS has a huge problem with the backlogged tax return processing system.
I will continue to fight for accountability in the tax system, and I will make sure that law-abiding citizens have a defender to help them navigate issues with federal agencies. If there is anything my office can help you with, please don’t hesitate to ask for help.
 
Boebert Blast
I wrote an article for Fox News voicing my adamant opposition to earmarks. Americans are tired of the D.C. way, and now is not the time for more wasteful spending.
￼
I passionately opposed the Left’s efforts to threaten the safety and security of women and young girls with the passage of the Equality Act.

IA-01 Update From Congresswoman Hinson

Friend, 

After spending the last few weeks traveling through Iowa, and visiting all 20 counties in the First District, the House was back in session this week and I was in Washington, D.C. 

Iowa’s families, businesses, and communities are still struggling after nearly a year of dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown. While traveling through the district, I heard directly from Iowans about the need to expand and extend critical lifelines like the Paycheck Protection Program that allowed small businesses across Iowa to keep their doors open, as well as direct assistance that helped families make ends meet during this difficult time.

I would have been the first to cross the aisle and compromise to help deliver this relief to Iowans and put our country back on the right track. However, the bill did not focus on COVID-19 relief, stopping the spread of the virus, or getting students and teachers back in the classroom. In fact, less than 9% of the money in the legislation would go toward public health measures to combat the spread of COVID-19. Instead, the House version of the bill prioritized harmful and divisive provisions like a federally mandated $15-dollar minimum wage. Even though there is $1,000,000,000,000 from previous relief bills still unspent, this legislation contained no guardrails to ensure new money is used for pandemic relief this year. This is a flagrant abuse of taxpayer dollars. 

As a Member of the House Budget Committee, I had the opportunity to try and make this bill better and direct resources to actual COVID-19 relief and mitigation efforts. I teamed up with my fellow Iowan, Representative Randy Feenstra, to offer a motion that would have stopped certain aspects of this bill from being implemented until a full and detailed report on how these policies would impact workers is made available to taxpayers. I also called on my colleagues to ensure frontline workers can get vaccines and offered a motion that would prevent schools that fail to reopen from receiving additional federal relief funding. 

These attempts were ultimately rejected by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, and despite our best efforts, the final bill they plan to bring to the House Floor tonight is unacceptable--it is a Democrat spending bill, not a COVID-19 relief bill. 

In addition to my efforts to provide targeted COVID-19 relief to Iowans, I was also hard at work on priorities for Iowa's First Congressional District, including fighting for our farmers! Read on for more about my work for you this week.

Best,

Iowa Agriculture Update 

In Washington, I am focused on policies that will boost Iowa's agriculture industry and support our farmers. We have to ensure that we are continuing to expand beneficial trade relationships, push back on bad actors like China, and ensure our farmers are not forgotten after this trying year.

Iowa Delegation United for Custom Cattle Feeders

The entire Iowa Delegation banded together this week to urge US Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to include custom cattle feeders in the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program. Currently, custom cattle feeders are being excluded from this assistance program even though their businesses and lives have been disrupted. We hope that Secretary Vilsack will fix this oversight and ensure Iowa’s custom cattle feeders are included in relief programs going forward.

2/27/21 2:58,I Voted for the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021,"￼ 


Dear Friend,
In the traumatic year since the COVID-19 pandemic attacked our country and the world, countless families have experienced heart-shattering personal losses. Parents, children, friends, neighbors, and colleagues have lost their lives fighting the virus. Businesses have shuttered, schools have closed, and our way of life with family and friends has nearly disappeared. 
President Biden’s American Rescue Plan is a courageous and positive step to address the destructive tragedy of the coronavirus pandemic. I applaud my Democratic colleagues who crafted this bold and unprecedented response in support of the American people. I was proud to vote for the American Rescue Plan on behalf of my constituents and the nation as a whole.
This bill will provide individuals and families, including those of mixed status, with an economic impact payment of $1,400 to help pay for essentials such as food, utilities, rent, medicine, and other life-saving essentials. It will ensure unemployed workers can continue to receive unemployment benefits during our emergency economic shut down. And it will ensure the continuation of critical food assistance for those in need.
The legislation will also provide much-needed assistance to homeowners struggling to make their mortgage payments and provide resources to help families pay their back-rent to prevent eviction and homelessness. And finally, the American Rescue Plan will recognize the dignity of work by raising the national minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2025. This wage increase is critical to ensuring all working families are earning a living wage to meet their most basic needs.
Beyond vital pocketbook issues, the legislation also reinforces the primary responsibility of our federal government to respond effectively to the pandemic by activating the Defense Production Act to ensure a more prolific means by which to guarantee the supply of the materials we need to manufacture the vaccine and the hardware needed to inject it into the arms of individuals to prevent further spread of the virus. To address the weaknesses in our public health infrastructure’s ability to respond to the crisis, the legislation also provides funding to support critical community health centers, which are vital to the health care needs of my constituents and Americans nationwide.
This pandemic is unlike anything our world has encountered in over one hundred years. This robust package is a testament to the strength of our nation and its responsibility and ability to meet the challenge of any crisis. I heartily commend President Biden and my colleagues in the House and Senate who have worked so hard on behalf of the American people to address the catastrophic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has taken the precious lives of over 500,000 Americans.

2/27/21 6:01,VACCINE SURVEY ENCLOSED: Stepping up our nation-wide vaccination plan,"￼

 
Got Vaccinated? Share Your Experience!
 
 
February 27, 2021  
Dear Friends,
This week our nation mourned the unfathomable loss of more than 500,000 Americans to COVID-19 over the course of the pandemic. President Joe Biden ordered flags lowered to half-staff for five days to mark this devastating milestone. To those of you who have lost someone, know that my staff and I—and countless others across our Capital Region and throughout our nation—grieve with you. 
The end of this pandemic cannot come soon enough. One of the most important steps we can take to reach that goal is to achieve widespread COVID vaccination. I have worked for months to drive up production and distribution of this lifesaving resource and am gratified that we are now approaching 50 million Americans vaccinated. In fact, we marked several key milestones this week in the effort to improve vaccine rollout and put us on the path to achieve herd immunity. 
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is expected to grant emergency use authorization for Johnson & Johnson’s safe and effective single-dose vaccine today, following its endorsement Friday by a panel of FDA experts. This vaccine not only provides significant protection against COVID generally, testing shows it to be as effective as other vaccines at reducing hospitalizations and deaths. We are told an estimated four million doses could be ready and available as soon as next week.
As I write this, House Democrats are working to advance President Biden’s American Rescue Plan. This comprehensive, compassionate legislation makes critical investments to expand vaccine distribution, support businesses and workers, get children back safely to school and deliver direct relief to struggling families. Despite arcane Senate rules, I am working to ensure it also includes a gradual increase to a $15 minimum wage. 
We still have a long road ahead to defeat this pandemic, rebuild or economy and rescue our working families and communities. But these efforts bring us ever closer to achieving these goals. And each of us has an important part to play in the coming months.
As we continue to improve and expand vaccine rollout in our Capital Region and nation, I’d like to hear from you! Have you been able to get a COVID-19 vaccine? What has your experience been like? What are your priorities and plans as we continue the national vaccination process? Let me know by clicking on the survey image below.

Rep. Loudermilk Brings Transparency to Democrats' COVID ""Relief"" Bill
 

 
 
Press Release: Fed Chairman Expects Economy to Grow Despite Calls for a $1.9 Trillion ‘COVID’ Stimulus Package
 
 
Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-GA) issued the following statement after questioning the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell, in today’s House Financial Services Committee hearing entitled Monetary Policy and the State of the Economy.

“Today, Chairman Powell publicly told me that the Fed expects the economy to grow ‘strongly’ this year. The growth could be as high as 6 percent, depending on how we respond to COVID [i.e., vaccines, treatments, etc.]. However, Speaker Pelosi is ramrodding through Congress the second largest spending bill in history, with almost $2 trillion of hardworking American taxpayer’s money.

Press Release: Only Hearing Reveals H.R. 1 is Unworkable for Election Administrators, Violates Free Speech, and Publicly Funds Congressional Campaigns
 
 
Committee on House Administration Republicans, Reps. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.), Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.), and Bryan Steil (R-Wisc.), reveal H.R. 1 is unworkable for election administrators, violates free speech, and publicly funds congressional campaigns during the only committee hearing on H.R. 1 before the bill heads to the floor next week.

“H.R.1 is an 800 page bill that strips the Constitutional authority for managing elections away from the states, and imposes unbelievable centralized federal control over our nation’s elections; but the Democrats don’t want the American people to know what’s in it,"" said Loudermilk. ""This massive bill was, by formality, assigned to eleven different House committees; but, Democrats have only mustered one two-hour hearing - in the House’s smallest committee - and without allowing for changes or amendments, nor even having a vote on it. Quite frankly, they do not want much attention on this bill, because if the experts and the American people knew what was in it, they would be outraged. If this was such a great piece of legislation, as they claim, they would not be afraid to have public input, deliberation, or at least a committee vote on it. Unfortunately, Nancy Pelosi has shown that she has no interest in following regular order, or abiding by House Rules regarding how legislation is passed. Once again, the American people are going to have a piece of legislation rammed through without anyone fully comprehending its impact.“

In the News: Democrats Dealt Blow on Minimum-Wage Drive for Covid-19 Bill
 
 
Wall Street Journal: 

""The Senate parliamentarian told lawmakers Thursday night that a proposed increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour didn’t comply with Senate rules, dealing a blow to Democrats’ efforts to include it in the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.

The parliamentarian, the neutral arbiter of the chamber’s rules, issued guidance saying she thought it didn’t meet the guidelines for reconciliation, the process that Democrats are using to pass their relief plan with a simple majority in the Senate, and would be ruled out of order.""

2/27/21 6:37,Recovery Updates for the Fourth Congressional District,"
 
 

Dear Lindsey,
 
Last week was a trying time for many Texans. We’ve heard the sometimes-deadly stories of families losing heat and power for extended periods. We’ve heard reports of hospitals worried about a lack of water and the potential this shortage had to overwhelm them more than even the Coronavirus.

But we’ve also heard amazing tales of Texans banding together to take care of our own. In the light of this disaster, many of us were brought together as we haven’t been in quite some time. This storm will likely go down in history as the most expensive disaster in Texas history, and as we all rebuild together, I’m hopeful we’ll continue to unite around our shared love of Texas.

I want to email you today to briefly check-in and let you know about the work we’ve done for the citizens of Texas’ Fourth District and provide some resources you may find helpful.

I also want to let you know that Governor Abbott requested that the President include every one of Texas' 254 counties in the Major Disaster Declaration. The President only certified 108 counties. I believe this is a failure in leadership for the most expensive storm in Texas history. I've signed a letter urging President Biden to finish the job as soon as possible, but you can help too. Complete a report with the Texas Department of Emergency Management (TDEM) and give them the critical data needed to secure additional support from Washington. You can also call (844) 844-3089 between 8 am and 8 pm. 

As always, we’re here to help with anything from connecting you with state agencies providing relief on the ground to assisting with your federal disaster relief application. If there’s anything we can do, please call my district office at (972) 771-0100 and we’ll get right on it.

For Texas and Liberty,
 

Pat Fallon, Congressman
House of Representatives

Staying Connected to Our Local Officials

As the disaster was unfolding, we’ve maintained close contact with our state and local officials to track the storm’s progress, damage across the district, and resources available. From working with the Texas Department of Emergency Management (TDEM) and attending their daily briefings, to coordinating with Governor Abbott and our county officials, we’ve made sure to communicate CD4’s needs as they happen.

I've personally been in contact with all 18 county judges, having spoken to most and invited everyone, to discuss the latest developments, get updates from the Texas Department of Emergency Management (TDEM), and answer any questions they’ve been having as we get through this struggle together.


FEMA Disaster Declaration

As of today, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has declared a major disaster in 108 of Texas’ 254 counties. Just this morning, I joined 26 of my colleagues in calling on President Biden and his administration to expand the declaration to every county in our state. Not only would this declaration make much-needed aid available to our citizens to help rebuild, but it would also send a strong message showing the administration’s commitment to ensuring Texans recover. 
 

 

TIART Damage Survey

As the Texas Department of Emergency Management (TDEM) works to assess damage across the state and submit supplemental information to support a more widespread disaster declaration, TDEM is asking all residents to submit damage surveys through the Texas Individual Assistance Reporting Tool (TIART). 

Results from the survey will identify damages across the state to assist emergency management officials to understand needs and plan recovery efforts from the recent winter weather. TDEM Is asking citizens to submit one survey per address.

Results from this survey are critical to getting additional counties included in the disaster declaration as it serves as the basis for damage assessment justifications to FEMA in support of our request for additional assistance.


Disaster Resource Webpage

My staff has assembled a list of resources for the district to help track the federal government’s response efforts, detail available resources from the agencies of Texas, provide information from your local county offices, and more. Is there information you need that you’d like to see added? Just drop my team a message and we’ll get right on it.

WEEK IN REVIEW 
Dear Friend –    In every corner and county of our state, and communities across the nation, the coronavirus pandemic has impacted everyone.    Among the folks hit hardest by the economic fallout of this virus have been women and working moms. At the same time, our youngest generation is falling behind with the continuation of virtual learning—which is failing to give them the education they need. 
￼ 
WATCH: In January alone, 275,000 women left the workforce.  
For some helpful guidance, I suggest we follow these revised and updated three R’s of education: Respect the science; Reopen our schools safely; Return students, teachers, and learning to the classroom. 
￼ 
Click here or on the image above to watch my remarks.   
The experts, the health officials, and the data have made it clear: we can, and we should, safely reopen our schools. Iowa has led the way on this, and it’s time for other states to follow our lead.   The well-being of our children, our working moms and dads, and our nation’s economy depend on it.  

$15 Washington-mandated minimum wage is not the right answer for Iowa 
A Washington-mandated federal minimum wage hike to $15/hour during a global pandemic would put a major burden on Iowa’s small businesses at a time when they can least afford it—killing 1.4 million jobs and increasing child care costs on average by 21% per year for families.   Don’t just take it from me—listen to what Iowa small business owners have to say about it: 
￼ 
WATCH: Iowa small business owners describe the detrimental effects of the one-size-fits-all, Washington-mandated $15/hour minimum wage. 

Standing Up for Iowa Farmers 
Many of Iowa’s farmers and producers have been unable to conduct business as usual due to the COVID-19 pandemic. I joined my fellow Iowans in urging newly-confirmed U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to expand eligibility of the department’s COVID-19 relief programs to include custom cattle feeders—a sector of Iowa’s agricultural economy operated primarily by family farmers.
￼  Click here or on the image above to read our letter. 

Decency and Human Life 
In January 2016, Iowan Sarah Root was killed by a drunk driver who was in our country illegally, was released, and never faced justice. Ever since, Sarah’s family has felt the enormous and unimaginable pain of the loss of their daughter.
￼ 
Click here or on the image above to read more about my effort from KWWL. 
No family should ever have to go through what Sarah’s mother, Michelle, and others have gone through. That’s why I’m leading the Senate in denouncing the Biden Administration’s plan to ease immigration enforcement priorities for those charged with drunk driving and violent crimes—a move that could allow more violent criminals like Iowan Sarah Root’s killer to escape justice. 

BONUS READ 
Access to quality, affordable child care is hard to come by—particularly in Iowa’s rural areas—and our kiddos and working parents are paying the price. As a mom who has been in those situations, I’m going to keep pushing at the federal level to help tackle this crisis.

2/27/21 9:00,Randy’s Roundup: An update on the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion spending bill,"
 
 
 

Dear Friend,

This week the House was back in session to consider the Democrats’ $1.9 trillion spending bill, which they disingenuously refer to as “COVID relief.” Below are important updates on what is actually in that bill and additional information on my effort to provide disaster relief for farmers affected by last year’s derecho.
 

MY PUSH FOR TARGETED RELIEF
﻿
On Monday, the House Budget Committee held a markup session on the $1.9 trillion “COVID relief” bill. After looking further into everything that’s in the bill, it became clear that Democrats are using it as a trojan horse to advance their political agenda rather than taking a temporary, targeted approach that will benefit all Americans.

Only nine percent of the $1.9 trillion in taxpayer money being spent in this bill is related to public health and combating the virus. The rest is chock-full of progressive agenda items that have nothing to do with the pandemic. For example, nearly $500 billion in taxpayer money -- Iowans’ money -- will be spent to bail out blue states whose own policies have shuttered businesses, further damaging their economies after decades of reckless spending. Millions more will go towards Democrat pet projects, like a bridge to Canada and a train in Silicon Valley. This is on top of the Democrats’ attempt to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, which will destroy at least 1.4 million jobs and force rural main street businesses like hardware stores, grocery stores, and bakeries to close their doors. 

I made a motion to ensure that this relief package is a targeted response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Read more by clicking here or on the graphic below:﻿ 
 
 

MEANWHILE, DEMOCRATS STRIP RELIEF FOR IOWA FARMERS IMPACTED BY THE DERECHO

I’m extremely disappointed that Democrats in the House have voted to turn their backs on Iowa farmers by voting to ax derecho disaster relief. We’re about to enter planting season, and many farmers are still recovering from losses due to the pandemic and last year's devastating derecho. Farmers across the country who suffered from natural disasters in 2020, in the middle of this pandemic, need relief now. 

As the only bipartisan amendment to pass out of any committee, it was the last hope for bipartisanship in the entire reconciliation process. But it’s clear Democrats have never been interested in ""unity."" They're only interested in advancing their agenda -- an agenda that benefits coastal states and leaves Iowans behind.

I will continue working with my colleagues in the Senate to push back against Speaker Pelosi’s attempt to strip relief for Iowa farmers, and I will never stop fighting to deliver results for the hardworking men and women in Iowa who feed and fuel the world.

WATCH: Democrats take away relief for victims of natural disasters like the derecho, instead choosing to fund Pelosi's Payoff to Progressives:

ADDING CUSTOM CATTLE FEEDERS TO CFAP

I joined the Iowa delegation in urging the USDA to include custom cattle feeders in the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP). CFAP has played a critical role in supporting farmers who suffered market disruptions from the pandemic. Our custom cattle feeders must be included as well.

2/27/21 9:04,Rebuilding America,"￼ 

February 27, 2021 
Dear Fellow Marylander: 
The good news: positivity rates for COVID-19, at least in Maryland, are dropping, along with hospitalizations and deaths. Vaccination rates are up and, despite the ongoing frustration people are experiencing getting an appointment, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that more than 1.81 million doses of vaccine have been delivered to Maryland. 
Also good news: The American Rescue Plan has passed the House of Representatives and will be considered in the Senate next week. The new, major package will bring needed relief directly to Americans, to our states, as well as cities and towns of all sizes. Assistance includes additional rounds of direct payments, funding to help struggling renters and homeowners, more funding for local school systems to safely reopen, crucial support for the hardest-hit small businesses to keep their doors open and navigate COVID-relief programs, expansion of mental health services, and funding to increase the speed of vaccine distribution and COVID-19 testing. With nearly 20 million men and women still out of work, it is no wonder that as many as 7 in 10 people support this relief package. 
These two pieces of good news are directly related. We have an economic crisis in America that will not end until our public health crisis ends. 
The pandemic is not over, but now that we have a functioning federal strategy in place to tackle COVID-19, we are in a stronger position to outline how and where we can make the investments in our economy so that it provides the strong foundation to build America back better than before. 
Robust federal investment in infrastructure across a range of categories, from railroads and bridges to water, schools, and broadband creates jobs, expands opportunity, and lays a foundation for future economic growth. We need to improve our roads but also think far beyond them. This has been a priority for me, as well as the Transportation Alternatives Program – bikes, pedestrians and other non-car options – that improves transportation infrastructure for local communities in ways that fit their specific needs. 
I have been working on a wide range of infrastructure programs and projects since I arrived in the Senate. This Congress will be a bit different as I take over as chair of the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee, which is part of the Committee on Environment and Public Works. This means I will have a direct role in developing the programs that will help rebuild and strengthen the backbone of American communities. 
In this new role, I was proud to join a bipartisan group of senators in the Oval Office a few weeks ago to meet with President Joe Biden on this very topic. His charge to us was to work together. Stay bipartisan in our efforts and go big. We are digging this country out of a historic hole in responding to the devastating impacts of COVID-19 over the past year. Families and communities in Maryland and across the country have been on the edge and they need a lifeline. In responding to the immediate challenge of recovery, we also are looking to make investments in infrastructure that will shape our future for decades to come. This is not a time for timidity. 
The Senate Environment and Public Works Committee has a strong track record of bipartisanship and we all tend to agree that we are long overdue for a major federal commitment to our infrastructure. I agree with President Biden that we must come together this year to act boldly on transportation and infrastructure—not only to reauthorize our critical programs, but to break new ground with smarter investments. 
As we rebuild America from the ground up, we need to recognize that the way we’ve done things in the past may not be suited to our new realities—the need to address our climate crisis and the need to expand opportunity and address racial inequity and social disparities. 
The winter storm that wreaked havoc in Texas and other states reminds us of how infrastructure and climate change are intertwined. We need to acknowledge the reality of climate change and build our infrastructure to be more resilient to its impacts and more protective of our environment. 
For communities of color, infrastructure policy has for too long meant only the destructive and harmful impact of development, rather than the benefits and opportunities that infrastructure projects should bring. 
The challenges of climate change, equity, and safety can be positive drivers of economic opportunity that can help us improve the strength and competitiveness of our economy and improve the health and wellbeing of our communities. While these challenges require bold investment, the cost of inaction is far greater. 
This week, John Porcari, a former Maryland Secretary of Transportation, called this is a “generational opportunity” to invest in our infrastructure and pay it forward to future generations. You can see more of my Facebook/YouTube conversation with John and Eulois Cleckley, Executive Director, Denver Department of Transportation and Infrastructure at this link. The key outcome of this conversation is that investing in a broad range of infrastructure will make America more competitive, safer, smarter and more equitable for our communities, our environment, and our future. 
We need to be bold. We need to get this right. 
Thank you and stay safe.

2/27/21 9:05,Democrats Trojan Horse COVID Package,"￼
Dear    

Good Saturday morning. 

This past month has been filled with a lot of noise coming out of Washington. We had the impeachment trial of President Trump that amounted to nothing more than a political distraction, and we had a COVID-19 ""Relief"" bill introduced in Congress that is chock full of liberal wish list items. With all of this going on, I wanted to give you an update on several of the most important things from this past month that I want to be sure you don't miss. 
￼ 
COVID-19 Vaccines
Last week, I had the opportunity to visit the COVID-19 vaccine clinic at the Marshall County Health Department. They are administering the Moderna vaccine to hundreds of people every day. The day I was there they gave more than 600 people their second dose. It was great to see that Congressionally approved funds for vaccine research has now resulted in real vaccinations in our district. It is my hope that by the middle of 2021, everyone who wants to receive the COVID-19 vaccine will have been able to do so.
COVID-19 ""Relief"" Bill 
President Biden and Democrat leadership created a massive $1.9 trillion spending bill, calling it ""COVID-19 Relief"". To be clear, this spending bill is a far cry from being actual financial relief related to COVID. When you break down the figures, it is roughly $1 trillion that goes toward liberal wish list items rather than areas that could actually use help.
Here are just a few of the crazier items put into this spending bill under the pretense that it is ""COVID-19 Relief"":
	•	$220 billion designated specifically for states with high unemployment numbers. Meaning that states like New York and California that have shut down their economies get a massive bailout, while Republican led states where businesses were allowed to open will get close to nothing. (California had some of the most strict Covid lockdown measures, yet still had extremly large positive rates.)
	•	$185 billion to bail out mismanaged pension plans with no reform required.
	•	$129 billion toward elementary and secondary schools, and $40 billion to higher education. At a time when help is needed to reopen our schools now, it is unacceptable that 95% of this ""relief"" will be spent between 2022 and 2028 - well after the pandemic is over.
	•	$50 billion for FEMA.
	•	$39 billion will go towards childcare.
	•	$30 billion for public transit.
	•	$1.5 billion for Amtrak.
	•	$1 billion in world food assistance.
	•	$1.5 million for the ""Seaway International Bridge"", which happens to be a priority for Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer.
While these are just a few examples of the billions that have nothing to do with COVID-19 relief, there are many other provisions that fall along this same line. 

Rural Broadband
As many of you probably know, rural broadband is one of my top legislative priorities in Congress. For years I have been fighting to ensure that rural America gets the same quality of broadband that the rest of America has, and it's a fight I will not stop until we finally get rural broadband done.
Two weeks ago, I sent out an online survey to the 4th Congressional District to gather additional data about your access to broadband. Thanks to the 1,600+ responses, there is now data on this issue for our community. For those of you who were able to participate, thank you! The valuable responses you sent in will go a long way in my continuing fight, and I plan to use these figures in the halls of Congress to push rural broadband to the forefront of legislative action. Here are a few of the highlights:
￼ 
￼ 



I hope you have a good weekend, even though it's going to be a rainy one.

2/27/21 9:30,America’s Jobless,"
 

Congressman Smith's E-news: February 27, 2021  
 
 

This week I met with Ponca High School students to hear their concerns about the pandemic, education, and share a bit about what it is like to serve in Congress. I also met with Ambassador Koji Tomita, the new Ambassador of Japan to the United States. I look forward to working with Ambassador Tomita and the US-Japan Caucus to strengthen the US-Japan Alliance and deepen the trade and cultural ties between our countries. 

America's Jobless

Defeating COVID-19 includes reconnecting unemployed Americans. Before the pandemic, America’s economy was thriving. Workers at the bottom of the income ladder were seeing the largest wage gains in recent history. Two principle achievements from the last 25 years - the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and the 1996 Welfare Reform Act - ensured Americans benefitted from hard work. 
 
At the start of 2021 the unemployment rate nationally was 6.3%, with 10.1 million Americans unemployed. Nebraska is one of only 18 states with an unemployment rate of less than 5%. These are disturbing numbers, especially when I hear from employers across the Third District who have jobs to fill. It is equally disturbing that large portions of the spending in the Biden Administration’s proposed “relief” package conflict with our efforts to get the unemployed back to work. Increasing the existing weekly unemployment insurance add-on from $300 to $400 and extending it through the summer creates incentives not to work. 
 
Last year, Congress enacted numerous bipartisan relief packages to support Americans enduring the unforeseen circumstances brought on by COVID. The legislation provided incentives like the Payroll Protection Program and Employee Retention Tax Credit which were specifically designed to keep Americans on payrolls. Likewise, I supported a strong expansion of the Child Tax Credit and doubled the standard exemption as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act to ensure workers in our state could keep more of every dollar they earned, enhancing the benefit of work. 
 
Democrats’ proposal to disconnect the Child Tax Credit from work by distributing it in the form of monthly benefit checks would undermine these bipartisan efforts. Under their proposed plan, those without jobs would still receive their monthly Child Tax Credit payment on top of benefits like UI and TANF, furthering the incentive not to work. At a time when employers in Nebraska are looking for workers, this “tax credit” would become the first completely unconnected welfare benefit in two generations. 
 
I encourage President Biden and Congressional Democrats to hit the brakes on the current proposal and have a serious discussion about how we can best help struggling Americans and bring our nation together. I remain committed to ensuring a brighter future for Nebraskans and their families.   

Spending Package
I spoke on the House floor to strongly oppose Speaker Pelosi’s $1.9 trillion spending package, most of which is not focused on COVID relief.

Ways and Means 
This week, the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health held a hearing titled The Path Forward on COVID-19 Immunizations. I had the opportunity to question the witnesses regarding the best plan of action for vaccine distribution and getting children back in the classroom.

Notable Votes
This week Congress voted on the Protecting America's Wilderness and Public Lands Act. The Department of Interior and National Park Service already have trouble maintaining the lands and properties they oversee, and this bill would create another 1.5 million acres of wilderness under federal control, much of it against the wishes of local communities. I opposed this bill.

 Dear West Virginian,  This week, we hit the ground running in Washington and continued our work for the people of West Virginia.  I spoke on the Senate floor about the need to reopen our nation’s schools, joined Fox Business Network to urge my colleagues to deliver a bipartisan, targeted COVID relief bill, and led an Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW) hearing focused on rebuilding our nation’s infrastructure.  I also introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at supporting working West Virginia families, delivering resources to fight the drug crisis, and promoting America’s national security interests around the world.  Returning Students, Teachers, and Learning to the Classroom  On Wednesday, I joined several of my GOP Senate colleagues in addressing the need to safely reopen schools in West Virginia and the nation.  My message was simple: Get our children back to school. Respect the science, reopen the schools safely, and return students, teachers, and learning to the classroom – where it should be.

Rebuilding our Nation’s Infrastructure   This week, the Senate EPW Committee held our first infrastructure hearing of the 117th Congress focused on rebuilding America’s infrastructure.  As Ranking Member, one of my top priorities is to pass a surface transportation reauthorization bill that revitalizes our nation’s infrastructure and gets people back to work. I’m confident we can come together and once again use a bipartisan process to develop the bill that includes priorities from both parties.  In West Virginia, this would mean needed, additional highway capacity and the completion of vital projects like Corridor H.

Additional Discussion on COVID Relief   On Thursday, I joined Neil Cavuto on Fox Business Network’s Coast to Coast to discuss the $1.9 trillion partisan spending package Democrats are attempting to pass, and the need to deliver targeted COVID relief for West Virginians.  Their bloated proposal is mostly a Democrat funding wish list, like bailing out poorly run states and green energy projects that have nothing to do with combating COVID-19.

In Case You Missed It  I continue to work with my senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle to introduce meaningful legislation that supports working families back home. In case you missed it, here are some bills that I helped introduce this week: 
	•	Family Support Services for Addiction Act   
	•	Composite Standards Act   
	•	21st Century Space Grant Modernization Act

Rep. Adriano Espaillat Votes to Pass the Biden American Rescue Plan to Deliver Urgent Relief to the American People

MSNBC  Live: Weekends - https://fb.watch/3W5IZDQ7FX/


WASHINGTON, DC – Today, Rep. Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) voted to pass H.R. 1319, the American Rescue Plan Act, landmark, life-saving legislation that will provide urgently-needed resources to defeat the virus, get vaccines in people’s arms, put money into families’ pockets, return children safely to the classroom, and put people back to work. 

“New York families’ lives and livelihoods have been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic and economic crisis,” said Rep. Espaillat. “These hard-working Americans cannot afford further delay, which is why I proudly joined my colleagues today to pass President Biden’s bold, strategic relief package that delivers the long-overdue resources needed to meet the needs of my constituents and families across the country. With tens of millions of Americans infected, more than half a million lives lost, millions more unemployed and food and housing insecure, the time for action is now, and we will not be deterred from this critical mission.” 

The Biden American Rescue Plan will save lives and livelihoods:
• Put Vaccines in Arms: The plan will mount a national vaccination program that includes setting up community vaccination sites nationwide. It will also take complementary measures to combat the virus, including scaling up testing and tracing, addressing shortages of personal protective equipment and other critical supplies, investing in high-quality treatments and addressing health care disparities.

• Put Children Safely Back in School: The plan will make a nearly $130 billion investment in school re-opening and making up for lost time in the classroom. These funds can be used for such things as reducing class sizes, modifying spaces so that students and teachers can socially distance, improving ventilation, implementing more mitigation measures, providing personal protective equipment, and providing summer school or other support for students that help make up lost learning time this year. The plan also provides resources for higher education, Head Start and child care facilities.

• Put Money in People’s Pockets: The plan finishes the job on the President’s promise to provide $2,000 in direct assistance to households across America with checks of $1,400 per person, following the $600 down payment enacted in December. The plan will also provide direct housing assistance, nutrition assistance for 40 million Americans, expand access to safe and reliable child care and affordable health care, extend and expand Unemployment Insurance so that 19 million American workers can pay their bills and supporting 27 million children with an expanded Child Tax Credit and 15 million low-wage workers through the Earned Income Tax Credit. It will give 27 million workers a raise and lift one million out of poverty by raising the federal minimum wage.

• Put People Back In Jobs: The plan will provide crucial support for the hardest-hit small businesses, especially those owned by entrepreneurs from racial and ethnic backgrounds that have experienced systemic discrimination, with EIDL grants, expanded PPP eligibility and more. The plan also provides crucial resources to protect the jobs of first responders, frontline public health workers, teachers, transit workers and other essential workers that all Americans depend on.

The American Rescue Plan is strongly supported by a large majority of the American people – including 60 percent of Republicans – bipartisan state and local leaders, national education groups, trade unions and advocacy organizations, and hundreds of businesses and chambers of commerce. Economists agree that the American Rescue Plan’s targeted, evidence-based action is needed – both for struggling families and for the American economy. The legislation’s provisions will generate $1.25 for every $1 of spending, will cut child poverty in half and will lift nearly 12 million people out of poverty. As Mark Zandi, Chief Economist of Moody’s Analytics, has said, “It’s better to err on the side of too much rather than too little. Interest rates are at zero, inflation is low, unemployment is high. You don’t need a textbook to know this is when you push on the fiscal accelerator.”

If the American Rescue Plan is not enacted now, the results could be catastrophic, with 4 million fewer jobs this year, according to Moody’s, and it could take a year longer to return to full employment. An entire cohort of young people may have lower lifetime earnings because they were deprived of another semester of school. Millions of parents, particularly mothers, could be forced to stay at home, reducing their wages and job prospects because they have no choice but to care for their kids. And without this package, it will take another four years of suffering before real GDP returns to its pre-pandemic levels, according to the nonpartisan CBO.

“With House passage of the Biden American Rescue Plan, New Yorkers can rest assured that Help Is On The Way,” continued Rep. Espaillat. “As the bill goes to the Senate for further actions, I will continue to work to ensure that this essential legislation gets to the President’s desk to be signed before unemployment benefits expire in March. With the cost of inaction growing and families struggling in every community in every state, I call on Republicans to end their partisan obstruction and join us as we not only meet the needs of our constituents but Build Back Better.”

Rep. Adriano Espaillat vota por la aprobación del Plan de Rescate Estadounidense de Biden para brindar ayuda urgente al pueblo estadounidense

MSNBC  Live: Weekends - https://fb.watch/3W5IZDQ7FX/


WASHINGTON, DC – Hoy, el congresista Adriano Espaillat (NY-13) votó para aprobar la H.R. 1319, la Ley del Plan de Rescate Estadounidense, una legislación histórica que salva vidas y que proporcionará los recursos que se necesitan con urgencia para vencer al virus, vacunar a las personas, poner dinero en los bolsillos de las familias, retornar a los niños a las aulas de forma segura, y poner a la gente a trabajar.

""La vida y los medios de subsistencia de las familias de Nueva York han sido devastados por la pandemia del coronavirus y la crisis económica"", dijo el Rep. Espaillat. “Estos estadounidenses laboriosos no pueden permitirse más demoras, por lo que hoy me uní con orgullo a mis colegas para aprobar el paquete de ayuda estratégico y audaz del presidente Biden que brinda los recursos necesarios para satisfacer las necesidades de mis constituyentes y familias en todo el país. Con decenas de millones de estadounidenses infectados, más de medio millón de vidas perdidas, millones más de desempleados y con inseguridad alimentaria y de vivienda, ahora es el momento de actuar, y nadie nos disuadirá de esta misión crítica”.

El Plan de Rescate Estadounidense de Biden salvará vidas y medios de subsistencia:
• Vacuna a las personas: El plan montará un programa nacional de vacunación que incluye la creación de sitios comunitarios de vacunación en todo el país. También tomará medidas complementarias para combatir el virus, incluida la ampliación de pruebas y rastreo, aborda la escasez de equipo de protección personal y otros suministros críticos, invierte en tratamientos de alta calidad y aborda las disparidades en la atención médica.

• Retorna a los niños a la escuela de forma segura: El plan hará una inversión de casi $130 mil millones en la reapertura de escuelas y la recuperación del tiempo perdido en el aula. Estos fondos se pueden usar para cosas como reducir el tamaño de las clases, modificar los espacios para que los estudiantes y maestros puedan distanciarse socialmente, mejorar la ventilación, implementar más medidas de mitigación, proporcionar equipo de protección personal y brindar clases de verano u otro apoyo para los estudiantes que ayuden a compensar el tiempo de aprendizaje perdido este año. El plan también proporciona recursos para la educación superior, Head Start y centros de cuidado infantil.

• Pone dinero en los bolsillos de la gente: El plan completa su propósito con la promesa del presidente de proporcionar $2,000 en asistencia directa a hogares en todo Estados Unidos con cheques de $1,400 por persona, luego del pago inicial de $600 promulgado en diciembre. El plan también proporcionará asistencia directa para la vivienda, asistencia nutricional para 40 millones de estadounidenses, ampliará el acceso a cuidado infantil seguro y confiable y atención médica asequible, extenderá y expandirá el Seguro de Desempleo para que 19 millones de trabajadores estadounidenses puedan pagar sus facturas y ayuda a 27 millones de niños con un Crédito Tributario Adicional por Hijos y a 15 millones de trabajadores con salarios bajos a través del Crédito Tributario por Ingreso del Trabajo. Dará un aumento a 27 millones de trabajadores y sacará a un millón de la pobreza al aumentar el salario mínimo federal.

• Pone a la gente a trabajar nuevamente: el plan brindará apoyo crucial para las pequeñas empresas más afectadas, especialmente aquellas que son propiedad de empresarios con antecedentes raciales y étnicos que han experimentado discriminación sistémica, con subvenciones EIDL, elegibilidad ampliada del PPP y más. El plan también proporciona recursos cruciales para proteger los empleos de los socorristas, los trabajadores de salud pública de primera línea, los maestros, los empleados de transporte y otros trabajadores esenciales de los que dependen todos los estadounidenses.

El Plan de Rescate Estadounidense cuenta con el firme apoyo de una gran mayoría del pueblo estadounidense –incluido el 60 por ciento de los republicanos–, líderes estatales y locales bipartidistas, grupos educativos nacionales, sindicatos y organizaciones de defensoría, y cientos de empresas y cámaras de comercio. Los economistas están de acuerdo en que el plan de acción y basado en evidencia del Plan de Rescate Estadounidense es necesario, tanto para las familias en dificultades como para la economía estadounidense. Las disposiciones de la legislación generarán 1.25 dólares por cada 1 dólar de gasto, reducirán la pobreza infantil a la mitad y sacarán de la pobreza a casi 12 millones de personas. Como ha dicho Mark Zandi, economista en jefe de Moody's Analytics: “Es mejor pecar de demasiado que de muy poco. Las tasas de interés están en cero, la inflación es baja, el desempleo es alto. No necesitas un libro de texto para saber que es cuando presionas el acelerador fiscal"".

Si el Plan de Rescate Estadounidense no se promulga ahora, los resultados podrían ser catastróficos, con 4 millones de empleos menos este año, según Moody's, y podría tomar un año más regresar al pleno empleo. Una cohorte completa de jóvenes puede tener ingresos menores a lo largo de su vida porque se les privó de otro semestre de escuela. Millones de padres, especialmente madres, podrían verse obligados a quedarse en casa, reduciendo sus salarios y perspectivas laborales porque no tienen otra elección que cuidar de sus hijos. Y sin este paquete, pasarán otros cuatro años de sufrimiento antes de que el PIB real vuelva a sus niveles anteriores a la pandemia, según la CBO, un órgano no partidista.

“Con la aprobación por parte de la Cámara de Representantes del Plan de Rescate Estadounidense de Biden, los neoyorquinos pueden estar seguros de que la ayuda está en camino”, agregó el Rep. Espaillat. “Mientras el proyecto de ley llegue al Senado para nuevas acciones, continuaré trabajando para asegurar que esta legislación esencial llegue al escritorio del presidente para ser firmada antes de que expiren los beneficios por desempleo en marzo. Con el costo de la inacción en aumento y familias que pasan dificultades en cada comunidad de cada estado, pido a los republicanos que pongan fin a su obstrucción partidista y se unan a nosotros, ya que no solo satisfacemos las necesidades de nuestros constituyentes, sino que también Reconstruimos Mejor que Antes"".

Honoring the Life of Congressman-Elect Luke Letlow
 
This week, I joined my colleagues in the Louisiana Delegation during a Special Order on the House Floor in honor of the late Congressman-Elect Luke Letlow. Luke lived an extraordinary life and I was honored to call him a friend. He had a servant’s heart and unwavering dedication to his family, faith, and service to others. Click here or on the image below to view my remarks honoring Luke Letlow.

Follow the Science: Reopen Schools for In-Person Learning Now
 
Louisiana parents and teachers have worked hard to get many students back in the classroom. Unfortunately, thousands of students and parents across the country are still struggling as teachers' unions refuse to reopen schools and Washington Democrats pursue legislation that fails to provide accountability or immediate relief to safely reopen schools for in-person learning.
 
While over $1 trillion remains unspent from previous COVID relief bills, Washington Democrats have rushed to pursue their partisan, wasteful spending package that has no focus on getting children back in school as soon as possible. Less than 10% of this nearly $2 trillion package goes to combatting COVID-19 through public health. Additionally, 95% of the money for schools won’t be spent until after 2021 – slowing down getting kids back in school.
 
The Biden Administration must stop following the teachers’ unions and start following the science. The CDC has made it clear that schools can safely reopen for in-person learning. Dr. Fauci has said the benefits outweigh the risks. Students simply can’t be forced to wait any longer to get back in classrooms. Their mental health and futures depend on it. 
 
Extremism Should be Condemned on Both Sides of the Political Aisle
 
This week, I participated in an Energy and Commerce Subcommittee hearing regarding the spread of disinformation and extremism. Instead of addressing these serious issues, Washington Democrats focused on government censorship and silencing of political views. 
 
I emphasized the danger of disinformation and extremism in the media by highlighting my personal experience from the baseball shooting where the shooter was motivated by prominent politicians and media personalities. Now more than ever, it’s imperative that leaders and media figures from both parties must unequivocally condemn political violence of all kinds.

Weekly Update | February 27, 2021
 

COVID Relief Hijacked by Partisan Politics

Today the Democrats’ partisan COVID relief bill passed the House. This action followed their repeated rejection of efforts to advance bipartisan solutions that are targeted, temporary, and tied to COVID relief.
﻿
Read More About My Vote on This Bill Here

President Biden campaigned on bipartisanship and pledged to lead the country in a unifying way. It is clear he does not intend to keep that promise. I believe both parties have an obligation to our constituents to work together and find common ground. This bill should've been negotiated in a bipartisan manner, but hundreds of Republican amendments were shut down at every turn. Federal aid needs to be targeted to those in need and spent immediately. That’s not what this bill does. Vast sums aren’t pandemic related and won’t be spent for years. I support strengthening our vaccine program, helping our kids get back in school and providing relief to those families and businesses who need it most.

Clearly, this legislation has more to do with politics than providing relief to the American people. We have already appropriated $4 trillion and $1 trillion of that has yet to be spent. Those remaining funds are ready to be used for vaccine distribution, school reopenings and helping those in need. This nearly $2 trillion package is aimed more at pleasing the far left progressive wing of the Democratic party than it is targeted towards defeating the virus. And while Congress should be working to lower unemployment the CBO says policies in this bill would put an additional 1.4 million Americans out of work. It's unfortunate that politics, for the first time, has gotten in the way of helping people recover from this pandemic.

Hearing on H.R. 1: The Largest Expansion of the Federal Government's Role in Our Elections

As the Ranking Member of the Committee on House Administration which oversees federal elections I delivered the opening statement below at a hearing on H.R. 1 (the Democrats' elections bill) this week. My remarks focused on the federal election mandates, public funding of campaigns and attacks on the First Amendment within H.R. 1.

The hearing revealed the legislation is unworkable for election administrators, violates free speech and publicly funds congressional campaigns. The bill is scheduled to be on the floor next week without going through a markup where amendments could be offered.

More Important Updates

Visiting with Students in Nokomis and Celebrating National FFA Week
 

Last week I enjoyed visiting with students at Nokomis North Elementary and answering their questions. Principal Reedy and I discussed the Coronavirus precautions they are taking to safely hold class in-person. Recently I met with K-12 administrators from across my district and was glad to hear that most all are holding some in-person instruction and a large amount are fully in-person 5 days a week. Our kids deserve the best learning environment we can give them which is undoubtedly the classroom. 

Also related to students, I was proud to cosponsor a resolution in Congress this week designating February 20th through the 27th as National FFA Week. The thousands of high school students who celebrated across Illinois this week are the future of agriculture. As a member of the House Ag Committee I wish them all the success in the world as they prepare themselves to feed and fuel us for years to come. 
 

Announcing the ""All-American Road"" Designation for the Great River Road
 

The #GreatRiverRoad in Illinois now has the distinction of being an ""All-American Road"" after being designated as such by the U.S. Department of Transportation. This designation will bring more regional and national attention to the byway which should increase tourism activity that supports many communities I serve. I look forward to driving along the river soon knowing I'm on a roadway recognized for its historic and cultural importance.

Commemorating Montgomery County's Bicentennial
 

Click here or the image above to watch my remarks. 

I recently commemorated the bicentennial of the founding of Montgomery County, Illinois on the House floor. The county was formed February 12th, 1821 and named in honor of Revolutionary War General Richard Montgomery who gave his life for American independence.

Montgomery County has a rich history including being a friend to Illinois’ favorite son, President Abraham Lincoln. He made frequent visits when he represented the community in the Illinois legislature. 

Congratulations to the citizens of Montgomery County on their home’s bicentennial. They are the ones who make the county a great place to live and I am proud to represent them in Congress.

Launching the Congressional Colorectal Cancer Caucus
 

My colleague Congressman Donald M. Payne, Jr. and I launched the Congressional Colorectal Cancer Caucus this week to raise awareness and advocate for legislation to combat this horrible disease. 

Fighting colorectal cancer and reducing its incidence is personal to me. At the age of 26 my wife was diagnosed with a genetic form of cancer, Lynch syndrome, that could affect our kids, and we’re fortunate that she was able to receive treatment that saved her life. Colorectal cancer is the 2nd leading cause of cancer death among men and women combined in the U.S., and those deaths are preventable.

Davis, Payne Launch Congressional Colorectal Cancer Caucus
 

Introducing the CONTRACT Act
 

On Thursday I joined my colleague Congresswoman Julia Brownley to introduce the CONTRACT Act of 2021 to help FAA Contract Towers hire and retain air traffic controllers. In IL-13 this would help the Decatur Airport, Central Illinois Regional Airport in Bloomington and St. Louis Regional Airport in Bethalto maintain safe airways. Ensuring contract towers are adequately staffed is critical to their ability to maintain safety and continue operations. Additionally, these airports are often integral parts of the local economy and any reduction in controller capacity could have a negative economic impact. 

Davis, Brownley Introduce CONTRACT Act to Support Air Traffic Controllers
 


Introducing the PREPARED Act
 

On Friday Congresswoman Dina Titus and I introduced the PREPARED Act to protect animals during disasters. The bill would require entities regulated under the Animal Welfare Act – such as zoos, commercial animal dealers, and research facilities – to have contingency plans in place to safely evacuate and care for animals in an emergency or disaster situation. 

When natural disasters strike animals are put in danger the same as people and property which is why it is imperative those caring for them have an emergency plan in place.

Our bill is backed by the ASPCA, Humane Society Legislative Fund, The Association of Zoos and Aquariums and the Animal Welfare Institute.

The Week in Review
 
This week, Democrats are trying to fool the American people into thinking that they passed a relief bill for the coronavirus pandemic. That's just simply not true, and I am here to shed light on this monstrosity of a bill. 
 
We can begin with Nancy Pelosi's tunnel in Silicon Valley or Chuck Schumer's bridge  from New York to Canada. Either way, the bill was littered with unrelated provisions to the pandemic. In fact, only nine percent of the bill was actually allocated for public health. 
 
I voted against this bill because I was not sent to Congress to enact the liberal agenda. 
 
Not only does this bill fall severely short of addressing the public health crisis, it needlessly spends Americans hard-earned tax dollars on liberal pet projects, incentivizes longer shutdowns, kills jobs, and cuts healthcare for seniors on Medicare.
 
This bill is a sham to convince Americans they're getting a good deal when in reality, the ones getting the best deal are Biden, Pelosi, and Schumer.  
￼
 
Several of the most egregious provisions of the bill:
-Stimulus payments for illegal immigrants
-No Hyde Amendment to prevent taxpayer-funded abortions
-Planned Parenthood is eligible for Paycheck Protection Program funds
-$12B for foreign aid
-$510 billion to keep states shut down
-Includes $15 minimum wage hike, which destroys 1.4 million jobs
-Cuts healthcare for seniors on Medicare
-$135M for the National Endowment for the Arts
-$135M for the National Endowment of the Humanities
-$200M for the Institute of Museum and Library Services
-$471 billion on policies that will grow unemployment
-$112M for a Silicon Valley Tunnel
-$1.5M for a bridge to Canada from New York
-$86B for union pension bailouts
 
I will continue fighting on your behalf and calling out the actions of my colleagues who think your tax dollars were sent to Washington to support their liberal agenda. The bill now moves to the Senate and will hopefully see some significant changes that remove the pet projects and focus on public health needs. 
 
 
Persian Gulf Reflections
 
￼
 In many ways, it is hard to believe that it has been over 30 years since I deployed with my fellow Marines from 3rd Force Recon Company.
 
As a Lance Corporal at 20-years-old, I left the Marine Corps Air Station in Cherry Point, North Carolina on Christmas Eve in 1990 and landed in Saudi Arabia on Christmas day. It was just days before the beginning of the ground offensive that I turned 21 years old in the desert with my fellow Marines.
 
During our mission, I was entrusted with the squad automatic weapon and the keys to our team’s humvee. We knew we were up against the fourth largest army in the world led by the ruthless and brutal dictator Saddam Hussein. We were fully prepared for anything, from taking on the elite troops of the Iraqi army to biological and chemical attacks.
 
The quick and decisive victory over our enemies was a testament to the strength and character of our allies and U.S. forces.
 
Semper Fidelis!  
 
Biden's Health Secretary Nominee
 
President Biden's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services lacks healthcare experience, thinks Medicare-for-all should replace private health insurance, and holds radical positions on abortion, religious liberty, and immigration. He should not be rewarded with the top seat at our nation's health department. 
 
I joined many of my colleagues in requesting President Biden withdraw his nomination of Xavier Becerra. You can read our full letter by clicking the link here. 
 
 
Final Thoughts 
 
As we continue our fight against the coronavirus, I encourage you to register to get vaccinated when the opportunity presents itself. To follow vaccine distribution efforts in the state, please visit the MSDH's website.
 
It is an honor to serve you and the families of south Mississippi. If you, or someone you know, need assistance with a federal agency, please do not hesitate to give my office a call. 
 
In your service,

2/27/21 10:10,RURAL Act,"News from Representative Crawford 
￼ 
￼   ￼   ￼   ￼   ￼   ￼   
￼
RURAL Act
This week, Congressman Tom Cole and I sent a letter to President Biden requesting that households, utility companies, small businesses, and agriculture producers adversely affected by the extreme winter weather receive priority for future COVID-19 relief funding. Millions of households spent days without any means by which to heat their homes, prepare and preserve food, and some even lost access to water. We believe it is necessary to send targeted resources to the people most afflicted by the pandemic along with families experiencing more distress due to this unprecedented weather event. We urge President Biden to immediately prioritize any Congressionally authorized direct assistance to our constituents who are suffering grave loss and will continue to experience hardship as they recover from this traumatic event. You can read the letter here.
In addition to the letter, I introduced H.R. 1291, the Reinforcing Utility Restoration After Losses (RURAL) Act. This legislation gives the Department of Agriculture authority to establish a bridge loan program for rural utility companies experiencing losses in the wake of federally-declared emergencies. Companies would have access to a line of credit for low-interest loans to cover qualified losses, with partial loan forgiveness available in certain circumstances. The RURAL Act will provide a lifeline to rural utilities experiencing financial losses due to emergencies and ensure they are not forced to stop critical services in rural America.
Rural areas already experience unique daily challenges and fewer resources. With the recent extreme temperatures and increase in power outages due to unprecedented demand, we witnessed the devastation that occurs when communities cannot access critical utility services. We must assist utility providers as they work tirelessly to maintain continuity for their customers. The RURAL Act ensures that rural Americans are not without vital resources and rural service providers are bolstered during a federal emergency.

Why 28 Republicans Are Calling for an Investigation Into the National Institutes of Health
Twenty-eight Republicans on Tuesday sent a letter to Health and Human Services' (HHS) Principal Deputy Inspector General Christi Grimm asking for an investigation into the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) relationship with the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV).
According to the legislators, there is sufficient evidence calling for an independent investigation into whether or not COVID-19 was the result of a lab leak at the WIV. The members of Congress have concerns about taxpayer funds partially funding the WIV's research.

LESS THAN 9% OF $1.9 TRILLION BILL WOULD FIGHT COVID
￼
A few hours ago, in a middle-of-the-night vote, the House passed Speaker Pelosi’s $1.9 trillion bailout bill – even though more than $1 trillion in existing COVID relief funding remains unspent.
As safe and effective vaccines get us closer to ending this pandemic, we should be focused on defeating coronavirus, getting Americans back to work, and helping small businesses recover.
Instead, Democrats tossed bipartisanship aside for a rushed, one-sided, $1.9 trillion spending bill – with less than 9% actually going to fight COVID.
￼
There hasn’t even been a full accounting of $1 trillion in unspent relief funds, but Speaker Pelosi wants taxpayers to foot the bill for trillions more. That’s why this week I cosponsored a resolution requesting information from the Biden administration about the remaining funds from previous relief measures.
Despite claims the massive reconciliation bill is needed as an emergency COVID relief measure, much of the funding – $670 billion – would not be spent until fiscal year 2022 or later. 
This massive bailout will send Hoosier tax dollars to fiscally irresponsible cities and states, allow taxpayer funding for abortion, and make it harder for small businesses to hire workers and rebuild our economy.
This is not the unity President Biden once called for, it’s certainly not the targeted COVID relief our country needs.
NO TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ABORTION
￼
Speaker Pelosi’s partisan $1.9 trillion spending bill also excludes critical pro-life provisions.
Hyde protections to prohibit taxpayer funding for elective abortions have been in place under every president since Ford. Even President Biden supported them as a senator.
But now House Democrats have abandoned nearly a half-century of bipartisan consensus.
I offered an amendment in the Ways and Means Committee to preserve this important pro-life safeguard. I also joined my colleagues in submitting a similar amendment for Floor consideration. 
Democrats rejected both.
￼
You can watch my speech on the House floor urging my colleagues to join me in protecting innocent life by opposing this bill.
This is a moment that calls for healing, not destruction. It’s sad to see partisanship take priority over the most vulnerable among us: the unborn.
I believe every human life is precious, and taxpayers should not be forced to pay for the destruction of life. I won’t stop fighting to defend life and protect the conscience rights of every American.
IRAN SANCTIONS
￼
Iran took advantage of weak policies during the Obama Administration, and President Biden must not repeat those same mistakes.
I joined 42 Republicans in the House and Senate in introducing a resolution to make it clear that until the Iranian regime has put an end to its nuclear-weapon program and no longer sponsors terrorists, the U.S. must maintain sanctions.
You can read the resolution here.
SAFE & EFFECTIVE VACCINES 
￼
I’m fully confident the vaccines approved by the FDA are safe and effective, and they are the key to our nation’s recovery. I will continue working with federal, state, and local officials to ensure vaccine doses are distributed in our communities as efficiently as possible so that together we can defeat this invisible enemy. 
Indiana is continuing its phased plan to administer FDA-approved vaccines, starting with frontline health care workers, residents and staff of long-term care facilities, and now all Hoosiers aged 60 or older.
The state has opened hundreds of vaccination sites with at least one in every county, and so far 531,962 Hoosiers have been fully vaccinated. Vaccines administered by the state are free to all Indiana residents, but insurance may be charged an administrative fee.
To register and to find the nearest vaccination clinic, call 2-1-1 or visit OurShot.in.gov. The second dose will be scheduled at the clinic when the first dose is administered. A caregiver or loved one also may make an appointment on behalf of an eligible senior.
This week, the state is launching new initiatives to help get the vaccine to more Hoosiers.
Ten mobile clinics will be deployed across the state to counties where there are currently no open vaccine appointments, including one in the 2nd District! The mobile clinics will be open Thursday – Saturday from 8? a.m. to 8? p.m. for eligible Hoosiers, by appointment only.
LaPorte County Ivy Tech 3714 Franklin Street
The Homebound Hoosiers vaccination program, a state partnership with local fire and EMS departments, aims to administer vaccines directly to those who need special transportation or assistance to leave the home or have medical conditions that prohibits leaving the home. For more information and to register, contact your local Area Agency on Aging by calling 800-986-3505.
As always, it is a privilege to represent 2nd District Hoosiers in Congress.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS ADVANCE PARTISAN, PROGRESSIVE PRIORITIES 

This week, House Democrats advanced not one, but two, partisan bills that are stuffed to the brim with progressive priorities. Here’s the breakdown:

H.R. 5, the so-called “Equality” Act 
This politically motivated bill violates the First Amendment rights of Americans to freely practice and exercise ones’ religion. I opposed this legislation that:
	•	Forces schools (both public and private), churches, hospitals, businesses, and other institutions to recognize an individual’s “chosen gender” instead of their “biological sex” 
	•	Allows biological males who identify as female to compete in women’s sports competitions and use female public facilities, such as locker rooms 
	•	Forces employers to cover abortions and medical professionals to conduct or assist in performing abortions and gender transition procedures 
	•	Lays the groundwork for taxpayer-funded abortions 
￼
Congressman Allen speaks on the House floor in opposition to H.R. 1319

H.R. 1319, Pelosi’s Payoff to Progressives Act
Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democrats passed their $1.9 trillion stimulus bill out of the House. It will now go to the Senate under a “budget reconciliation” process, which means it only needs a simple majority to pass in the Senate. This is not a relief bill -- only 9% of this $1.9 trillion goes toward pandemic-related expenses. It’s riddled with progressive priorities that are unrelated to the pandemic, including:
	•	A $15 federal minimum wage requirement that will destroy 1.4 million jobs 
	•	$350 billion in blue state bailouts while leaving behind states like Georgia 
	•	Funding for a Silicon Valley underground tunnel 
Throughout this whole process, my Democrat colleagues have rejected commonsense amendments prioritizing reopening our schools – despite the CDC stating that schools can safely reopen with proper precautions. I offered an amendment that would require schools to at least offer parents the option of sending their children for in-person instruction in order to be eligible for additional stimulus funds, but Democrats blocked it.

This isn’t “COVID relief,” this package is clearly just a payoff to progressive priorities.

￼

Introducing Legislation to Encourage School Reopenings

This week I reintroduced the Educational Flexibility for Families Act. This legislation is similar to the amendment I introduced to Democrats’ budget scheme and would require K-12 schools to provide an option for students to safely attend in-person classes during the 2021 and 2022 school years in order to be eligible for additional federal assistance.

￼
Congressman Allen reintroduces the Educational Flexibility for Families Act

Earlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued additional school reopening guidance and the science is clear: Schools can safely reopen with proper precautions in place. Too many students throughout the nation have not even seen the inside of a classroom in a year and families should have the option to return their children to in-person learning. My bill prioritizes students and parents throughout the nation who are eager to return to school, not teachers’ unions who are forcing them to remain closed until their radical demands completely unrelated to the pandemic are met.

Meeting with Georgia Wing of Civil Air Patrol

￼

I’m incredibly grateful for the men and women who serve in the Georgia Wing. This week I had the opportunity to meet with members and receive an update on their activities over the past year.

House Agriculture Committee Hearing 

￼

This week, Democrats on the House Agriculture Committee held a climate hearing. Unfortunately, the extreme climate scare tactics being pushed by the left have created an epidemic of fear within our nation. But conservatives have climate solutions, including provisions in the 2018 Farm Bill that I was proud to help champion. Our farmers and ranchers are not the problem, they are the original stewards of the land and are working toward climate solutions every day. I will continue to listen to our agriculture leaders on this important topic.

COVID-19 Vaccine Update

Governor Brian Kemp announced this week that starting March 8th, Pre-K-12 educators and staff, adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities and their caregivers, and parents of children with complex medical conditions will be eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. This is great news as we continue to ramp up efforts to ensure that every Georgian who wants a vaccine is able to get one.

ICYMI: I held a telephone town hall to answer questions from GA-12 constituents

￼
￼
￼

I held a telephone town hall Tuesday night to update residents of #GA12 about President Biden’s executive orders, COVID-19 relief, legislation to reopen schools, and more. For those who were unable to participate, here are some of the highlights.

You can sign up to participate in future telephone town halls here.

￼

No American should be forced to pay union dues as a condition of employment. Forced unionism goes against every aspect of our Constitution and the beliefs of our Founding Fathers. 

That is why I am a proud original cosponsor of H.R. 1275, the National Right to Work Act. This legislation repeals the provision in federal law that allows unions to take dues from an employee’s paycheck.

As always, my office is here to help. You can email me ⇒ HERE, contact any of our offices or join the conversation on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.

2/27/21 10:50,PASSED: The American Rescue Plan,"￼
Dear Friend,
 
When I voted in December for the most recent COVID-19 relief package, I promised you that it was a down payment and that I would immediately begin work on another round of relief that actually meets the needs of the American people.
 
Last night, I voted to keep that promise when the House passed President Biden’s American Rescue Plan. This historic legislation will deliver for working families across the Third District and set our nation on course to defeat the virus, get our kids safely back into the classroom, and rebuild our economy.
 
Specifically, the American Rescue Plan provides:
	•	Survival Checks: Fulfills President Biden’s promise to provide $2,000 in direct assistance to households by providing $1,400 checks per person, following the $600 down payment passed in December;
	•	Extended Unemployment: Extends access to unemployment benefits beyond the March 14th expiration date for workers laid off as a result of the pandemic and increases the critical monthly supplemental benefit to $400;
	•	Food and Housing Assistance: Makes bold investments in food assistance and child nutrition programs, including increasing the maximum SNAP benefit through September, and provides more than $40 billion for housing programs to help people afford their rent, mortgage, and utility payments;
	•	Direct Assistance to Vulnerable Families: Establishes a Pandemic Emergency Fund to allocate funding directly to states like ours to provide emergency assistance to low-income families with children;
	•	Resources for National Vaccination Plan: Provides more than $20 billion to establish a National COVID-19 Vaccination Program and improve the administration and distribution of vaccines, including allocating funds for FEMA vaccination sites across the country and strengthening the CDC’s ability to promote, distribute, monitor, and track COVID-19 vaccines;
	•	Funding Necessary to Reopen Schools: Allocates nearly $130 billion, which will be made available to states and school districts so they can work with public health experts to ensure the safe return of students and educators. This provision of the bill will deliver an estimated $1.9 billion to Massachusetts K-12 schools and another $13.6 million for Head Start programs;
	•	Support for Small Businesses and Nonprofits: Increases Paycheck Protection Program funding and expands eligibility to ensure it reaches nonprofits of all sizes and types while also creating a $25 billion Restaurant Revitalization Fund to offer assistance to restaurants and bars with 20 or fewer locations that have been hit hard by the pandemic;
	•	And MUCH MORE.
This legislation now moves to the Senate, where it should be taken up without delay so we can get it to President Biden’s desk as soon as possible. Rest assured that I will keep you updated regarding developments on the American Rescue Plan.
 
If I or anyone our team can be of any assistance in the meantime, please don’t hesitate to reach out via phone at 978-459-0101 or email at Rep.LoriTrahan@mail.house.gov.

2/27/21 11:02,"Floor Wrap-Up: $1.9 Trillion COVID Bill, ""Equality"" Act, and Public Lands Package","
 
 
 

Hello from Washington, DC.


This was a busy week in Washington, but unfortunately, Speaker Pelosi had us voting on more of her liberal messaging bills that will hurt rural Coloradans, jeopardize the work of religious organizations, and saddle our children and grandchildren with more debt. 

I spoke with Charles Payne on Fox Business about Speaker Pelosi's 'Pork-Filled' COVID bill, watch the full interview below:
 

Here are just a few of the most ridiculous pieces of pork Pelosi shoved into the American Recovery Act: 
 
	•	A $15 federal minimum wage mandate that will eliminate 1.4 million jobs
	•	$350 billion bailout for blue states
	•	$129 billion for public schools whether or not they have reopened
	•	$1 billion for 'racial justice' for farmers
	•	$112 million for a California rail project in Silicon Valley
	•	$200 million for museums and libraries
	•	$750 million for 'global health'
	•	$750 million for Native American housing
	•	$1.5 million to Senator Schumer’s home state for a pet project
 
And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. This bill will drastically increase our national debt by nearly $2 trillion. Not to mention, it also cuts $36 million from Medicare. 
 
Do you want to know the craziest part? 
 
We still have $1 trillion—yes, that's trillion with a ""T""—left in unspent funds from previous COVID legislation. That’s why I voted against the Democrats' pork-filled COVID bill.


I joined my fellow Colorado Republicans in voting “NO” on the Democrats’ Federal Land Grab package: 
 

Did you know the federal government already owns 35.9% of Colorado?

The federal land grab package, HR 803, only gives more power to bureaucrats in Washington to enforce onerous restrictions and kill energy jobs. This package includes the text of several pieces of legislation including Rep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.)’s Colorado Wilderness Act of 2021 and Rep. Joe Neguse (D-Colo.)’s Colorado Outdoor Recreation and Economy Act. Combined, these bills will create restrictions on over one million acres of land, much of which will be new wilderness – the most restrictive federal land use classification. Click here to read my full statement. 

I voted against Speaker Pelosi’s 'Equality' Act:
 

On Thursday, the House voted on HR 5, the so-called 'Equality' Act. This bill guts religious protections and threatens constitutional freedoms with drastic changes to federal civil rights laws. Not only will this legislation force religious charities to violate their deeply held beliefs and shut down faith-based adoption agencies, but it also forces women and girls to compete against biological men and hurt their athletic and scholarship opportunities. 

Equality for some is equality for none. It goes without saying that we should never tolerate prejudice or intolerance for a group of individuals. HR 5 is a laundry list of bad policies with serious repercussions for women, people of faith, churches, and charitable organizations.  

The Equality Act is anything but — and that is why I voted against it.

If you have any questions or concerns about my voting record please reach out to my office to leave a comment. Your opinion is important to me as I work to effectively represent you in Washington.

God Bless,

2/27/21 11:13,A Plan to End the Pandemic,"￼ 
  

Dear Neighbors,
Last night, the House passed the American Rescue Plan that struggling families desperately need to help stay afloat during this ongoing public health and economic crisis. This legislation implements a national plan to crush the COVID-19 pandemic. It provides the tools and resources we need to ramp up distribution and administration of lifesaving vaccines and testing to track and trace new hotspots before they become larger outbreaks.  
The bill expands access to quality, affordable health care coverage to millions of Americans who lack access to care in the midst of the pandemic. The American Rescue Plan also includes vital assistance to help families keep the lights on, the heat working, the water running, and to expand internet connectivity to help students and teachers without home internet access. It will also deliver critical aid to our state and local governments. Read more here
My Energy and Commerce Committee held a hearing this week with vaccine manufacturers to hear what steps each company is taking to rapidly expand vaccine production, what hurdles might stand in the way, and what additional help they need to increase supply. Widespread access to vaccines and ensuring reliable production lines are in place is essential to achieve herd immunity and end this pandemic. Read more here
I also held another hearing on disinformation and extremism that are a threat to our nation. It has been especially dangerous over the past year when media outlets downplayed the seriousness of the COVID-19 pandemic, peddled ineffective treatments, and mocked effective precautionary measures. We owe it to our constituents and our democracy to examine how and why disinformation is being aired on traditional media and social media. Read more here
A Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory panel approved Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine on Friday. Formal emergency use authorization from FDA is expected over the weekend. New Jersey should receive an initial shipment of roughly 70,000 Johnson & Johnson vaccine doses once the vaccine receives approval. 
Local COVID-19 Announcements
Religious services and celebrations can now operate at 50% capacity of the room in which they are held with no cap on the number of individuals permitted to attend.
Indoor and outdoor collegiate sports practices and competitions may now allow two parents or guardians per participating athlete as spectators.
Effective March 1st, sports and entertainment venues with a fixed-seating capacity of over 5,000 people may open for spectators – 10% capacity for indoor venues and 15% capacity for outdoor venues.

2/27/21 11:50,Getting K-12 Schools Re-opened + Increasing the Minimum Wage,"￼
￼    February 22 - February 26, 2021 
This week, Senator Romney and a group of colleagues unveiled the Higher Wages for American Workers Act—legislation to gradually raise the federal minimum wage to $10/hour and require employers to use E-Verify to ensure jobs go to legal workers. Unlike Democrats' plan to increase wages to $15/hour, the group's proposal protects small businesses and would not cost jobs. Discussions also continued this week about the next phase of COVID-19 relief. In an op-ed, Senator Romney urged the Administration to come to the table to negotiate a bipartisan package to provide need-based relief. He also pressed the Administration to follow the science, not teachers unions, in getting K-12 schools open. Senator Romney provided these updates, and more, when he reported to the Utah legislature this week. Keep scrolling for a brief recap of the week:  
￼
￼
 
￼
  It’s been more than a decade since the federal minimum wage has been increased, leaving millions of Americans struggling to make ends meet. However, the Administration's proposal to increase the federal minimum wage to $15/hour would cost nearly 1.4 million jobs. Senator Romney teamed up with Senators Cotton (R-AR), Capito (R-WV), Collins (R-ME), and Portman (R-OH) to introduce the Higher Wages for American Workers Act, a proposal to raise wages for nearly 3.5 million workers without costing jobs. Additionally, the legislation would require employers to use E-Verify to ensure that businesses only hire legal workers—eliminating a key driver of illegal immigration. More information on the proposal can be found here.  
￼
 
￼
  Full story by Dennis Romboy here.    ￼    More than one-third of funding in the Administration's proposed COVID-19 package wouldn’t be spent until 2022 or later, undermining their claim that the massive price tag is justified for urgent pandemic-related needs. The next relief package should be targeted and bipartisan. Senator Romney wrote an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal urging the Administration to come to the table to negotiate the next COVID-19 package, saying Senate Republicans ""stand ready to negotiate a plan that helps America recover, both physically and financially, from this dread disease. We are willing to compromise in an attempt to get the administration to come down from its ill-considered $1.9 trillion plan and instead provide need-based relief.""

  Full opinion by Senator Romney here.   
￼
  The Administration’s COVID-19 proposal calls for $170 billion for education, yet has no realistic plan to re-open K-12 schools. During a Senate Health Committee hearing, Senator Romney pressed witnesses about the Administration's plan for re-opening schools given that data does not indicate COVID-19 spikes in open schools. The timetable for opening schools should be dictated by science, not teachers unions. Senator Romney also asked the Administration's witnesses about plans to curb the youth vaping epidemic.  During a separate Health Committee hearing, Senator Romney asked Xavier Becerra, the Administration's nominee for HHS Secretary, to explain his stance on abortion—particularly his previous votes in support of partial-birth abortions. ""There are areas in which we can find common ground—but this isn’t one of them,"" Senator Romney said. ""There is no common ground here.""

￼
  
￼
  Confucius Institutes are a propaganda tool of the Chinese Communist Party. Senator Romney teamed up with Senators Rubio (R-FL), Grassley (R-IA), and Portman (R-OH) in sending a letter urging the Biden Administration to implement the proposed rule requiring U.S. academic institutions disclose their relationships with Confucius Institutes.  “We have significant concerns regarding the CCP’s nefarious actions and urge you to follow through on your commitments to advancing the interests of the American people as we collectively respond to the challenge that the CCP poses,” the senators wrote. “We believe it is critically important to better understand and reduce the CCP’s influence on the American people, including through the Hanban, its propaganda arm that runs Confucius Institutes through the PRC Ministry of Education. The proposed rule is a necessary step in that effort and would bring needed transparency to Confucius Institutes.”   
￼
  With two-thirds of Utah held as public land, the Secure Rural Schools program is an essential funding source for schools in Utah’s rural communities, which have also been hit especially hard by the health and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Senator Romney joined a large bipartisan group of colleagues to introduce legislation to reauthorize the SRS program through September 2022. It is necessary for Congress to reauthorize the SRS program, and Senator Romney will continue pushing to ensure that Congress sees it through.

February 27, 2021
 
Dear Friends,
 
This week has brought tremendous loss but also encouraging news in our effort to crush this pandemic and heal as a nation. As of Monday, just over a year after our nation’s first confirmed COVID-19-related death, we hit the heartbreaking milestone of more than 500,000 Americans lost to this virus. My heart breaks for the families, friends, and loved ones of the half-million Americans who have died as a result of COVID-19. This tragic loss of life is a solemn reminder that although we have made great strides towards crushing this virus, the pandemic is not over.
  
￼
I joined my colleagues and the nation in mourning the 500,000 Americans lost to COVID-19.
  
 
But here's the good news, this week, we also moved one step closer towards the authorization of a third safe, effective COVID-19 vaccine. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine could be a game-changer in our nation’s response to this pandemic — especially for rural and difficult to reach communities. The anticipation of a third coronavirus vaccine in the U.S. is a hopeful sign that we will be able to continue picking up the pace to get more vaccines into the arms of Americans quickly and efficiently.
 
While I am encouraged by the significant increase in the number of vaccines distributed to states under the Biden administration — an increase of nearly 70% in the past five weeks — we are not out of this crisis yet. Granite State doctors, nurses, and health care workers have gone above and beyond the call of duty and faced serious challenges during the COVID-19 surge of the past three months. The best way we can honor their service is to maintain the precautions that have allowed us to reduce our COVID-19 numbers and keep our communities safe. Social distancing and mask-wearing are our best defenses until the COVID-19 vaccine is widely distributed. 
 
There is light at the end of the tunnel and by working together, relying on science, and following the guidance of public health officials, we will have brighter days ahead.
  
 
Making Progress in Congress
 
  
￼
Friday morning I spoke on the House Floor to urge my colleagues to pass this critical relief legislation.
  
 
Hardworking Granite State families, small businesses, health care workers, and first responders are hurting because of the COVID-19 public health and economic crisis. Support cannot come soon enough, and I’m pleased the House took action and passed the American Rescue Plan Act, much-needed and forward-looking legislation that included two of my bills to bolster and quicken our nationwide vaccine rollout — the Immunization Infrastructure Modernization Act and the Coronavirus Vaccine and Therapeutic Development Act. 
 
The American Rescue Plan will provide critical resources for our NH communities to build back from this pandemic. The plan includes funding to re-open schools safely to get students back into classrooms, extend key relief to small businesses to keep employees on staff, and ensure our frontline workers and first responders have the supplies they need to safely do their jobs and protect our communities. Additionally, this bill will provide funding to bolster our nationwide vaccine rollout and ensure that the United States is able to mass-produce and administer COVID-19 vaccines to all Americans. 
 
There’s a lot of work to be done, and I’m committed to building back better so no one is left behind as we recover from this pandemic.
  
 
￼
 
I questioned vaccine manufacturers about our nation’s production capacity.
  
 
Although I have concerns about our nation’s COVID vaccine manufacturing capacity and increasing demand from our limited supply, this week’s Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hearing and the testimony from leading vaccine producers — including Moderna and Pfizer who pledged to boost supply to the U.S. — made me proud of what our country has accomplished in our response to this pandemic, and hopeful for our ability to limit the threat of the new variants.
 
Safe, effective COVID-19 vaccines continue to be some of our best tools for crushing this pandemic — but, unless we are able to ramp up production and get shots into arms across the country efficiently and equitably, we will continue to be one step behind the virus. I will continue working in Congress to advance legislation to bolster our COVID-19 vaccine production and distribution, ensure that our supply meets the demands of this public health crisis, and expand access to life-saving vaccines and therapeutics so no one is left behind as we recover from this pandemic.
  
 
￼
 
I questioned experts on how we can mitigate climate change’s worst effects.
  
 
Climate change short-circuits New Hampshire’s maple-sugaring season, complicates the growing season for our farmers, and brings more invasive species to our forests. During Thursday’s Agriculture Committee hearing on the role of climate change in the agriculture and forestry industries, I questioned experts about how climate change threatens our economy and our livelihoods, and how we can mitigate its worst effects. 
 
I will continue working in Congress, through my role on the House Agriculture Committee and with the Biden-Harris administration to ensure our agriculture and forestry sectors are equipped with the resources, science, and federal support to address climate change and continue serving our communities for generations to come. Just this week, the EPA took important steps on dangerous PFAS and forever chemicals, which impact families throughout New Hampshire. I’ve worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle in Congress to address PFAS, and I urge the administration to take immediate action to establish strict PFAS drinking water standards that will protect families and hold contaminators accountable.
  
 
￼
 
I voted in favor of the Equality Act to help ensure equal rights and justice for all.
  
 
No one should be denied housing, a job, education, or the opportunity to apply for federal funding because of who they are or who they love. And this week, the House passed the Equality Act to extend anti-discrimination protections to LGBTQ Americans and guarantee full federal civil rights protections. I’m proud to join my colleagues in supporting this legislation, and I will continue working to ensure equal rights and justice for all.
  
￼
This week, I helped reintroduce the END Child Exploitation Act.
  
 
Ensuring the safety and wellbeing of children in New Hampshire and across the country is one of my top priorities, and we must do more to safeguard them from exploitation online. 
 
This week, I was proud to help reintroduce the END Child Exploitation Act — commonsense, bipartisan legislation to help law enforcement and technology companies respond to child sexual abuse images, hold perpetrators accountable, and protect Granite State children and communities. I urge my colleagues to support this helpful bill to keep children across our country safe.
  
 
Hope on the Homefront
 
  
￼
The Treasury Department took swift action and listened to our calls to ensure flexibility in federal rental assistance funds.
  
 
There is no one-size-fits-all solution for those struggling to afford essential services or keep a roof over their head during this public health and economic crisis, and our federal COVID-19 response must reflect the diverse needs of our communities. I’m pleased the Treasury Department took swift action and listened to our calls to ensure flexibility in federal rental assistance funds.
 
Also this week, New Hampshire announced a new program to help with lapsed rental and utility payments that will become available in the next few weeks. I will continue working in Congress and with the Biden-Harris administration to provide crucial relief to those who need it most in New Hampshire and across the country. We must ensure Granite Staters have access to the support they need throughout the ongoing pandemic.
  
￼
I’m proud to advocate for NH restaurants in Congress.
  
 
Our Granite State restaurants and foodservice industry were hit hard by the COVID-19 public health and economic crisis. This week, by advancing the American Rescue Plan, we got one step closer to ensure these businesses have sufficient relief to weather this storm and continue serving our communities.
 
I'm proud to advocate for these New Hampshire businesses and their employees in Congress, and to support them at home!
  
￼
The 2021 Congressional Art Competition for New Hampshire’s Second District is now open!
  
 
Each spring, a nation-wide high school arts competition is sponsored by the U.S. House of Representatives. The annual Congressional Art Competition is an opportunity for high school students in New Hampshire’s Second District to showcase their artistic abilities!
 
I invite current high school students within New Hampshire’s Second Congressional District to participate in this year’s competition. The overall winner of our district's competition will be displayed for one year in the U.S. Capitol as well as the House Congressional Art Competition webpage. For safety reasons because of the COVID-19 pandemic, art submissions for the 2021 contest must be made virtually.
 
For information about the rules and how to enter, head to my website!
 
  
￼
We will get through this crisis, together.
  
 
The empathy, compassion, and sense of community that Granite Staters and New England neighbors have demonstrated during this crisis have been heartwarming. Whether it’s members of the New Hampshire National Guard putting their lives on hold to help others, or generous donations for those feeding the hungry, I know we will get through this stronger than ever.
  
 
News You Can Use
 
  
￼
The Biden administration extended resources for small businesses.
  
 
Our Main Street businesses are the backbone of our economy in New Hampshire, but the COVID-19 pandemic has had a heavy toll on small businesses. Starting this past Wednesday, the Biden administration has opened a window for businesses with fewer than 20 employees to have exclusive access to the Paycheck Protection Program for 14 days, from February 24 - March 10, 2021.

Submit your best photos to my 2021 Winter Photo Contest!
  
 
If you live in New Hampshire’s 2nd District and enjoy photography, I invite you to enter my 2021 Winter Photo Contest! From now through Monday, March 1st at 11:59 PM, my office is accepting submissions of images and scenery to highlight the Granite State's natural beauty. Learn more about how to submit your photos on my website.
 
A program at the UpREACH Therapeutic Equestrian Center in Goffstown that is working to help ease tension for first responders and front-line workers by spending time with horses has been extended into April and possibly longer if sponsors step forward. The program offers free equestrian therapy sessions to help those on the frontlines during the COVID-19 crisis.
 
COVID-19 testing can be a helpful tool to identify active cases and stop the spread of the coronavirus, and advancing technology is making it easier than ever. A mobile COVID-19 testing lab is now offering its services to the public at the Mall of New Hampshire, specifically, those who need PCR results quickly, sometimes in just 30 minutes.
 
Sign-ups for Phase 1B of New Hampshire’s COVID-19 vaccination process are now open.
 
Phase 1B opens vaccine registration to:
—Those 65 years or older
—Those under 65 but medically vulnerable
—Residents or staff of residential facilities
—Correctional officers working in facilities 
 
Confirm your eligibility and register for your vaccination on www.vaccines.nh.gov/. If you need assistance, you can call 2-1-1 for help. 
 
As always, the CDC and the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services are the best resources to turn to during the COVID-19 public health emergency. If you are sick, stay home and call your health care provider. If you live in NH and have questions about coronavirus, dial 2-1-1 or visit CDC.gov for more information.
 
To stay updated on my work in Congress and around the Granite State, as well as for important information and resources, like my page on Facebook and follow me on Twitter. 
 
As we continue working to heal from COVID-19, remember that hope and brighter days are on the way! We’re all in this together, and we will come out stronger on the other side. I hope you have a safe and fun weekend!
 
Sincerely, 
 
Annie

HAPPENING IN THE HOUSE
This week, the House passed H.R. 5, the Equality Act, which would withhold federal funding from any college or university that does not allow biological men to compete in women's sports. Allowing transgender individuals to compete in women’s sports is unfair, unsafe, and completely undermines the intent of Title IX which was put in place to protect women and girls. As the father of three girls involved in wrestling, I want them to be able to compete on a level playing field. If our laws do not recognize the biological difference between men and women, female athletes will be the ones to suffer the consequences.
 
Check out my most recent ""Mullin it Over"" column where I explain the history of Title IX and outline how H.R. 5 seeks to undermine women's participation in school sports.
￼
 
BIDEN BAILOUT DOESN'T ADD UP
The Biden Bailout is exactly what it sounds like: a bill full of wasteful government spending, blue state bailouts, and Democratic wish list items that hinder our economic recovery from the pandemic. Of the $1.9 trillion, only 9 percent will actually go to COVID relief and 45 percent isn’t even going to be used this year. That is unacceptable and reckless. With $1 trillion from previously enacted relief bills still unspent, we should be focusing on getting that relief to those who need it most and getting our economy fully reopened. 
￼
 
This 1.9 trillion bailout includes: 
	•	$510 billion for Democrat-run states that chose to shut down
	•	$471 billion for liberal policies that destroy jobs 
	•	$422 billion for another round of direct government payments to individuals 
	•	$325 billion for non-COVID-19 Democratic wish list items 
	•	$160 billion for actually combatting COVID-19 
	•	$12 billion in foreign aid
	•	And a federal mandate forcing states to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour
This should be simple. Any pandemic relief legislation must be temporary and directly tied to COVID-19.

""IN AMERICA WE'RE ABLE TO DEBATE, BUT WHAT WE SHOULDN'T DO IS HATE""
This week, House Energy and Commerce Committee Democrats attempted to bully private media companies into silence for their opposing views. This was yet another attempt by the Pelosi Democrats to eliminate any points of view that differ from their socialist narrative. Freedom of speech is a right and it must be protected. I was honored to participate in this hearing and point out the clear hypocrisy that exists within left-wing media.

GOLD STAR FAMILIES FELLOWSHIP
My team is seeking a Gold Star Family Member for a fellowship in our Claremore office. I am proud to partner with the House to provide employment opportunities for families whose loved ones have paid the ultimate sacrifice to protect our nation. The Gold Star Family Member Program was established by the House of Representatives to ensure that families of fallen service members have access to employment in addition to the care and services they need. I encourage all eligible to apply!

WHERE IN DISTRICT 2? 
Communities all across the Second Congressional District of Oklahoma are full of things that make them unique and I want to highlight some of them. Every week on my Facebook page, I will post an up-close photo of a landmark somewhere in the district with a clue to where it is. I encourage everyone to put their best guess in the comments. The correct answer will be right here, in my weekly e-newsletter.

2/27/21 12:03,Rep. Grothman Newsletter- Air Americans,"￼

 
Air Americans
 
Between 1950 and 1976, a group of approximately 1,000 U.S. citizens worked for Air America, which was portrayed as a privately-owned company carrying out flight operations during the Cold War. Now-declassified documents have revealed that Air America was wholly owned and controlled by the U.S. government – meaning these brave Americans were federal employees under the law at the time they worked. 
 
Due to the secretive nature of their work and a technicality within the government bureaucracy, however, these individuals are not officially recognized as former federal employees are not afforded federal retirement benefits.
 
On Wednesday, I introduced the Air America Act, which currently has 60 bipartisan cosponsors. My bill will correct this inequity suffered by the brave Americans who are former employees of Air America by ensuring they receive the federal retirement benefits and recognition they have earned. Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) introduced a companion version of this bill in the U.S. Senate, which is currently cosponsored by a bipartisan group of 27 Senators.
 
Congress has twice passed corrective legislation for other covert CIA-affiliated groups and it is not right to continue to ignore Air Americans. These patriots risked their lives, many of them giving their life, fighting communism in the same way members of the Air Force did. I am honored that so many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are joining me to support these heroes. Now is the time to properly recognize Air Americans for their service to our country.
  
 
Lt. Col. James ""Maggie"" Megellas
 
Let me briefly tell you the story of Fond du Lac native James ""Maggie"" Megellas.
 
On January 28, 1945, First Lieutenant Megellas led his platoon in a successful attack on an enemy battalion near Herresbach, Belgium, despite being outnumbered ten-to-one. After the attack, he advanced his platoon towards the town when a German Mark V Panther tank pinned them down. Megellas weathered enemy fire to attack and destroy the tank himself with just two grenades and his submachine gun. He then led his platoon to secure Herresbach for advancing Allied forces. Under Megellas’ command, his platoon did not suffer a single casualty that day. Megellas would go on to become the most-decorated soldier from the 82nd Airborne Division, receiving the Distinguished Service Cross and the Silver Star for his actions during the Battle of the Bulge. Sadly, Maggie passed away last year at his home in Colleyville, TX at the age of 103.
 
I am proud to, once again, introduce a legislation that would authorize the President to award Lt. Col. Megellas the Medal of Honor, America's highest military honor, for his heroic efforts to go above and beyond the normal call of duty. My bipartisan bill is cosponsored by every member of Wisconsin's House delegation, Congressman Ron Kind (D-WI-03), Congresswoman Gwen Moore (D-WI-04), Congressman Mark Pocan (D-WI-02), Congressman Mike Gallagher (R-WI-08), Congressman Bryan Steil (R-WI-01), Congressman Tom Tiffany (R-WI-07), Congressman Scott Fitzgerald (R-WI-05), as well as Congresswoman Beth Van Duyne (R-TX), who represents Colleyville, TX. Senator Ron Johnson introduced a companion bill in the U.S. Senate that has bipartisan support from Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) and Senator John Cornyn (R-TX).
 
Maggie deserves to be recognized with the Medal of Honor. His story is amazing and an example of the unbreakable American spirit. I have been sharing Maggie's story with my other Congressional colleagues and hope that one day soon, we will pass this bill and give Lt. Col. James ""Maggie"" Megellas the Medal of Honor he so deserves.

￼

 
The Democrats' ""COVID Stimulus"" is Neither
 
 
Americans are desperate for the COVID-19 vaccine. Our main street businesses are hurting. Millions of Americans are still out of work. Schools remain closed across the nation. 
 
These are the real problems we’re facing. And yet, the Democrats' partisan proposal ignores them all. 
 
￼
WATCH: Congressman Brady speaks on the floor against the Democrat’s partisan payoff bill.
 
In fact, only 9% of the $1.9 trillion in this bill is spent on combating the virus. The truth is, the Democrats' ""COVID stimulus"" is neither. 
 
Instead of creating jobs, the Democrats are dishing out money to special interest groups, including: 
	•	$350 billion bailout for blue states 
	•	$12 billion for foreign aid
	•	$100M for a rail project to Silicon Valley 
	•	$135 million for the National Endowment for the Humanities 
	•	$50M for environmental justice grants 
	•	$1.5M for a bridge connecting Canada to NY 
	•	And more….
It doesn’t have to be this way. For the last five COVID-19 emergency aid bills Republicans and Democrats worked together, and were able to deliver the largest recovery package in American history – over $3.5 trillion. But this time, by refusing to work together, President Joe Biden and Democrats in Congress are punishing the American people. 
 
￼
 
Instead of this political payoff, let’s find common ground on what’s truly urgent: crushing the virus, rebuilding this economy, saving Main Street businesses and getting people back to work.

 Thought of the day: “The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others.” ― Mahatma Gandhi  
￼
Last night, the U.S. House of Representatives voted to pass the American Rescue Plan, sending the relief package over to the U.S. Senate for final consideration. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said the Senate will pass the relief package by March 14, before unemployment assistance for over 18 million Americans is due to expire. 
The American Rescue Plan will deliver immediate relief to millions of Americans and small businesses, including:
	•	$1,400 survival checks for Americans
	•	Funding to SAFELY reopen schools and keep them open
	•	Takes action to speed up COVD-19 vaccinations
	•	Increases COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, and mitigation
	•	Extends and increases unemployment assistance
	•	Expands health care access and lowers costs
	•	Increases housing and nutrition assistance
	•	Expands access to affordable childcare
	•	Provides support for frontline workers
And much more focused on helping us crush COVID and build back our economy.  

Coronavirus Update

On Friday, Michigan reported 1,073 new cases of COVID-19 and 1 new death, bringing the state’s total cases to 586,425 and deaths to 15,454. Our efforts to defeat this virus are working, but we can’t become complacent. We can’t relax now that Michigan’s numbers are continuing to trend in hopeful directions. Now we must really commit to following CDC guidelines, so we don’t erase the progress we’ve made, especially with more contagious variants of COVID spreading in our state. We’ve got to keep wearing our masks (two is better than one, according to the CDC), keeping our physical distance, and washing our hands.  
On Friday, Michigan reported 2,621,225 COVID vaccines have been distributed and, of that, 2,131,955 vaccines have been administered. We continue to have many issues with the rollout of the vaccine—from seniors unsure of how to make an appointment, to shortages in vaccines causing health systems to cancel appointments. We’ve got to better communicate how eligible people can get vaccination appointments and really work to address vaccine shortages.
Yesterday, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Advisory Board voted unanimously to approve Johnson & Johnson’s single-dose COVID-19 vaccine, paving the way for the US’s third COVID, and first single-dose, vaccine. The FDA will now work quickly to authorize the vaccine for emergency use, which may come as soon as today. The addition of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine will help us continue to stomp down case numbers and prevent serious illness due to the virus, once authorized.
COVID-19 Vaccine Information
Michigan is busy at work distributing and administering COVID vaccines. More information can be found by following the links below.
Washtenaw County Vaccine Information

2/27/21 12:33,A Rescue Plan for America,"￼
Services  |   Contact  |   Events 
SUBSCRIBE 

Dear Friends,  
As the pandemic continues to take lives and hurt Coloradans' livelihoods, providing robust economic relief is our number one priority. This week, we passed the American Rescue Plan through the House, a comprehensive COVID-19 relief plan to crush the virus, return children safely to the classroom, get vaccines to the people, put dollars into families’ pockets and put people back to work. 
 
The plan will mount a national vaccination program that includes setting up community vaccination sites nationwide. It will deliver immediate relief to working families bearing the brunt of the crisis through $1400 checks for eligible Americans, direct housing, and nutrition assistance and it will provide crucial support for the hardest-hit small businesses through EIDL grants, expanded Payroll Protection Program eligibility, and more. 
 
When America is hurting, we cannot turn our backs. This plan will address both the public health and economic needs produced by this crisis and ensure we are answering the many devastating impacts our communities have witnessed over the last year—feeding hungry kids and families, supporting workers who have been laid off and businesses who are struggling and providing the necessary infrastructure to get Americans vaccinated and our economy reopened as quickly as is safe.
 
This bill now heads to the Senate for approval, and we'll be in touch in the coming weeks with more information on how to access aspects of this plan. 
 
WHAT ELSE HAVE WE BEEN WORKING ON?
	•	On Monday, March 1st. I will be hosting a Telephone Townhall at 6:30pm MT to give updates on COVID relief, wildfire recovery, our efforts to preserve Colorado public lands, and more! You can sign up and live stream the event at neguse.house.gov/live.   
	•	I wrote FEMA to request that surveillance testing be included as a reimbursable expense to support teachers and students and assist in Colorado's efforts to reopen our economy.   
	•	We passed the Equality Act, critial legislation that will ensure LGBTQ+ individuals are afforded the same protections against discrimination as every other American. The legislation would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other existing laws to expand these rights.   
	•	We introduced the Fairness in Social Security Act, which was inspired by a Silverthorne constituent, to address a faulty IRS rule to ensure individuals who rely on social security are not left owing huge tax bills. 
As always we are so grateful for your input and feedback. Please contact my office if you have ideas on how to improve the lives of Coloradans and Americans, as well as if you need any help with a federal agency.
 
Stay safe and healthy as we welcome our state’s snowiest month next week!
 
Sincerely,
￼

A message from 
Congresswoman Tenney:

Thank you for signing up for my weekly e-newsletter. I'm looking forward to keeping you updated on my work in Congress and throughout the 22nd District. It's a privilege to represent you in Congress, where my priority will always be to advance compassionate policies that restore opportunity and prosperity for Upstate families, small businesses and seniors. If my office can ever be of service to you, please do not hesitate to contact us.
 
 
 
 
 
Speaker Pelosi’s spending bill was focused more on partisan priorities than our Nation’s COVID recovery. Read about why I voted ""No.""

The unprecedented COVID-19 crisis demands a robust, targeted response from the federal government. But only 9% of the funding in Speaker Pelosi's proposed $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill was actually for COVID relief. The rest was a grab bag of nearly $1 trillion in pork and other provisions that were totally unrelated to COVID - things like $100 million for a train project in Silicon Valley. Nancy Pelosi used this bill as cover to push a partisan agenda rather than build on areas of bipartisan consensus to deliver real relief to American families, which is why I voted against it. I encourage you to read my detailed explanation here. My priority in Congress is unchanged: to deliver targeted relief to the constituents I represent. I urge my Democratic colleagues to put partisan wish lists on hold and focus on getting our nation through this unprecedented challenge. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rep. Tenney named to Small Business and Foreign Affairs Committees, attends first Committee hearings this week

Last week I was named to the House Small Business Committee and the Foreign Affairs Committee. I'm proud to have been named to these important committees, and will use my positions to continue fighting for the 22nd Congressional District. My priorities include delivering relief to small businesses, countering China's theft of American intellectual property, protecting jobs, and bringing back American manufacturing. Read more about my priorities. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rep. Tenney shares testimony from NY22 small businesses at Committee hearing

Earlier this week I attended my first Small Business Committee meeting, which was focused on a proposal by House Democrats to increase the minimum wage. While the proposal may be well-intentioned, I highlighted during the hearing how a minimum wage hike would hurt small businesses as well as lesser-skilled workers throughout New York. It would also cost the economy 1.4 million jobs. I shared testimony from A&P Master Images, a small business in Utica, New York. Owners Howard and Amanda Potter stated a wage hike could be catastrophic for their small manufacturing company. Watch my opening remarks here. 
 
 

Foreign Affairs Committee Adopts Two Bills on Burma Co-Sponsored by Rep. Tenney

Utica, New York is home to more than 4,000 Burmese refugees, many who still have family in Burma. Earlier this month, Burma's military overthrew the civilian-led government, leading to tragic violence across the country. I recently met with a group of Burmese refugees from Utica to learn more about their concerns and underscore my commitment to addressing this issue. Earlier this month I wrote a letter to Secretary of State Tony Blinken calling on the Biden Administration to sanction those responsible for the coup. This week the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed two bills I supported to condemn the coup and hold those responsible for it accountable. Read my full statement here. 
 
 

House Democrats refuse to consider Rep. Tenney's ""Cuomo Accountability Amendment"" to increase transparency

I introduced a commonsense amendment to require Governor Cuomo and every Governor across the country to comply with requests for information from federal agencies regarding COVID-19 data. House Republican Whip Steve Scalise (LA) and New York Representatives Elise Stefanik, Andrew Garbarino, and Lee Zeldin co-sponsored this amendment. House Democrats unfortunately prevented this amendment from even being considered for a vote. 
 

Rep. Tenney demands Governor Cuomo's resignation after latest allegations of sexual harassment by former aide

The allegations of sexual harassment made against Governor Cuomo are deeply disturbing and expose the climate of fear, bullying, and abuse that Governor Cuomo has used to silence critics and escape accountability. New Yorkers have lost faith in Governor Cuomo and this week I renewed my repeated calls for him to resign. If he refuses, Governor Cuomo must be impeached by the New York State Legislature. His crimes must be fully investigated to shed light on the full extent of his wrongdoing. Read my full statement. 
 

 

NY22 Resident Jessie Clemente turns 103

This week it was such a privilege to wish Utica, New York resident Jessie Clemente a Happy Birthday from the House Floor of Congress. Jessie turned 103 this week and celebrated the momentous occasion with her family. Happy Birthday, Jessie!
 

Rep. Tenney visits Rome Lab for an update on its important work
 
 
 
 
Rome Lab is an engine of growth and prosperity for our community and employs more than 1,000. This week, I visited the Lab to meet with its leadership. I received an update on its research and reiterated my strong support for the Lab and its workforce. The Lab is on the cutting-edge of technological advancements in a range of fields vitally important to our national security. Every dollar of funding Rome Lab receives is an investment in our country's security and our region's future. 
 

Contact my offices for help with a federal agency

One of the most important responsibilities I have as your representative in Congress is to ensure you get the help you need when dealing with a federal agency. If you are experiencing any difficulties or have questions regarding eligibility for COVID-related benefits, I encourage you to contact any one of my three offices, which are open for business and ready to serve you.

2/27/21 13:12,The American Rescue Plan,"
 
￼

 Dear Friend,  
Today, I voted to pass the American Rescue Plan, a comprehensive COVID-19 relief package that will help control the virus, ramp up the distribution of vaccines in every community, safely reopen schools, put money into Marylanders' pockets, support small businesses and provide vital economic aid to state and local governments across our state so that Maryland communities can maintain vital services and keep residents safe.  
This robust new round of COVID-19 relief will help us get to the other side of the ongoing public health crisis.  
Key provisions of the American Rescue Plan include:  
	•	Accelerating vaccine distribution for all Americans, expanding testing capacity, improving contact tracing, enhancing treatment and controlling the virus. This includes creating a national vaccination program to speed up the equitable distribution of vaccines, partnering with state and local governments to set up community vaccination centers, funding COVID-19 testing and contract tracing programs, increasing stockpiles of personal protective equipment and other medical supplies, investing in high-quality treatments and addressing health care disparities.  
	•	Helping schools reopen safely. This includes funding for K-12 schools and higher education institutions to help mitigate costs related to the pandemic and keep students, teachers and school workers safe.  
	•	Sending direct payments to American families. This includes $1,400 for individuals, $2,800 for couples, and an additional $1,400 for every child or dependent. Direct payments will phase out for individuals earning more than $75,000 and for couples earning more than $150,000.  
	•	Supporting state and local governments. This includes dedicated funding for state, local, tribal and territorial governments to help pay for COVID-19 emergency costs, compensate first responders, public health personnel, transit workers, teachers and other essential frontline workers and deliver critical community services for the American people.  
	•	Extending and expanding unemployment benefits. This includes increasing federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation to $400 per week, up from $300 per week, and continuing jobless benefits through August 2021.  
	•	Extending another lifeline to small businesses. This includes increasing resources for small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program and the Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, and helping small businesses stay open, keep employees on the payroll and continue playing a vital role in American communities.  
	•	Strengthening and expanding federal nutrition programs to address the current hunger crisis. This includes extending increased monthly Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits through September 2021 and boosting support for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC).  
	•	Delivering housing and rental assistance. This includes extending the eviction and foreclosure moratoriums through September 2021 and providing rental assistance for struggling families across the country.  
	•	Assisting child care providers and helping parents get back to work. This includes grant funding for child care providers to cover payroll, rent and personal protective equipment costs, among other needs. It also helps provide child care for low-income families.  
	•	Strengthening America's health care system. This includes expanding access to affordable health insurance - especially for unemployed and low-income Americans - through COBRA, the Affordable Care Act marketplaces and Medicaid. It also includes robust funding for Community Health Centers, tribal health programs and state, local and territorial health departments to help expand the delivery of health care to every community across the country.  
	•	Aiding America's veterans. This includes critical resources to help the VA meet the health and economic needs of our nation's veterans, including funds to waive copays for treatment and to reduce the backlog of veterans' claims and appeals caused by the pandemic.  
	•	Providing emergency transportation relief. This includes targeted funding for public transportation systems, transit agencies and airports, along with rail funding for Amtrak and support for the aviation manufacturing and airline workforce.  
During this tremendously challenging time, I will continue to work closely with my colleagues in Congress to build a stronger and more equitable country as we recover from this tragic pandemic.
As always, my office is available to help you and your families access important federal services and benefits, like Social Security and Medicare. If you need assistance, please send me an email or call (410) 832-8890 during normal business hours.  
Sincerely,  ￼ John P. Sarbanes Maryland's Third Congressional District

2/27/21 13:38,Vermonters: I'm Fighting for You,"￼
What I'm Fighting for in Washington D.C.
A Livable Wage
  
The American people need a raise NOW. Which is why last month I once again introduced legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour. This is not a radical idea. 60 percent of the American people support raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. 
￼
  
I fought very hard to get this much needed raise for millions of Americans workers — including around 66,000 right here in Vermont — into the budget reconciliation process. Unfortunately, the Senate Parliamentarian ruled on Thursday night that raising the minimum wage does not have a substantial impact on the federal budget, thus it does not comply with the Byrd Rule and cannot be passed through the reconciliation process. I strongly disagree with this decision, but the fight continues.  
I will be working with my colleagues in the Senate to move forward with an amendment to take deductions away from large, profitable corporations that don’t pay workers at least $15 an hour and to provide small businesses with the incentives they need to raise wages. Taxpayers should not be subsidizing the starvation wages of profitable corporations. On Thursday I held a Budget Committee hearing on this very issue — you can watch the hearing here. 
Hear Vermonters speak of their support for a $15 minimum wage by clicking the video above — you can also find it here. 
The time for talk is over. We must raise the minimum wage to a livable wage and ensure our working class can live with dignity.  
 
$2,000 Federal Stimulus Checks
  
It's very simple: we must keep our promise to the American people and provide $2,000 direct payments in the next federal relief package.  
￼
  
Throughout this health and economic crisis, I’ve heard from thousands of Vermonters who have been unable to pay their rent, mortgage, electric bill or put food on the table. While the federal payments have not been nearly enough, they have provided real help to families in need, which is why I strongly oppose lowering the income eligibility for the next round of direct payments. It would be absurd to deny this relief to millions of Americans who relied on the first two checks to make ends meet. Know that as the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I am working hard to provide the bold emergency relief that working families in Vermont and all across our country need right now. And that means: $2,000 stimulus payments — no decrease to the income eligibility levels.
Watch the video above on my opposition to the income cap proposal — you can also find it here. Read an article on the proposal here. 
 
Reducing Prescription Drug Prices
  
The American people pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for the prescription medications they need. A Congressional Budget Office report released last week found that the Medicare Part D program pays far more than any other federal health program for prescription drugs.
￼
  
On average Medicare pays nearly three times more than Medicaid and about twice as much as the VA for the exact same brand-name drugs. That is outrageous and unacceptable. It’s long past time that Congress take on the greed of the pharmaceutical industry. Congress must require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies. In doing so, the 40 million Americans who get their prescription drug coverage from Medicare Part D would see substantially reduced drug prices.
Read my full response on the report’s release here and find the CBO report here. Learn about my legislation to lower drug prices here. 
 
Reliable Mail Delivery
  
I joined 33 of my Senate colleagues in demanding answers from Postmaster General Louis DeJoy.  
￼
In the past few months I’ve heard from over 4,000 Vermonters about the harm caused by delayed mail. Many, especially our neighbors in rural areas, depend on the timely delivery of the mail for prescription medications, bill payments, packages, and other essential needs. I know our US Postal employees in Vermont are doing their very best, but need support from USPS leadership. At a time when people are more isolated than ever, we must ensure the U.S. Postal Service is taking every step it can to fulfill its mission of reliable mail delivery. Read the full letter we sent to Postmaster General DeJoy here. 
DeJoy testified before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform on Wednesday on mail delays, operations and plans for the USPS — you can watch the hearing here. 
 
The Vermont Lake Monsters
  
I fought for Vermont to have its own professional baseball team over 30 years ago. As mayor of Burlington I created a task force to attract a double A team, and worked to develop an agreement with the University of Vermont to use Centennial field for baseball games. Since 1983, minor league teams based in Burlington have contributed significantly to our economy.
The decision to eliminate 39 Minor League teams, including the Vermont Lake Monsters will hurt the players, fans, workers, and communities throughout our country. I will do everything I can to encourage Major League Baseball to reverse this disastrous decision.  Find my full statement here, as well as articles on the MLB decision here and here. 
￼
  
 
  
To my fellow Vermonters: I hear you and I am fighting for you. Right now, as we go through the federal budget process and negotiate the next major COVID relief package, we have a real opportunity to pass legislation that will help working families in Vermont and all across our country.

Dear friend,

It has been another busy week in Washington as we continue to work to pass the American Rescue Plan which will return our students safely to the classroom, get vaccines out to the people, put dollars in families’ pockets and put people back to work. 

On Tuesday, I reintroduced four bills to ensure that future Presidents of the United States cannot perpetrate some of the same corrupt acts that President Donald Trump committed. The bills would require candidates, campaigns, and companies to report foreign interference in U.S. elections; enhance protections for whistleblowers who come forward to expose official wrongdoing; and make it a criminal offense for the President, Vice President, or their families to enrich themselves from foreign sources. You can read more about them here.  


 

The House also passed the Equality Act 224-206 this week. No one should be discriminated against for who they love or how they identify. I was proud to vote yes on this critical legislation and look forward to it’s swift passage in the Senate. 
 

Today, I reintroduced the No Guns for Abusers Act to protect victims of domestic violence. The pandemic has brought on stay-at-home orders nationwide, increasing the risk of intimate partner violence. Never has it been more important to take action to prevent guns from remaining in the hands of domestic abusers. 

Finally, I wanted to make sure you were aware of the changes made to the Paycheck Protection Program and how they might affect you. For two weeks, there will be a PPP exclusivity period for businesses with fewer than 20 employees. This means lenders will prioritize the PPP loan applications of businesses and nonprofits with fewer than 20 employees, and sole proprietors. Because there is a limited amount of funding available, businesses should apply as soon as possible.

The Biden Administration also announced several other changes to the program, including:
	•	Revising the PPP loan calculation formula for sole proprietors, independent contractors, and self-employed individuals and establishing a $1 billion set-aside for these businesses located in low- and moderate-income areas;
	•	Supporting formerly incarcerated entrepreneurs by making most individuals with felony convictions eligible for PPP;
	•	Making individuals with federal student loan delinquencies or defaults within the last seven years eligible for PPP; 
	•	Directing SBA to issue clear guidance that otherwise eligible PPP applicants cannot be denied access because they use Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers to pay their taxes.

For more information on the two-week prioritization period, check out the FAQs below or call my office at (510) 370-3322. 

My company already received a PPP loan. Can it get another one?

The SBA is allowing some first-time recipients to get a second PPP loan, but not everyone. To be eligible for a “second-draw” PPP loan a business can’t have more than 300 employees. To qualify for the second round of forgivable loans from the SBA, businesses must have spent or plan to spend all of their first loan and show they had a 25% or more drop in revenue in 2020 compared to 2019. (This calculation does not include loan forgiveness).

How much funding am I eligible for?

If your company is receiving a PPP loan for the first time, you can receive up to $10 million. Second-draw loans are capped at $2 million. In both cases the amount of funding you receive is based on your payroll for the previous year.

What kinds of expenses can a PPP loan cover under the new rules?
While the program was initially limited to payroll expenses, the new PPP funding can also be spent on a range of new expenses including operations expenditures, property damage costs, supplier costs, and worker protection expenditures. (For more on what PPP loans can cover, check out page 48 of this document). 

When does the 14-day exclusion period end? 
The exclusivity period will run from February 24 to March 10, 2021. If you are eligible, make sure to work with a local PPP lender on filling and submitting a loan application soon.

How do I apply? 
The Small Business Administration’s website has more information on finding a lender near you and identifying which loan you are eligible for.  

Please feel free to contact my office for assistance. You can reach me on Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram. My DM’s are open!  

Enjoy your weekend and stay safe.

Sincerely,
 

Eric Swalwell

A SOBERING MILESTONE AND RELIEF ON THE HORIZON
Dear friend, 
This weekend marks a year since the first known COVID-19 death in the U.S. was announced in our community. My heart breaks when I reflect on all that we have lost this year—over 500,000 lives with families, stories, and potential. 
We cannot go back in time, but we can act urgently to save lives and support Americans who are struggling during this economic and public health crisis. The first step is successfully passing the American Rescue Plan, which is estimated to speed up our national recovery by a year. 
Last night, I voted to pass this relief package, which now moves over to the Senate. With enhanced federal unemployment benefits set to expire on March 14, I urge my colleagues to act swiftly to avoid causing undue suffering for those who are relying on federal relief programs to get by. We were sent to Washington on the promise of delivering more relief and that’s what we need to do. 
The bill includes:
	•	A one-year expansion of the Child Tax Credit, legislation I introduced to help rebuild our middle class. The expansion will provide qualifying families with regular payments and make the benefit fully available to lower-income families. I will continue to fight for a permanent expansion of the credit, which is estimated to cut child poverty nearly in half.
	•	An additional $1,400 in direct assistance for qualifying Americans, bringing the total to $2,000 per person with what we approved in December.
	•	A national vaccination strategy and $160 billion to get shots out faster and improve testing.
	•	An increase in enhanced federal unemployment assistance to $400 per week and extension through August.
	•	$130 billion to help safely reopen our schools.
	•	Expanded small business lending programs like PPP.  
You can find out more about the plan here. 
As always, I am here to help you. If you need assistance at this difficult time, please do not hesitate to contact my Kirkland office at (425) 485-0085. For more updates on what I’m doing for WA-01, you can follow me on social media at the links above.
Stay safe and stay healthy,

Dear Friends, 
 
I've been focused on providing Oregonians relief in a time when so many are worried about staying healthy, keeping their job, and paying the bills. Yesterday, we took a step forward in that effort when the House approved President Biden’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan to provide urgently needed relief.   Included in the package is my restaurant relief proposal to provide $25 billion in grants to local restaurants and their workers, the industry hit hardest by the pandemic.   Nearly a year ago, I began working with the Oregon restaurant community who provided key leadership in what would become a national movement to save our beloved local restaurants, cafes, and bars. Already, one in six restaurants have closed their doors for good since the start of the pandemic. Without targeted aid, there will be more restaurants closed and millions more jobs lost.    It is clear that restaurants need federal relief now in the form of grants, not loans, to protect the jobs, supply chains, and local economies they support. That is why even when our proposal was blocked by Mitch McConnell, we refused to give up. We knew this grant program was the best opportunity to save our restaurants and support their workers.   While more needs to be done to help this struggling industry, our local restaurants and their workers will soon finally have a lifeline to get them through this public health crisis.   Passage of my restaurant relief proposal could very well be the difference between survival for some of our most cherished local restaurants and losing them forever.   We will get through this crisis, as we have the many that came before this. As we embark on the road to recovery and hopefully returning to normal later this year, I will continue to fight for the needs of Oregonians every step of the way. 
  
Courage,

Dear Friend,

Washington Democrats are charging full speed ahead on a hastily-crafted, nearly $2 trillion bailout package. Simply put: this is the wrong plan, at the wrong time, and for all the wrong reasons.

The goal wasn’t to put shots in people’s arms, nor was it to offer relief to working class Americans. Instead, their goal was to bail out their friends and special interest allies...KEEP READING HERE

WHAT'S GREAT IN THE 8TH 

￼

The state of Missouri has created a website so that residents can more easily register and schedule their COVID-19 vaccinations. Please consult CDC.gov/coronavirus for eligibility requirements and check HERE to begin the registration process.

￼

Construction is underway at the Southeast Behavioral Hospital in Cape Girardeau, a facility that will offer extensive impatient and outpatient psychiatric services for adults and children alike. Southern Missouri deserves nothing less than a state of the art medical facility such as this.

￼

Fredericktown Elementary School students and staff celebrated the 100th day of school this week. In honor of the special occasion some students pinned 100 items to their clothes, some dressed up as if they were 100 years old, and they spent the day participating in STEM activities centered around the number 100. I am glad to see our Southern Missouri students learning and having fun in our classrooms.

￼

February 20-27, 2021 is National FFA Week in Missouri, an organization near and dear to my heart. My life certainly wouldn’t be the same had I never joined FFA. Students can exhibit or judge livestock, learn to manage soil and grasslands, and participate in one of the many contest teams. While they’re pursuing their individual interests, students learn teamwork, communication skills, and become more developed leaders.

￼

The Congressional Art Competition is back! Now entering its 38th year, each Member of Congress gets to display work from a local artist in the U.S. Capitol for one year. The deadline to submit is March 15th. Call our Farmington (573-756-9755) or West Plains office (417-255-1515) for more details.



 IN CASE YOU MISSED IT

￼

The Democrat leadership's goal with this bill is to satisfy a political agenda and bail out their special interest allies. It is the wrong plan, at the wrong time, for all the wrong reasons. Read my Fox News Op-Ed HERE.

￼
 
I had the opportunity to join Larry Kudlow on Fox Business to talk about the Democrats' blue-state bailout and why it is time to get our kids back to school, our workforce back in action, and our cities opened up. The economy is recovering and our COVID-19 rates are plummeting. Enough is enough. Let's open up America.

￼

Cheddar invited me on their show this week to share my frustration with this $1.9 trillion bailout. I voted twice to get stimulus checks in the hands of hurting Americans, but I can't stand by quietly when only 9% of this bill is used to crush COVID.

￼

I joined Fox Business' show The Evening Edit to discuss Biden's bailout bill, which would spend $510 billion on bailing out state and local governments by rewarding officials who perpetuate painful and unnecessary lockdowns in their communities. Instead of policies that destroy jobs and harm working-class Americans, we should focus on targeted relief that allows working class Americans to reclaim their lives and livlihoods. Thank you, David Asman, for the discussion.

2/27/21 17:38,APPROVED: Details on the COVID Relief Package,"￼ 
￼  ￼  ￼  ￼  ￼  ￼  
Dear Neighbor,
The House of Representatives has approved a bold $1.9 trillion COVID disaster relief package to help struggling families, businesses and communities get back on their feet, and to fight the pandemic through increased testing and vaccine deployment.
 
WATCH MY REMARKS ON THE HOUSE FLOOR
￼
CLICK HERE TO SEE A DETAILED SUMMARY OF THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN 
Below are several highlights of the package:
Providing Critical Relief to Families
With loved ones lost and people out of work, the greatest burden of the COVID-19 pandemic has fallen on American families. To help, the relief package provides Americans with direct payments of $1,400, increases the Child Tax Credit to $3,000, expands pandemic unemployment insurance, extends paid family & medical leave, and provides food & heating assistance to those in need.
￼
Supporting Small Businesses & Workers
The American Rescue Plan protects jobs and businesses, providing $50 billion in small business relief, including $25 billion to help struggling restaurants, $1.25 billion for Shuttered Venue Grants, $15 billion for Economic Injury Disaster Loans (EIDL) and $7.25 billion for an expanded Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The package also establishes a pilot program to increase education and outreach detailing the COVID relief available to small businesses. 
￼
Helping Communities
The American Rescue Plan delivers $350 billion to communities including an estimated $792 million for Erie & Niagara Counties. Transit agencies will receive $30 billion, plus an additional $8 billion for airports, with funding directed locally to the Niagara Frontier Transpiration Authority (NFTA) to protect workers and public transportation in Western New York.  
Supporting Schools 
The package supports safe schools and continued learning for students. It allocates $130 billion for K-12 schools, providing school districts in Erie & Niagara Counties with an estimated $414 million. An additional $40 billion is dedicated to higher education, including $9.4 billion for colleges in New York, with the requirement that at least half of the funding go directly to college students.  
￼

Protecting Retirees, Seniors & Veterans
The American Rescue Plan includes the Butch Lewis Emergency Pension Plan Relief Act, stabilizing multiemployer pensions, many of which support frontline retirees who worked in the trucking, food and grocery industries. The bill directs $276 million to fight elder abuse and $13 billion for veteran healthcare. 
Fighting COVID
The only way to truly heal our economy is to heal the nation. The package provides $7.5 billion for the national vaccine distribution effort, $7.5 billion for additional FEMA vaccination sites, $49 billion toward testing, and $5.2 billion to support the further research, development and manufacturing of COVID vaccines and therapeutic treatments. 
The American Rescue Plan will now move forward for consideration and a vote in the Senate. We hope the Senate will quickly support this package and let the recovery begin.
Stay updated by visiting our website, signing up for email, or by following us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube. In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact our office if we can be of any assistance. Stay safe and be well.

Sincerely,

Hello,  I hope you and your loved ones are staying safe and well during these challenging times. Since the 117th Congress began, I have heard countless stories from across our district about the ongoing impact of COVID-19. So many Nevada families are struggling with job loss, virtual learning, and the personal toll of this pandemic, and they need help.  This week, I joined my House colleagues to pass President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, a comprehensive legislative package to help America rebuild from the devastation of the past year.  The American Rescue Plan includes nearly $4 billion for Nevada, with funding to expand vaccination efforts, safely resume in-person learning, and deliver direct payments to individuals and families. The rescue plan also includes my bill to increase and extend federal unemployment payments through August 29 to help Nevadans get back on their feet. To learn more about the American Rescue Plan, click here.  In the coming weeks, President Biden will announce a jobs and economic recovery plan to strengthen small businesses and create millions of jobs. As progress continues in Washington, I’m also working closely with local officials to make sure Nevada has the resources we need to crush the coronavirus and get our economy back on track.
￼
Several weeks ago, I had the opportunity to visit two vaccination centers in Southern Nevada alongside Clark County Commission Chair Marilyn Kirkpatrick and North Las Vegas Councilwoman Pamela Goynes-Brown. Together, we spoke with frontline workers to learn about vaccination efforts, and we discussed how Congress can help speed up vaccine distribution. Along with social distancing and masking, the COVID-19 vaccine is one of our best tools to stop the spread of the virus. To learn more about vaccine eligibility criteria or schedule your vaccination appointment, visit http://snhd.info/covid or call 1-800-401-0946.
￼
Earlier this month, I went to the Capitol to meet with Nevada National Guard troops who had been deployed to Washington after the insurrection on January 6, 2021. During the visit, I spoke with the troops about their experiences and thanked them for their work. I also had the honor to administer the oath of re-enlistment to eight members of the Guard who are continuing their patriotic service.
￼
As we continue to face down multiple crises, my priorities remain the same: crush the coronavirus, get our economy back on track, and restore faith in our democratic institutions.  Since the start of the new Congress, I’ve been proud to introduce a number of bills to help Nevada families and communities, including:
	•	The Unemployed Worker Lifeline Act, which would increase federal unemployment insurance payments by more than 30% and extend payments through the end of the summer. Unless Congress takes action now, federal unemployment payments (which are paid in addition to state unemployment) will expire in March.
	•	The Relaunching America’s Workforce Act, which would help employers prevent layoffs and support job training to help workers re-enter the workforce.
	•	The Keeping the Lights On Act, which provides federal support to small and medium-sized businesses to cover rent, mortgage payments, and essential fixed costs during the coronavirus pandemic.
	•	The U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, which would build new pathways to citizenship for undocumented Americans, protect immigrant families from exploitation and abuse, prioritize smarter border security, and address the root causes of migration.
	•	The Hospitality and Commerce Job Recovery Act, which would which would provide economic relief and recovery assistance to Southern Nevada's critical convention, trade show, entertainment, travel, and hospitality industries and their workers.
	•	The Growing Renewable Energy and Efficiency Now Act (GREEN Act), which would fight climate change by promoting clean energy tech and zero-emission vehicles.
	•	The Black Maternal Health Momnibus Act, which would improve healthcare for mothers and children and help prevent deaths from childbirth, especially for women of color.
	•	The Equality Act, which would extend anti-discrimination protections to LGBTQ+ Americans.
I hope that you will reach out to share your thoughts, opinions, concerns, or questions. You can reach my office at (702) 963-9360 or stay in touch by following me on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.  Thank you,
￼

￼
Congressman Griffith's Weekly E-Newsletter 2.28.21
Sunday, February 28, 2021 – 
Could We Have a Vaccine Surplus?
The headline on February 27 was a story that seems to be both old news and extraordinary: the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for emergency use a COVID-19 vaccine produced by Johnson & Johnson after finding it to be safe and effective.
It could be considered old news because Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine is the third COVID-19 vaccine to be authorized since December 2020, following those from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.
Nevertheless, the successful creation of these vaccines, with possibly more on the way, remains a remarkable accomplishment. A U.S. Government Accountability Office report found that vaccines typically result from a process that takes ten years from the exploratory stage to large-scale manufacturing and FDA review and licensure.
In contrast, the FDA approved the first two COVID-19 vaccines only eleven months after our country recorded its first case of the coronavirus. Each vaccine dose today being administered to Americans represents a great scientific and logistical accomplishment.
As of February 26, more than 68 million doses have been administered, resulting in 13.9 percent of the total U.S. population receiving at least one dose. The United States is well ahead of President Biden’s goal of administering one million doses a day for the first one hundred days of his presidency. In fact, the country had already met that goal on at least three days before he took office.
The Trump Administration’s Operation Warp Speed, which brought together government, the private sector, and the scientific community to achieve the unprecedented feat of creating a coronavirus vaccine within a year, supported the manufacture of promising vaccines before they met with final FDA approval. As a result, as soon as the FDA signed off on a candidate, doses of it were available for distribution. Pfizer began shipping its vaccine within 24 hours of the FDA’s approval.
Operation Warp Speed offered a head start, but manufacturers now are focused on increasing capacity to keep up with demand. Vaccinating the entire eligible population of Americans, currently estimated at 260 million people, presents a great challenge. The eligible population is less than our total population because no vaccine is currently authorized for children or pregnant mothers. Also, there are people who do not want to be vaccinated, and that is their right.
During a recent Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations hearing, we heard testimony from representatives of the companies developing vaccines that have been approved or are promising candidates. In addition to Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca may be approved in March or early April, and Novavax currently has a vaccine candidate far advanced into clinical trials.
I came away from the hearing with optimism that they would meet that challenge.
Pfizer is on track to deliver all 300 million doses that it has been contracted to deliver by Operation Warp Speed by the end of July. So is Moderna. Both of these vaccines require two doses, so that means 150 million people would be covered by each of these manufacturers.
At the time of the hearing, Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine had not yet received emergency use authorization, but it nevertheless is set to deliver 100 million doses by the end of June. This vaccine only requires one shot.
Taking these three vaccine manufacturers together, enough doses have been pledged by the end of July to cover 400 million people, well over the 260 million Americans eligible for vaccination.
When I asked the panel of witnesses whether this meant the United States would have a vaccine surplus in the summer, all five agreed that it was plausible.
With a vaccine surplus after eligible Americans are vaccinated, the remainder could be distributed for use in other countries.
That will not be the end of the work. Mutations of the coronavirus threaten to prolong the pandemic, as the current vaccines may not provide as much effective protection against them. Fortunately, both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines apparently do defend individuals against emerging variants, but the companies are nevertheless studying the possibility of booster shots to maintain their efficacy.
Children are not currently eligible to receive these vaccines, so pediatric trials are under way to see whether a separate vaccine for children would be necessary.
Vaccines offer the best path to a restoration of normalcy in our lives. I appreciated the update from the vaccine manufacturers and was encouraged by their reports of progress in our effort against the coronavirus. I am hopeful that better days are on the way. Too many vaccine doses is a problem I would like to have.

WASHINGTON D.C. - Here's what's happening...
 
 
Democrats Push Forward with Job-Killing Land Grab
 
￼
 
Gosar Opposes Democrats Jobs Killing Land Grab:
This week, Speaker Pelosi rushed a vote on the falsely-named Grand Canyon Preservation Act, legislation that does nothing to protect the Grand Canyon, rather it is an attack on Northern Arizona mining and the hard-working people of our district. Sadly, Speaker Pelosi and her liberal allies refused to hold a single hearing for meaningful consideration or debate of this legislation. In doing so, Democrats foisted a massive land grab of more than one million acres and permanently banned mining and other multiple-use activities in our great state of Arizona. 
 
It is estimated that this harmful bill will destroy as many as 4,000 jobs and cost $29 billion in sacrificed economic activity. The withdrawal area also contains 4,204 acres belonging to the Arizona State Land Department for the benefit of Arizona’s school children. This will mean hundreds of millions of dollars in lost revenues for local communities and for our schools.
 
This bill would also prevent the ability to mine high-grade uranium, a critical element for carbon-free renewable energy that has irreplaceable application in defense in mining.  Today, the United States imports 97% of uranium from foreign sources, including Russia. If we pass bills like the Grand Canyon Preservation Act, we will forever close this area and soon 100% of our uranium will be supplied by foreign nations. At the same time, our ability to provide for the defense or our nation and support other necessary industries will be comprised because of this bill.
 
That’s why I voted no.

Airstrikes in Syria
 
￼
 
Gosar Condemns Airstrikes in Syria:
When he was a candidate, Biden had this to say about the use of force: “A President should never take this nation to war without the informed consent of the American people.” Sadly, his comments did not age well. Congress has not passed an authorization for the use of military force in Syria. Worse, Congress was not briefed in advance of this air strike that killed at least 22 people. I’m eager to hear the legal rationale for why Biden acted prior to getting approval from Congress. I strongly condemn these actions. It is time for all our troops to return home from Syria and America should not further wade into that country’s long simmering civil war. 
 
 
 
Gosar Taking a ""Bite"" Out of Student Loans
 
￼
 
The Dental Loan Repayment Assistance Act:
Coinciding with February being National Children’s Dental Health Month, this week I joined a bipartisan group of House and Senate colleagues to reintroduce the Dental Loan Repayment Assistance Act. 
 
As a dentist, I fully appreciate and understand that training our next generation of dentists is critical to the overall health of our country. Unfortunately, a critical factor in recruiting and retaining qualified dental school faculty from recent dental school or residency program graduates is the staggering student loan debt and income disparity with private practice. This is especially acute in pediatric dentistry. 
 
I’m proud to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reintroduce this important legislation that aims to remove recruiting barriers while strengthening oral health training. Specifically, the legislation would alleviate the taxation burden by exempting for five years dental faculty members from paying those exorbitant taxes on their federal loan repayment benefits.

District Highlight

A local, hot topic driving discussions this week in Pinal County is the concerning matter that many of our campsites enjoyed by campers have been overtaken by homeless populations, drug users and individuals utilizing the sites without sufficient living and bathing standards or utilities.  This creates an unhealthy campground and surrounding. I have been outspoken about my concerns regarding these cherished campsites. I was happy to learn that Bureau of Land Management Field Director, Leon Thomas held a public meeting to present proposals that would address these concerns and to begin the clean-up the campgrounds. This is welcomed news for our community.
 
 
 
Other Highlights from This Week
 
This week I wrote an Op Ed for Revolver News: ""A State of Chaos: Biden's Rule by Authoritarian Decree."" I will continue to speak out and oppose America Last policies that support criminals over citizens, gangs over families and drug dealers over neighborhoods.
 
Also this week, my Republican colleagues and I petitioned Chairwoman Maloney to hold a hearing on the need to reopen our schools. Not only is the White House refusing to follow the science when it comes to reopening schools, but House Democrats admit that the COVID-19 legislation they pushed this week does not help get students back into the classroom since 95% of the money allocated for K-12 education won't be spent until after 2021.

THIS WEEK ON BUDDY'S BRIEFING

This week, House Democrats passed the $1.9 trillion Biden Bailout Bill. This package is the wrong plan, at the wrong time, for the wrong reasons.

It is the wrong plan because it will incentivize lockdowns that have harmed our workers and children for too long.

It is the wrong time because our economy is improving, and we have yet to spend $1 trillion of previously approved funding. In fact, just this week it was reported that jobless claims dropped dramatically.

Worst of all, less than 9 percent of the $2 trillion bill directly goes to combating COVID-19. The remainder goes to a partisan wish list of priorities. 

Congress must address the pandemic, but this is certainly not the way to do it. 

We discuss this and more in this episode of Buddy's Briefing.

INCREASING ACCESS TO TELEHEALTH FOR SENIORS

This week I introduced the Telehealth Modernization Act to increase access to telehealth for seniors. 

Telehealth has been a vital tool during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for vulnerable Medicare patients. As vaccines are administered and we become closer to combating this virus, one thing that should remain is the unprecedented access to the use of telehealth that was created during the pandemic. 

My legislation permanently removes Medicare's geographic and originating site restrictions which require a patient to live in a rural area and be physically in a doctor's office or clinic to use telehealth services. The Telehealth Modernization Act permanently ends these restrictions to allow patients to use telehealth services no matter where they are. 

FROM OUR NATION'S CAPITOL CCCI

Monday, February 22, 2021:  I spent this past weekend in Salt Lake City, UT, attending a conservative climate conference where we heard from a number of scientists as well as stakeholders.  Among those we heard from were representatives from The Conservation Coalition, Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the Bureau of Energy Resources.  The discussion revolved around the science of climate change and the future for conservatives in climate.  After our all-staff conference call this morning, I meet with my good friend and one of our many fine business leaders in the First District, Kevin Jackson, before heading to our Savannah District office where, along with my Congressional colleagues Rep. Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-DE) and Rep. Barbara Lee (D-CA), I have a conference call with National Institutes of Health (NIH) Director Francis Collins and members of his staff to discuss the lack of racial data for vaccinations and the lack of trust minority communities have with the vaccine.  After a great discussion with Dr. Collins and staff, I have a phone interview with NPR to talk about changes to mail-in ballot and voter ID laws in Georgia.  Next, I have a Budget Committee markup on the $1.9 trillion Biden Bailout Bill or American Rescue Plan as the Democrats refer to it as.  In the spirit of bipartisanship, we Republicans offer numerous amendments to the bill and, not surprisingly, none are accepted by the Democratic majority.  A link to amendments that I offer during the committee meeting can be found here.  Once the hearing is concluded and the bill is rammed through the committee, I have a Doctors Caucus conference call where we discuss health care amendments that we will be offering once the Biden Bailout Bill is debated in the Rules Committee later this week.

Tuesday, February 23, 2021:  I begin the day with a virtual call with ONE, a global movement campaigning to end extreme poverty and preventable disease by 2030, particularly in Africa.  I have met with this group every year I have served in Congress and have always been impressed with their advocacy.  Afterwards, I have a virtual call with my good friend Mary Jane Crouch, CEO of America’s Second Harvest as she brings me up to date on their legislative priorities.  Next, I join in on an Energy and Commerce (E&C) Oversight and Investigations (O&I) Subcommittee hearing on expanding availability of the COVID-19 vaccine.  Although I am not a member of this particular subcommittee, I am allowed to waive on and ask questions.  A link to my questions can be found here. 
￼
Members of Congress hold a moment of silence to honor the 500,000 Americans lost to COVID-19
Afterwards, I head to the airport, and once at the Capitol, I have a Whip Team conference call to discuss the agenda for this week.  Next, I head to the Capitol steps where I join leadership and Members of Congress for a moment of silence to honor the 500,000 Americans lost to COVID-19.  Afterwards, I head to the House Chamber where we have our first vote series of the day and remain there afterwards to deliver a memorial to Tommy Seipel, who passed recently.  A link to my memorial can be found here.

Wednesday, February 24, 2021:  After a GOP security briefing where we hear from the Acting Sergeant at Arms, Acting Chief of the U.S. Capitol Police and Commanding General of the D.C. National Guard, we have our weekly GOP Conference meeting.  Next, I head to the House Chamber where I deliver tributes to the National Museum of the Mighty Eighth Air Force, Thiokol explosion 50th anniversary, Ware County Sheriff Randy Royal and pharmacists administering the COVID-19 vaccine.  A link to my tributes can be found here, here, here and here.  Afterwards, I head to the Cannon Rotunda where I have a live interview on Fox Business to discuss the COVID-19 vaccine rollout and the Biden Bailout. 
￼
Rep. Carter appears on Fox Business
A link to my interview can be found here.  Next, I head back to the House Chamber for our first vote series of the day before returning to my office and joining in on a virtual E&C Communications and Technology Subcommittee hearing on disinformation and extremism in the media.  A link to my questions can be found here.  Afterwards, I have a meeting with representatives from Waffle House who are in town visiting before joining in on a virtual call with representatives from the Association of Accessible Medicines.  Next, I head back to the House Chamber for our second vote series of the day before heading to an E&C Republican member retreat off of Capitol Hill. 

Thursday, February 25, 2021:  My day starts early as I have a Doctors Caucus meeting where we discuss our budget amendments we are offering to the Rules Committee tomorrow.  We also meet with leadership to discuss how we can assist them in crafting health care legislation.  Afterwards, I head to the House Chamber where I deliver tributes to former Bryan County Sheriff Clyde Smith, Will Ingram, the City of Richmond Hill and Betty Miner.  A link to my tributes can be found here, here, here and here. 
￼
Rep. Carter speaks on the House Floor
Next, I have a phone interview with NBC News to discuss pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and independent retail pharmacies before heading back off of Capitol Hill where I spend most of the afternoon in our E&C Republican member retreat.  Once back on Capitol Hill, I have a phone interview with Inside Health Policy to discuss PBMs and independent retail pharmacies before heading to the House Chamber for our first vote series of the day.  Once back in my office I have a virtual call with Savannah constituents of the Garden Club of America. 

Friday, February 26, 2021:  I begin today by attending a Rules Committee parliamentary bootcamp session to learn more about the intricacies of the parliamentary rules governing the House.  Afterwards, I head to the Budget Committee hearing room in the Cannon House Office Building where I record this week’s edition of Buddy’s Briefing before heading to the House Chamber for our first vote series of the day that includes 5 votes and lasts over 4 hours. 
￼
Rep. Carter filming Buddy's Briefing
After heading back to my office where I finally catch up on some work, I join in virtually on the Rules Committee meeting where they are considering the $1.9 trillion Biden Bailout Bill.  During the debate, I offer three amendments to the committee for their consideration.  A link to my presentation can be found here.  After the Rules Committee rejects all amendments offered by Republicans, they send the package to the House floor where it is debated.  Around 10:00 p.m. I head to the House Chamber where we vote on the rule and then debate passage of the bill.  During the debate I speak against passage of the bill. 
￼
Rep. Carter speaks against the Biden Bailout Bill
A link to my comments can be found here.  Our final vote is held at 1:00 a.m. Saturday morning and the $1.9 trillion Biden Bailout Bill is passed along partisan lines without a single Republican vote.

2/28/21 10:26,"A Partisan Package, Vaccination Update and Other Helpful Information","
 
 
 

February 28, 2021
 

Dear Neighbor, 
 
I believe the long-term success of our country is dependent on our willingness to work together as one team for the greater good. I have been named Florida’s most bipartisan legislator and I will continue to work across the aisle to get things done for my constituents and our community. While I remain committed to bipartisanship, Democrats have proven again last week that they are not. 

The past year has been very challenging for our nation and for many of our neighbors. We have previously provided five bipartisan relief packages to help small businesses and individuals who are hurting.  There is still $1 trillion in unspent federal funding from those packages. Wanting transparency and accountability for how your tax dollars are spent should not be a partisan issue. Relief should be temporary, targeted and tied to COVID. We should not be using the suffering of Americans to play politics. 
 

Last week, the Speaker crammed through items that have nothing to do with the pandemic. For example, she wants to use this process to pass a $15 per hour federal minimum wage, even though the Congressional Budget Office has said that doing so will actually result in the loss of jobs for 1.4 million Americans. 
 

In total, the package includes nearly $2 trillion in spending. Supposedly this funding is needed to respond to the immediate threat of today’s COVID-19 pandemic. However, after excluding stimulus payments to individuals, almost half of the bill’s funding is not slated to be spent until Fiscal Year (FY) 2022 or even later. So, the only urgency is the partisan push to pass the package—not to get the majority of relief to Americans who are hurting- which I have a problem with. For example: 

	•	Of the $39 billion allocated for childcare, only 19% ($8 billion) would be spent this fiscal year.
	•	Of the $5 billion proposed for Emergency Housing Vouchers, only 5% ($250 million) would be spent this fiscal year. Additionally, none of the $5 billion included for Homeless Assistance would be spent this fiscal year.
	•	Of the $50 billion set aside for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, only 23% ($11 billion) would be spent this fiscal year.
	•	 Of the entire Education & Labor Committee funding of the package, only 12% ($35 billion) would be spent this fiscal year. Additionally, schools remain shuttered throughout much of the country. This plan doesn’t even require schools to reopen despite guidance from CDC officials who say it is safe to reopen and calls from Dr. Fauci saying that the benefits of re-opening schools far outweigh the potential risks. 

Also, less than 9% of the $1.9 trillion in proposed spending will go to combatting the virus through public health measures such as vaccination and more testing. Defeating the virus should be our primary objective- not using the crisis to pass a partisan wish list.  
 

Other concerns I had with the package include the fact that it:

	•	Includes $350 billion in taxpayer bailouts to states for non-COVID related budget failures
	•	Expands COVID relief benefits to illegal immigrants
	•	Provides federal bureaucrats up to 15 weeks of paid leave if they have school-age children attending school remotely
	•	Allocates $112 million for the transit system in Speaker Pelosi’s district, and 
	•	Allows large businesses to participate in the PPP program which will further crowd out small business applications and participation


I remain committed to bipartisan efforts to increase the production and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine- a step doctors agree is necessary to getting back to normal. For all these reasons, I voted against the pandemic relief package last week. It is bad public policy and wrong for our country. 

﻿Continue reading for important information.  
 

Vaccinating Seniors, Vulnerable Populations and Essential Workers

During last week’s Oversight and Investigation Subcommittee Hearing, there was an important discussion about vaccine production. Here are a few key facts noted during the hearing: 

	•	As of last week, the CDC reports that 72.4 million doses have been delivered and more than 56.2 million of those have been administered. This is just eleven months after the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in the U.S. –a truly remarkable feat and a testament to the hard work of the scientists and doctors who have worked on this project as part of Operation Warp Speed.

	•	Limited supply is a barrier for getting everyone who wants one a vaccine, however, progress continues to be made.

	•	Pfizer projects it will supply 120 million doses to the U.S. by the end of March—20 million more than initially promised.

	•	Moderna expects 100 million doses two months earlier than expected.

	•	Based on current projections—by the end of July—we’ll have enough to vaccinate 300 million people, well more than the estimated 260 million currently eligible. And—we have more vaccines on the horizon.

	•	Johnson & Johnson’s single dose vaccine received approval for Emergency Use Authorization, which will significantly increase vaccine supply. 
 
Ensuring everyone who wants a vaccine can get one is the most important step we can take in restoring our way of life. More than 2.8 million Floridians have already been vaccinated, but I know many more are still waiting. I will continue to work in a bipartisan manner to expedite production and distribution.   

In the interim, the Governor has said that teachers and law enforcement will likely be able to get vaccinated at the upcoming state-run site in Tampa beginning March 3rd. More specific details to come as soon as they are available. Additionally, while the state continues to work on ensuring all seniors are able to be vaccinated, the Governor anticipates being able to vaccinate those under 65 within the next month. Click here to learn more. 


Where to Register by County

Pasco seniors have a few options for vaccination. They can register through the Pasco County health department’s portal. Then at 2:00 p.m. on Sundays the county releases appointment slots. Seniors can log on at exactly 2:00 p.m. and try to register for one of the slots. They are usually gone within 5 minutes. They can also pre-register for the state’s portal and reserve their space in line. The state will contact them once it is their turn for a vaccine. Additionally, seniors can register through Publix, Walmart, or Winn Dixie. I would suggest trying each approach until an appointment is secured.  

Pinellas seniors have similar options. They can register through the Pinellas County health department’s portal. County health officials are contacting those who have pre-registered as appointments become available.  They can also pre-register for the state’s portal and reserve their space in line. The state will contact them once it is their turn for a vaccine. Additionally, they can register through Publix and Walmart. 
 
Hillsborough seniors can pre-register for the state’s portal and reserve their space in line. The state will contact them once it is their turn for a vaccine. Additionally, they can register through Publix, Walmart, or Winn Dixie.  

*Note- there are no county residency requirements for any vaccine in the State of Florida, which means residents of all three counties can attempt to secure a slot through any of the options mentioned above. 
 

Remembering a Hero
 
﻿Last week, I attended the funeral service of my constituent, Deputy Michael J. Magli, who was tragically killed in the line of duty while trying to protect our community from a drunk driver. He leaves behind a loving wife and two beautiful children. My thoughts and prayers remain with this young, grieving family as they mourn. During his funeral colleagues, friends and family members spoke of his devotion to his family and his desire to help others. His death is a tragic reminder of the danger our law enforcement community faces each day as they endeavor to keep us safe. I was moved to see so many of our neighbors showing support for his family as the procession drove to his final resting place. May this fallen hero’s dedication to our community never be forgotten and may Deputy Magli’s memory be eternal.  
 
 

Fighting to Ensure Veterans Receive the Care they Deserve
 
I am a proud co-sponsor of legislation introduced last week to cover K2 Veterans’ toxic exposure care and benefits. Many of these Veterans were exposed to toxins that have led to serious and life-threatening illnesses yet they have been denied VA medical care and benefits. Our important bill, which has strong support in the House and Senate, will rectify this this injustice. 
 

I also enjoyed spending time with local Veterans at the VFW District 21 Joint Meeting last weekend. It was an honor to give a brief legislative update and to share information about the work I am doing to help our heroes. 
 

Additionally, last week I re-introduced the Major Richard Star Act. The bill is named in honor of Major Richard A. Star—a father, husband, and decorated war Veteran who, as a result of his combat-related injuries, was medically retired. Major Star sadly lost his battle with cancer on February 13, 2021. The brave men and women who return from serving our country should be able to receive all of the benefits promised to them. Military retirement pay and service-connected disability compensation are two completely different benefits. One does not diminish the merits of the other. I am committed to rectifying this injustice for all Veterans, and passage of the Major Richard Star Act will get us one step closer to our goal of ensuring that Veterans receive the benefits they have earned and deserve. 
 
 

Preventing Suicides 

﻿Since 2001, the suicide rate in the U.S. has risen by a shocking 31%, making suicide the 10th leading cause of death in the nation, with an estimated 47,000 lives lost each year. These staggering statistics make it clear that we need to do more. Improved methods for identifying and assessing the suicide risks of emergency department patients is a significant need. As part of my long-term commitment to fixing our broken mental health care system, I want to be sure that we enhance the procedures surrounding the discharge of patients who have attempted suicide or exhibit suicidal ideation to maximize the likelihood that they obtain appropriate follow-up care.  Last week, I filed a bipartisan, bicameral bill to achieve that goal. Click here to learn more. 
 
 

Facilitating Research

﻿It was an honor to speak at the recent virtual Grand Opening of Moffitt at Wesley Chapel. This 28,000-square-foot outpatient facility will bring access to Moffitt expertise and nationally ranked cancer care to patients in Pasco County. It is located in the Healing Plaza on the south side of the campus of AdventHealth Wesley Chapel. The facility has 20 exam rooms and 22 infusion chairs. Clinical trials are scheduled to begin at this location approximately six to nine months after opening, starting with phase 3 trials and eventually moving toward more complex trials, in the future. This is a truly wonderful addition to our community!  
 
 

Cutting through the Red Tape

While federal, state, and local government offices have found a way to implement COVID safeguards and safely provide essential services to the public, the Social Security Administration remains closed for in-person visits nearly one year into the pandemic. This is unacceptable. Click here to read my request of the agency.﻿ 
 

Spending time in the Community

I recently had the chance to read to children at Great Hope Preschool in New Port Richey. Not only was it an enjoyable experience, it was great to see children engaged and learning. Thank you for the invitation!  
 
 

Consumer Protection Connection
 

I hope you will be able to join me in my upcoming Virtual Consumer Protection Forum. In the meantime, please check out these practical tips that can help you from becoming a victim of identity theft.  
 
 

Community Concentration 
 
My team had the privilege of attending the recent Grand Opening of Tropical Poké Cafe in Hudson. Congratulations and best wishes to Harry and his wife on their new family-owned and operated business! 
 

My team also recently attended the Grand Opening of a local GEICO franchise in Zephyrhills. Welcome to the community! 
 
 

Constituent Corner

I recently received this message from a constituent whose son attended my Veterans' Employment Fair last week.

 
I want to thank you for the Veteran Employment fair you hosted in Oldsmar. My son Michael who is 30% disabled, an Afghanistan veteran want and got some promising leads. I’m a Vietnam veteran but it seems to be even harder for veterans from more recent wars to fit back in to society. Thanks ever so much for your care! 

This is just one example of the work we do each day. Constituent services are a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you!

Sincerely,
 

Gus Bilirakis

Dear Friend,  This week was a historic one for West Virginia!
 
I am proud to have facilitated a trade and investment Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between West Virginia and Vietnam, which was signed this week by Governor Jim Justice and Vietnam's Vice Minister of Industry and Trade. The MOU will promote cooperation on a range of issues including the exportation of coal, natural gas, education, mining equipment, and hardwoods to help propel Vietnam's fast growing economy. This will also help keep West Virginians employed, strengthen our economy, and put our world-class resources on an international stage.
 
Back in Washington, we had West Virginia's COVID-19 Czar Dr. Clay Marsh testify in the Ways and Means Health Subcommittee about how West Virginia is leading the nation in vaccinations. I am so proud of Dr. Marsh and our entire state's leadership for setting an international example of successful vaccine distribution. I thank the Ways and Means Committee for highlighting West Virginia's success. Watch my committee remarks by clicking the image below.
 
￼
 
We ended the week voting on Democrats' proposed COVID-19 ""stimulus package."" In this $1.9 trillion bill, only 9% is actually focused on helping Americans crush COVID-19. House Democrats want the rest of the funding to go toward their pet projects, like building a subway system in Nancy Pelosi's district, funding Chuck Schumer's Seaway International Bridge from New York to Canada, and potentially giving stimulus checks to illegal immigrants. This is a radical liberal wish list that Democrats are  disguising as COVID-19 relief. Americans need targeted aid that will keep small businesses open, get children back into the classroom, and get people back to work. This legislation is unacceptable, and we must do better.

#LowcountryFirst Newsletter | February 28th, 2021
 

Putting the #LowcountryFirst

Friends,

After spending time back home with constituents over the last couple of weeks, I returned to Washington and hit the ground running on several bills. I want the work I do to have a visible and valuable impact on the Lowcountry and the nation - from conservation to criminal justice reform to addressing government’s wasteful spending.
 
Just two days ago, I joined my colleagues to pass legislation to protect over 3 million acres of pristine wilderness from destructive development. I promised the Lowcountry I would defend the natural beauty we love and depend on. This bill ensures millions of acres of forests, rivers, and plains are kept whole for generations of hunters, fishermen, and nature-lovers of all kinds. 
 
This week, I also experienced a first in my time here in Congress: My first bill passed the House!
 
For decades, those in federal custody have been unable to simply write an email to their lawyer without the government reading everything they say. This is a huge violation of the Constitutional right to due process and as such impacts every single American. Texts and phone calls are protected, but not email?
 
My bill puts an end to this injustice and brings this Constitutional right into the 21st century. H.R. 546 overwhelmingly passed the House with bipartisan support. 
 
On Tuesday, I floor managed for the first time! I oversaw the passage of a bill to rename the Post Office in Georgetown after the legendary Republican Joseph Rainey. Joseph Rainey was born into slavery in 1832. In 1870, he became the first Black American to ever serve in Congress. He was a successful businessman, civil rights leader, and educator who overcame war and hatred to fight for the liberty of his fellow Americans. Rainey’s home in Georgetown still stands today. This was a tremendous recognition of his work and dedication to our state and our nation. 
 
I also promised the Lowcountry I would work to keep our communities safe.
 
In light of the Biden administration’s plans to close the Guantanamo Bay Detention Center, I introduced legislation to prevent any transfer of these prisoners to South Carolina. Moving some of the most dangerous terrorists in the world to the United States is irresponsible. Any plan to transfer these prisoners to the U.S., such as the Obama-era proposal to transfer these prisoners to the Charleston Brig, is unacceptable. These terrorists are the worst of the worst and should not be held in South Carolina. 

Watch my interview with News 2 about this bill here or below. 

 

Lastly, I voted early Saturday morning (close to 2am) against Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s stimulus bill last night. In the dead of night the House passed a partisan bill that had little to do with COVID-19 relief.  
 
Included in this spending spree was a laundry list of liberal pet projects, including:

	•	Over $100 million for an underground rail in Pelosi’s backyard
	•	$1.5 million on a bridge for Chuck Schumer in New York
	•	$86 billion in union pension bailouts
	•	$35 billion ObamaCare bailout
	•	$1.5 billion Amtrak bailout
	•	$1 billion in foreign aid
 
This is far from COVID relief. It’s politics as usual. Only one percent of this package is being spent on vaccinations for Coronavirus. Less than 10 percent of the total package goes to COVID relief. Not to mention, $1 trillion from the previous COVID packages has yet to be spent. We need to know, to the very last penny, where this money is. And we need to target any and all COVID relief to those who truly need it.

This is hard work, but it’s the kind of work I came to Congress to do.

Sincerely, 
 

Congresswoman Nancy Mace

2/28/21 11:46,Black History Month — Understanding Our History and Fighting for a Better Future,"￼
Understanding Our History and Fighting for a Better Future
  
On the last day of Black History Month, I implore each of us to continue learning. Black History IS American history. Let us commit to learning the true history of our nation, and to celebrating the contributions of Black Americans every day — every month of the year. 
As February ends, I’d like to honor the experiences of Black Vermonters and share just a few stories about the work they are doing to make Vermont a welcoming place for all. 
 
Land Access is a Social Justice Issue: The Fight to Preserve Black Farm Ownership in America
  
In 1910, Black farmers made up 14% of all farmers in the United States. Today, Black farmers account for fewer than 2% of U.S. farmers and own less than 1% of all American farmland. 
I encourage all Vermonters to learn about the history of land ownership in our country. In the video below, hear about the work being done in Vermont and the larger New England region to preserve and increase African American farm ownership and celebrate Black heritage. You can also find the video here. 
￼
This month I entered a statement into the Congressional Record — the official archive of the U.S. Congress — honoring the work of the Clemmons Family Farm, which is located in Charlotte, VT. Read the full statement here. 
￼
 
Vermont Students Demanding Justice
  
I stand with students of the South Burlington School District and all Vermonters who are demanding justice and an end to the horrors of systemic racism. Read VT Digger’s article on the raising of the Black Lives Matter flag at South Burlington Middle school here. 
￼
 
Helping Families of Color Access Food During the COVID-19 Pandemic
  
Before the pandemic, Black Americans experienced hunger at more than twice the rate of white Americans — and we know due to the COVID-19 crisis that more families than ever before are struggling to put food on the table. 
After seeing so many struggle to afford healthy food, the Susu Community Farm started a free CSA program for families of color in Windham County, VT. Learn about the program, their mission to provide safe spaces for people color, and their plans to buy farmland in the video below. You can also view the video here.  
￼
 
Ensuring ALL Our People Have Access to Vital COVID-19 Information
  
It is critically important that all Vermonters have information on coronavirus prevention, treatment, test sites, and vaccine registration. The Vermont Health Department, in partnership with the Vermont Multilingual Task Force, has created translated materials and videos so that all Vermont families remain informed of the latest public health updates. You can find the translated materials on the Health Department site here. 
I’m very glad to see that community groups are also finding creative ways to help disseminate coronavirus information. The Afro- folk jazz group, KeruBo, recently released a song to encourage Vermont’s African families to learn more about the COVID-19 vaccine. Read an interview with the group’s lead vocalist here, and watch the music video below, or here. 
￼
 
I believe if we all do the necessary work to understand our nation’s stories of achievement and progress, of joy and suffering, then together we can create a better future. 
In the year since we last celebrated Black History Month, we have experienced an unprecedented health and economic crisis that has both highlighted and worsened our country’s disparities. To state it plainly, Black Americans and communities of color have experienced immense suffering and pain over the last twelve months. Even here in Vermont, where we have responded to the pandemic better than nearly any other state in the nation, we have still seen disproportionately worse rates of COVID infection and death among Black Vermonters. As we reflect on what Black History Month means for us as a nation, we must take time to celebrate the many joyful stories and rich history of the Black community, while also acknowledging the devastating realities of systemic racism, struggle for equality and equity, and the immense amount of work before us. 
I am hopeful that if we are truly committed to creating a more just society, we will educate ourselves and actively work to create anti-racist communities every day. And that means tomorrow — when it is no longer Black History Month — the work continues. 
￼

CONGRESSWOMAN MARIA ELVIRA SALAZAR'S WEEKLY UPDATE

Happy Sunday! It was great hearing from you all at our very first Telephone Townhall Meeting about the $1.9 trillion dollar COVID-19 spending package. I genuinely enjoyed listening to all of your concerns about this proposal. 

We celebrated Black History Month with our students at Whigham Elementary School in Cutler Bay and joined my colleagues in introducing the Fairness For All Act which protects those in our LGBTQ community from discrimination while also safeguarding religious freedom, one of the cornerstones of our democracy. Our Foreign Affairs Committee colleagues also sent a letter calling on the Biden Administration to not lift sanctions on the brutal Castro Communist dictatorship in Cuba. 

I look forward to continue addressing your cases, reading your letters, and responding to your comments on Social Media. Please continue to let me know what your thoughts are and never hesitate to reach out to my office. My team is more than happy to assist you with any of your concerns and guide you through any challenges you may have with our federal agencies. 

It is truly the honor of a lifetime to fight for YOU in the halls of Congress.

WE HELD OUR VERY FIRST TELEPHONE TOWN HALL
 

It was great hearing from you all at our very first Telephone Townhall Meeting about the $1.9 trillion dollar COVID-19 spending package. I genuinely enjoyed listening to your concerns about this proposal and look forward to continue holding these Telephone Townhall Meetings to hear directly from you, my constituents, on the issues facing our community. 

With only 9% percent of the funding directly related to combatting COVID-19 and much of the aid not being spent until 2022, Speaker Pelosi decided to rush her partisan priorities rather than meeting the urgent needs of the American people. No Republican amendments were incorporated into this $1.9 trillion dollar spending package, including common-sense proposals like my own, which would have extended the time that our local job creators have to payback EIDL loans by another year! 

The only bipartisan thing about this bill was the fact that two of my Democrat colleagues crossed the aisle to reject this proposal. I am totally committed to working with my colleagues on a bipartisan bill that will put more money in the hands of our small business owners, prioritize funding for vaccine distribution, and put Americans back to work! 

I JOINED MY COLLEAGUES IN CALLLING ON PRESIDENT BIDEN TO RECOGNIZE THE CASTRO REGIME'S 
THREAT TO DEMOCRACY
 

I was proud to join my colleagues, Mark Green (TN) and August Pfluger (TX), who serve on the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, in calling on President Biden to not lift any sanctions on the brutal Castro Communist regime that continues to terrorize the people of Cuba. 

This is not the time for concessions to a brutal dictatorship that cares about nothing else other than remaining in power. I urge this Administration to stand with the brave men and women yearning for freedom within the island and reject any attempt to appease the murderous Castro regime.

WE COMMEMORATED THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF 
THE BROTHERS TO THE RESCUE SHOOTDOWN 

 

This week marked 25 years since the horrific Brothers to the Rescue massacre organized by the terrorist Castro dictatorship. 

The Castro regime must be held accountable for its crimes – specifically, Raúl Castro, who ordered this attack. In addition to Castro, the three individuals who were previously indicted by a U.S. federal court, General Rubén Martínez Puente, Lorenzo Alberto Pérez-Pérez, and Francisco Pérez-Pérez, must be brought to justice.

We will not let the world forget the horror that occurred on February 24, 1996, nor will we remain silent while some individuals attempt to gloss over the true despotic nature of the Cuban dictatorship. We remain committed to demanding justice for the regime’s victims, including Carlos, Armando, Mario, and Pablo, so long as those responsible continue to walk the earth.

WE CALLED ON THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION TO IMPLEMENT THE D.E.D. PROGRAM FOR OUR VENEZUELAN EXILE COMMUNITY 
 

I joined my friend and colleague, Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart, in sending a letter to the Secretary of Homeland Security requesting the current status of the DED for Venezuelan nationals and stressing the need for guidance and rules as soon as possible. 

The D.E.D program would provide our Venezuelan exile community with much-needed peace of mind during these unprecedented times.

Friends,
This week the US House of Representatives passed legislation I recently introduced to rename the Georgetown County Post Office after Joseph Rainey. 
Joseph Rainey was born into slavery in Georgetown, South Carolina in 1832. His father was a barber and used his earnings to buy freedom for himself and his family, including Joseph. Later, during the Civil War, Joseph was drafted by the Confederacy, but he escaped to Bermuda with his wife and started a business. In 1866 he returned to Georgetown, South Carolina where he became the county’s Republican Party Chairman. Just a few years later in 1870, he was elected to Congress where he served until 1879 making him the longest serving African American Member of Congress in the nineteenth century. Joseph Rainey fought tirelessly for civil rights, education, and economic opportunity. He has left behind a legacy that will never be forgotten.
It was a privilege to introduce this bill that honors a true American patriot like Mr. Rainey. All South Carolinians can look up to Joseph Rainey as a trailblazer who fought for opportunity for all and someone that taught us to pursue excellence. 
I also spoke about Mr. Rainey on the House Floor, which you can watch by clicking below!

Covid-19 Vaccines
 
 
A Covid-19 Vaccine Clinic for 1st Doses will be held at the Myrtle Beach Convention Center for all individuals who meet Phase 1A criteria on March 2 and March 3 at 9 a.m. – 4:30 p.m.
These events will require appointments to be made in advance, and appointments can be made online here: http://www.vaxlocator.dhec.sc.gov or by calling 1-866-365-8110.
 

 
 
Operation Desert Storm
 
 
I, along with 35 of my colleagues, am proud to cosponsor a bipartisan resolution that recognizes the sacrifices that were made by those who served, their families, and the 143  men and women who gave their lives during the operation. This is an opportunity to reflect on the many sacrifices our nation’s heroes have made to protect our rights and freedoms – sacrifices that should never be taken for granted. This resolution commemorates their courage as a symbol of our commitment to ensuring America remains the greatest country in the world.
 

 

 
 
The Biden Bailout
 
 
The American Rescue Plan is not about Covid relief. Over 90% of the bill is focused on enacting President Biden's and Speaker Pelosi's political priorities while just 9% of the bill actually includes spending related to combatting the virus. There's no question that this legislation is more about a liberal agenda than doing what's right for the nation.  You can read more about what’s in the legislation here. 
 

￼
 
 
Have a great week!

Sincerely, 
￼
 
Tom Rice

2/28/21 13:06,Dave's Weekly Wrap,"
 
 

Friends,

To date, Congress has provided more than $3.5 trillion to help Americans tackle the challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, roughly a third of which has yet to be spent.
 

Yet, at 2 A.M. yesterday morning, the House voted on a $1.9 trillion bill called the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. Instead of providing targeted, responsible relief to those who need it most, this bill funnels billions of dollars to non-COVID purposes, greenlights even more in wasteful spending, and eliminates over a million jobs. 

Only 9% of the $1.9 trillion bill goes toward combatting COVID-19 through public health initiatives such as vaccine distribution, testing and tracing. It also included funding for things completely unrelated to COVID-19, like $112 million for an underground railway in Silicon Valley and $1.5 million for the Seaway International Bridge in New York. 

The legislation also includes a 107% increase to the minimum wage. While well-intentioned, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that the increase would destroy 1.4 million jobs (500,000 more jobs than the number of workers it would help lift out of poverty). 

For all of these reasons, I voted no. I firmly believe that we should effectively and efficiently use the $1 trillion in relief from previous COVID bills that remains unspent before we approve additional spending and ask more of American taxpayers.

Any additional relief must be focused on distributing vaccines and targeted toward immediate, COVID-related needs, such as supporting our most devastated industries and the workers they employ, safely re-opening schools, and expanding broadband capabilities to meet new tele-health, employment and educational demands.

The Road to Recovery Travels Along Broadband Infrastructure

Access to broadband, or lack thereof, has become a critical issue affecting Americans across the country, and one that I've consistently and increasingly heard about when meeting with constituents. The COVID-19 pandemic has made it crystal clear that broadband is no longer a luxury, it's an essential service. 

While Ohio ranks in the top 20 states for broadband connectivity, more than 300,000 Buckeye households lack access to high-speed internet. If that’s not enough to convey how dire the situation is, a 2019 study across eight Ohio counties found in rural areas with 20 or fewer households per square mile, 80-90% of households have no access to broadband whatsoever.

That’s why, as a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I’ve made it one of my top priorities to provide the resources necessary to expand broadband access, lower costs, and make it easier for communities to install the physical infrastructure required to connect homes, schools, businesses, and medical facilities to the broadband they need.
 

This pandemic has made the need for expanded broadband connectivity painfully obvious, but the benefits associated with meeting that need are undeniable. Reaching full broadband coverage in Ohio is estimated to generate up to $6.6 billion in economic benefits over the next 15 years. That’s not to mention that the annual telehealth cost savings per facility averages a little over $27,000.

Bridging the digital divide will be complicated, but I firmly believe we can do it if we reach across the aisle and work together with civility and mutual respect. 

You can learn more about the need to expand rural broadband and ways I'm working to do that in Congress here. 

Supporting the Ohio & Erie Canalway

Like many Ohioans, I take great pride in our state's role in building the Ohio & Erie Canal. In total, the Ohio & Erie Canalway National Heritage Area spans more than 110 miles between New Philadelphia and Cleveland, supporting more than 4,200 jobs and generating more than $408 million per year.
 

That's why I joined several of my fellow Buckeyes in Congress - Reps. Tim Ryan, Anthony Gonzalez and Marcy Kaptur, as well as Senators Portman and Brown - in reintroducing a bipartisan bill to support the historic Ohio & Erie Canalway National Heritage Area.

Our legislation will not only protect the Ohio and Erie Canalway National Heritage Area's historic legacy for future generations of Ohioans, but will also ensure it can continue to support thousands of jobs through public-private partnerships and bring economic development to the Buckeye State. 


Enhancing Law Enforcement Response to Domestic Violence Calls 

During my 25 years as a prosecutor, I saw my fair share of terrible crimes but none haunt me so much as those of domestic and sexual violence. Unfortunately, the threat these crimes pose to our communities has grown exponentially as we’ve worked to rein in the COVID-19 pandemic. There's been a spike in calls to domestic violence hotlines and police over the past year as many survivors are isolated or trapped with their abuser due to mandatory quarantines and schools being remote.

It’s critical that we give law enforcement - who are often the first responders to domestic violence incidents - the information and resources they need to effectively address this recent increase in domestic violence crimes. 

That's why I was proud to introduce the bipartisan Domestic Violence Public Health Emergency Guidance Act alongside my colleague Congresswoman Jennifer Wexton. Our bipartisan bill would direct the Department of Justice to work with the Department of Health and Human Services as well as domestic violence and law enforcement stakeholders to issue guidance that highlights promising practices and resources that federal, state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies can adopt to address domestic violence effectively.

The bill would also create a resource guide focused on risk factors unique to COVID-19 that increase the chances of escalation and lethality in domestic violence, training and investigation tools for officers, and resources for survivors during the pandemic. It is my hope that this critical legislation will be brought to the House floor as soon as possible for a vote, so that we can help law enforcement effectively combat these heinous crimes as they continue their lifesaving work under these unprecedented circumstances.

God bless and stay well,

Dave

￼

￼


Rob’s Rundown: Week of February 22 – February 26, 2021 
Senator Portman was in Washington this week as the Senate continued working on a COVID-19 response package. On Monday, Portman was given the distinct honor of delivering President George Washington’s 1796 Farewell Address on the Senate floor. Every year since 1896, the Senate has observed Washington’s Birthday by selecting one of its members, alternating parties, to read the 7,641-word statement in legislative session.
On Tuesday, Portman delivered opening remarks at a joint oversight hearing to examine the security failures that led to a breach of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Portman then questioned the former Chief of the U.S. Capitol Police, Steven Sund; the Acting Chief of the Metropolitan Police Department, Robert Contee; and the former Senate Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper, Michael Stenger; on the lack of Capitol Police preparedness on January 6. Portman made clear that the Capitol Police officers were owed the proper training and equipment to ensure that a tragedy like what occurred on January 6 will not happen again at the Capitol.
On Wednesday evening, Portman delivered remarks on the Senate floor about the addiction crisis in America, which worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overdose deaths across the country continue to rise. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 81,000 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United States in the 12 months ending in May 2020, the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a 12-month period. Portman highlighted two bipartisan bills he introduced this week to respond to this troubling trend: the Telehealth Response for E-prescribing Addiction Therapy Services (TREATS) Act and Federal Initiative to Guarantee Health by Targeting (FIGHT) Fentanyl Act.  
Finally, Portman penned an op-ed in The Washington Post Wednesday evening calling on the Biden administration and Congressional Democrats to reach across the aisle and work with Republican members to craft a targeted bipartisan COVID-19 package. This comes as Democrats are preparing to use the budget reconciliation process to pass their $1.9 trillion COVID-19 bill without Republican support. 
For a more detailed look at Senator Portman’s week, please see the following: 
Monday, February 8, 2021 
Portman Applauds Rule Change Allowing Second Chance Access to Paycheck Protection Program 
Portman praised the announcement by the Biden Administration that Second Chance individuals will no longer be excluded from obtaining Paycheck Protection Program loans, the small business loan relief program created under the bipartisan CARES Act and reauthorized by the FY 2021 Omnibus Spending bill that passed in December, both of which Senator Portman supported.  
The PPP application initially asked applicants to declare unrelated felony records, which prohibited former convicts from accessing the loan program. To address this issue, Portman introduced the bipartisan Paycheck Protection Program Second Chance Act to remove barriers to PPP for owners with unrelated felony records while preserving the presumption of innocence and keeping in place the five year timeframe for felony crimes related to financial fraud. This legislation followed Portman’s letter last year to the Department of the Treasury and the Small Business Administration (SBA) urging that the SBA allow small business owners with criminal records to apply for the PPP. National and Ohioan reentry and second chance coalition leaders, law enforcement, and local officials voiced their support for the initiative.   
In their announcement today, the Biden Administration cited Portman’s legislation as the basis for this rule change. 
""I am pleased that the Biden administration took action to expand Paycheck Protection Program access to Second Chance small business owners,"" said Portman. “This is a long-overdue rule change that we originally sought to address with our bipartisan PPP Second Chance Act, and will ensure that small business owners who have spent time in the criminal justice system are not defined by their past mistakes, and instead have equal access to these invaluable small business loans that have helped thousands stay in business through the COVID-19 pandemic.""  
Portman, Manchin Introduce Bipartisan FIGHT Fentanyl Act to Permanently Schedule Fentanyl-Related Substances 
Senators Rob Portman and Joe Manchin (D-WV) today introduced the bipartisan Federal Initiative to Guarantee Health by Targeting (FIGHT) Fentanyl Act to permanently schedule illicitly manufactured and deadly fentanyl. In February 2018, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) issued a temporary scheduling order to schedule fentanyl-related substances that has allowed federal law enforcement authorities to bring criminal actions against individuals who manufacture, distribute, or handle fentanyl-related substances. This scheduling order is set to expire on May 6, 2022. The FIGHT Fentanyl Act codifies DEA precedent to permanently schedule fentanyl-related substances.    
Overdose deaths across the country due to fentanyl-related substances continue to rise, which is causing a significant impact on communities across the country.  According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 81,000 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United States in the 12 months ending in May 2020, the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a 12-month period. 
""Fentanyl hit Ohio communities particularly hard, especially during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The most recent 12-month data we have shows the highest number of overdose deaths in the history of the United States and I’m deeply troubled that the full-year data for 2020 will be even higher,"" said Senator Portman. ""This deadly, synthetic drug knows no zip code and is devastating individuals and families all across the country. This bipartisan legislation is vital to our efforts to keep fentanyl out of our communities, and I urge my colleagues to join Senator Manchin and me in passing this common-sense legislation."" 
Portman Statement on OMB Director Nominee Neera Tanden 
Senator Portman Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, issued the following statement on Neera Tanden, nominee to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB):  
""When President Biden announced his intention to nominate Ms. Tanden as OMB Director, I expressed concern and urged him to reconsider. As a former OMB Director, I know that the OMB Director has to be able to work productively with members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. I believe that the tone, the content, and the aggressive partisanship of some of Ms. Tanden’s public statements will make it more difficult for her to work effectively with both parties in this role. I’m also concerned about her decision to delete thousands of tweets in the month after the election and the lack of transparency in her decision to do so, as well as her lack of experience on key issues for OMB, such as the regulatory and budgeting processes. While the president has the right to choose his own Cabinet, and thus far I have supported all of this administration’s nominees, I will not be supporting the confirmation of Ms. Tanden."" 
Portman, Whitehouse Introduce Bipartisan Legislation to Increase Access to Telehealth Services for Substance Use Disorder Treatment  
Senators Rob Portman and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) introduced the Telehealth Response for E-prescribing Addiction Therapy Services (TREATS) Act to support the expansion of telehealth services for substance use disorder treatment. The bill would build upon the Trump Administration’s action to waive regulatory restrictions for accessing care in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the temporary waivers provide a necessary reprieve for patients so that they may continue their treatments and counseling virtually, they are time-limited and will ultimately expire at the conclusion of the Public Health Emergency. 
The TREATS Act would extend these telehealth flexibilities by making permanent key waivers, including the ability to prescribe Medication Assisted Therapies (MAT) and other necessary drugs without needing a prior in-person visit and the ability to bill Medicare for audio-only telehealth services.  By taking these steps, the TREATS Act will increase overall access to MAT and support telehealth needs in rural communities where broadband may be needed. 
""The COVID-19 pandemic has affected every aspect of our lives and the increase in overdoses we’re seeing only increases the need for additional flexibility to help those suffering from addiction. I’ve had the opportunity to hear about the successes of telehealth in treating substance use disorder directly from behavioral health providers who have continued their fight against the addiction epidemic amidst the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” said Portman. “The rollout of telehealth waivers has both helped patients maintain access to care safely at home and increased access to care for those who didn’t otherwise have access to in-person treatment. As we move forward and look to life beyond this pandemic, we must make sure that the advances to care and access that telehealth is currently providing are not lost, and that’s exactly what this bill will do. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this common-sense legislation to make telehealth a permanent part of substance abuse disorder treatment.""  
Portman Honored to Deliver President George Washington’s 1796 Farewell Address on Senate Floor 
Portman was given the distinct honor of delivering President George Washington’s 1796 Farewell Address on the Senate floor. Every year since 1896, the Senate has observed Washington’s Birthday by selecting one of its members, alternating parties, to read the 7,641-word statement in legislative session.

Portman, Bipartisan Colleagues Introduce Conservation Legislation to Protect Tropical Forests & Coral Reef Ecosystems 
Senator Portman, along with Senators Chris Coons (D-DE), Richard Burr (R-NC), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), and Brian Schatz (D-HI) introduced the Tropical Forest and Coral Reef Conservation Reauthorization Act of 2021. U.S. Representatives Steve Chabot and Brad Sherman (D-CA) have introduced companion legislation in the House. 
This legislation reauthorizes a program, known as a debt-for-nature-swap, that allows developing countries that meet certain criteria to be relieved of debt owed to the United States in exchange for protecting and preserving tropical forests and coral reefs. This legislation reauthorizes the program, which was first created in 1998, for FY 2022 through FY 2026, at $20 million per year. Since its inception, this program has helped protect more than 67 million acres of tropical forests, which has not only preserved native wildlife and ecosystems, but has also helped protect the environment by sequestering over 50 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, which is the equivalent of taking more than 11 million cars off the road.
""This bipartisan legislation takes significant strides to protect our natural resources for the next generation while strengthening ties with countries that could become significant economic and national security partners with the United States,” said Portman, Co-Chair of the International Conservation Caucus. “This is a common-sense and proven approach that has protected millions of acres of tropical forest from deforestation – one of the leading causes of greenhouse gas emissions. I want to thank Senator Coons, Burr, Whitehouse, and Schatz for their support of this legislation and urge my colleagues to join us in ensuring that our natural resources are protected and preserved for the next generation.""

Portman Delivers Opening Remarks at Joint HSGAC & Rules Oversight Hearing on Breach of U.S. Capitol on January 6
Portman, Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, delivered opening remarks at a joint oversight hearing to examine the security failures that led to a breach of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Current and former officials responsible for securing the area surrounding the U.S. Capitol on the preparations and response efforts on January 6, 2021, when a criminal mob was able to breach the Capitol complex, testified at today’s hearing. Portman made clear that the following key questions need to be answered by the witnesses: Was there credible intelligence about potential violence; when was it known; and who knew it? Did the U.S. Capitol Police request approval to seek National Guard assistance prior to January 6, and if so, why that request was denied? Were Capitol Police officers were properly trained and equipped to respond to an attack on the Capitol, and if not, why not?

Portman, Stabenow, Braun, Peters, Baldwin Introduce Bipartisan Bill to Strengthen American Manufacturing and Create Jobs Across the Country 
Senators Rob Portman, Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), Mike Braun (R-IN), Gary Peters (D-MI), and Tammy Baldwin (D-WI) introduced their bipartisan bill to strengthen our Buy American laws. The Make It in America Act will make it harder for federal agencies to use waivers to get around Buy American requirements, requiring the federal government to give preference to American companies and spend taxpayer dollars on American-made products and American jobs.  
""We must do everything we can to protect and maximize American jobs, and that starts by ensuring that our tax dollars aren’t used to create jobs overseas,” said Senator Portman. ""By improving transparency, the Make It in America Act will encourage federal agencies to support American workers and American jobs by faithfully complying with Buy American law. This is a bipartisan bill that is needed now to help protect American jobs."" 
Roll Call: “Washington’s Farewell Gets Personal for Retiring Sen. Portman"" 
A new story published this morning in Roll Call highlights Senator Portman’s thoughts and reflections on delivering President George Washington’s 1796 Farewell Address on the Senate floor. Every year since 1896, the Senate has observed Washington’s Birthday by selecting one of its members, alternating parties, to read the 7,641-word statement in legislative session. It remains today one of the Senate’s oldest, most cherished traditions. Of note in the story is this excerpt: 
Senators read the words of President George Washington’s 1796 Farewell Address each year on the floor of the Senate — it’s an enduring chamber tradition. It was an especially meaningful tradition this year for Sen. Rob Portman. 
Washington in his letter to “Friends and Fellow-Citizens” described why he would be leaving a life of public service, something personal to Portman, who has announced he will not run for reelection in 2022.  
""He felt like he’d done his duty and it was time for others,” the Ohio Republican said.  
The speech bidding the country goodbye was penned by America’s first president weeks before electors cast ballots in the third American presidential election. The campaign was bitterly fought, and it was the first contested election in the country’s history in which political parties played a role. 
….  
""It’s timeless,” Portman said. “And it’s timely because, you know, here we are in a period of our country’s history when we just came through a contentious election and impeachment and in the middle of a crisis, and people are really divided.""

Portman, Brown, Joyce, and Ryan Reintroduce Bipartisan Legislation to Extend Funding for Ohio & Erie Canalway National Heritage Area 
Senators Rob Portman and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) have reintroduced their bipartisan legislation to increase investment in the Ohio & Erie Canalway National Heritage Area by extending the funding reauthorization for an additional 15 years, through 2036, and increasing the funding cap by $10 million. The Ohio & Erie Canalway National Heritage Area spans more than 110 miles between New Philadelphia and Cleveland. This bill will help ensure it can continue to draw investment, and support local jobs, tourism, and economic development in northeast Ohio. Representatives Dave Joyce and Tim Ryan (D-OH) are leading the House version of the bill, which is also sponsored by Representatives Anthony Gonzalez and Marcy Kaptur (D-OH). 
""This legislation will provide greater funding certainty to continue the public-private partnerships that have protected and improved the Ohio & Erie Canalway National Heritage Area, which will help bring jobs and investments to the area,” said Portman. “The canal holds great significance to the state of Ohio, from helping our early towns and communities prosper to linking our state to the rest of the nation. I am proud to be one of the 2.5 million visitors who enjoy the canal’s towpath trail each year, and I look forward to working with my colleagues in both the Senate and the House on getting this legislation signed into law"" 
Portman, Romney, Rubio, Grassley Urge President to Implement Rule on Confucius Institutes 
Senators Rob Portman, Mitt Romney (R-UT), Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Chuck Grassley (R-IA) urged the Biden Administration to implement the proposed rule requiring U.S. academic institutions disclose their relationships with Confucius Institutes, which are funded by the Chinese Communist Party. The letter reflects a similar effort in the House of Representatives. 
""We have significant concerns regarding the CCP’s nefarious actions and urge you to follow through on your commitments to advancing the interests of the American people as we collectively respond to the challenge that the CCP poses,” the senators wrote. “We believe it is critically important to better understand and reduce the CCP’s influence on the American people, including through the Hanban, its propaganda arm that runs Confucius Institutes through the PRC Ministry of Education. The proposed rule is a necessary step in that effort and would bring needed transparency to Confucius Institutes.""

Portman Op-Ed: Biden Promised Bipartisanship. That Rhetoric Hasn’t Been Matched By Action. 
Senator Portman penned an op-ed in The Washington Post this evening calling on the Biden Administration and Congressional Democrats to reach across the aisle and work with Republican members to craft a targeted bipartisan COVID-19 package. This comes as Democrats are preparing to use reconciliation to jam through a partisan, $1.9 trillion COVID-19 bill without Republican support.  
Both parties have worked together to enact five COVID-19 packages since the beginning of this crisis. All five have garnered overwhelming bipartisan support.

On CBS This Morning, Senator Portman Discusses Bipartisan Oversight Hearing into Capitol Riot 
On CBS This Morning, Senator Portman discussed the bipartisan investigation he is co-leading in the Senate into the January 6 Capitol riot that resulted in seven deaths, including three police officers. Yesterday, Portman, as Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), questioned the current and former officials responsible for securing the Capitol on January 6 during a joint hearing of HSGAC and the Senate Rules Committee. He stressed the need for greater coordination between law enforcement and intelligence groups to effectively respond to significant threats.

Portman, Carper Applaud Treasury Department’s Sanctions Targeting Leaders of Burmese Military Coup and Urge Biden Administration to Heed Bipartisan Recommendations Regarding Future Penalties  
In a letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Senators Portman and Tom Carper (D-DE), Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and a senior Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, respectively, commended President Biden’s Execution Order 14014, which placed sanctions on individuals and entities linked to the military coup in Burma earlier this month. Specifically, the bipartisan lawmakers applauded the implementation of financial penalties  on immediate family members of sanctioned individuals -- a key recommendation made by the Senators in their July 2020 Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) report, which exposed how U.S. policies have been exploited by individuals to undermine and evade sanctions. In the letter, the Senator also urged the Administration to place sanctions on the family members of Burmese officials immediately. 
""We are pleased to see that under Executive Order 14014, the Treasury Department can target the spouses and adult children of sanctioned Burmese individuals,” the senators wrote. “Given this known practice of transferring assets to family members to evade sanctions, we urge the Treasury Department to swiftly consider additional sanctions against the relatives of designated Burmese officials.""  
In their letter, the senators also asked the Biden Administration to consider that future sanctions be announced and implemented simultaneously to stop individuals from exploiting delays to evade sanctions – another recommendation made by the Senators in their 2020 report which would limit the opportunity for individuals to transfer before sanctions were put into place.  
The senators continued, “Our July 2020 report also demonstrated the dangers associated with delays between the general announcement of sanctions and naming specific individuals and entities to the SDN List.  In the case of the recent Burma-related sanctions, the Treasury Department did not name the first set of specific individuals and entities until February 11, 2021—one day after President Biden announced his intention to impose sanctions. While brief, this 24-hour window raises the possibility that newly-designated Burmese individuals and entities could have transferred significant assets from or through the United States immediately prior to their inclusion on the SDN list. This risk is even more pronounced for the two individuals the Treasury Department added to the SDN List on February 22, 2021.""  
BACKGROUND:  
In July of 2020, Senators Portman and Carper, as the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation (PSI), released a bipartisan report detailing how Russian oligarchs exploited the secrecy of the art industry to evade U.S. sanctions. In that report, the Senators outlined key recommendations to close loopholes in our policies that were being utilized by foreign actors to avoid sanctions, including asking the Treasury Department to 1) impose sanctions on the immediate family members of sanctioned individuals to stop the transfer of assets to family members, and 2) take necessary actions to both announce and implement sanctions concurrently to avoid creating a window of opportunity for individuals to transfer assets before sanctions were put into action.

Portman Introduces Bill to Strengthen E-Verify & Prevent Future Illegal Immigration 
Portman introduced the E-Verify Act, legislation to require employers to use an electronic employment verification (E-Verify) system in order to stem the tide of illegal immigration. Currently, the E-Verify program is an optional pilot program for most employers, and it has significant limitations—primarily, it does not sufficiently validate the authenticity of the identity documents new employees present to their employers.  Senator Portman’s version of E-Verify will validate each new employee’s identity and work authorization status.  Federal Reserve economists found that when states have mandated the use of E-Verify, it  “reduces the total number of likely unauthorized immigrants who stay in that state by about 10 percent.""  
""The goal of E-Verify is to provide a simple, reliable way for employers to confirm a new employee’s work eligibility and identity,” said Portman. “Since the program is optional, however, it has failed to eliminate the job magnet that remains a draw for unauthorized workers.  This measure requires all employers to use E-Verify going forward and it would strengthen the E-Verify system to help curtail the widespread unauthorized employment that fuels illegal immigration.""  
Citing Increasing Overdose Levels During Pandemic, Portman Highlights Bipartisan Legislation to Address Addiction on Senate Floor 
On the Senate Floor, Portman spoke about the addiction crisis in America, which worsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Overdose deaths across the country continue to rise. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 81,000 drug overdose deaths occurred in the United States in the 12 months ending in May 2020, the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a 12-month period.   
Portman highlighted two bipartisan bills he introduced this week to respond to this troubling trend. First, his Telehealth Response for E-prescribing Addiction Therapy Services (TREATS) Act will support the expansion of telehealth services for substance use disorder treatment. The bill would build upon the Trump Administration’s action to waive regulatory restrictions for accessing care in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Second, his Federal Initiative to Guarantee Health by Targeting (FIGHT) Fentanyl Act will permanently schedule dangerous fentanyl-related substances. In February 2018, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) issued a temporary scheduling order to schedule fentanyl-related substances that allowed federal law enforcement authorities to bring criminal actions against individuals who manufacture, distribute, or handle fentanyl-related substances. This scheduling order is set to expire on May 6, 2022. The FIGHT Fentanyl Act codifies DEA precedent to permanently schedule fentanyl-related substances.  
Lastly, he discussed his CARA 2.0 legislation he will soon reintroduce to increase the funding authorization levels for the Comprehensive Addiction & Recovery Act (CARA) programs enacted in 2016 and put in place additional policy reforms to help combat the opioid epidemic that has worsened during the coronavirus pandemic

Portman, Romney, Cotton, Capito, Collins Introduce Bill to Raise Minimum Wage, Protect Jobs for Legal Workers 
Senators Rob Portman, Mitt Romney (R-UT), Tom Cotton (R-AR), Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV), and Susan Collins (R-ME) today introduced the Higher Wages for American Workers Act, legislation which would gradually raise the federal minimum wage to $10 and mandate E-Verify to ensure the wage increase only goes to legal workers. The bill will also index future minimum wage increases to inflation and includes protections for small businesses. 
Earlier this week, Senator Portman introduced the E-Verify Act, legislation to require employers to use an electronic employment verification (E-Verify) system in order to stem the tide of illegal immigration. Currently, the E-Verify program is an optional pilot program for most employers, and it has significant limitations—primarily, it does not sufficiently validate the authenticity of the identity documents new employees present to their employers.  Senator Portman’s version of E-Verify will validate each new employee’s identity and work authorization status.  Federal Reserve economists found that when states have mandated the use of E-Verify, it “reduces the total number of likely unauthorized immigrants who stay in that state by about 10 percent."" 
""For years I have supported the way Ohio handles the minimum wage by indexing it to inflation. This takes some of the politics out of the issue, provides more certainty for small businesses and workers, and prevents the sudden spikes that cost jobs,"" Senator Portman said. “I’m pleased to support this legislation to provide a responsible and gradual increase to the federal minimum wage after this pandemic ends and then indexing the minimum wage to inflation moving forward.  This approach will give both businesses and people the certainty they need and deserve. It also ensures that younger employees seeking their first job are not priced out of the workforce. Unlike the Democrats’ proposal, this bill would protect tipped workers by ensuring they are still able to work in a capacity that ensures they have larger take-home pay. This legislation also ensures the use of E-Verify. I’ve taken a lead on advocating for a workable E-Verify because of its proven effectiveness of deterring unlawful immigration and helping employers ensure they are hiring Americans. Hiring Americans for jobs available across the country will be crucial as our economy continues to reopen and businesses get back on their feet."" 
At Finance Hearing, Portman Secures Commitment from USTR Nominee to Conduct Top-to-Bottom Review of U.S.-China Trade Relationship, Pursue Reform at World Trade Organization 
At a Senate Finance Committee hearing, the nominee to be the U.S. Trade Representative, Katherine Tai, committed to Portman that if she were to be confirmed for the position, she would work to conduct a “Top to Bottom Review” of the U.S.-China relationship. She also committed to pursuing reform opportunities at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and aggressively challenge China’s non-market techno-nationalism. Senator Portman, as former U.S. Trade Representative during President George W. Bush’s administration, conducted the first “Top to Bottom Review” on China 16 years ago, which warned of many of the present challenges in the U.S.-China relationship. Updating the review will ensure that U.S. trade policy accounts for the latest developments in Sino-American economic relations. 
Portman believes reform of the WTO is necessary in order to put America on the same level playing field as the rest of the world.  Last year, Senators Portman and Ben Cardin (D-MD) introduced a bipartisan resolution expressing support for U.S. leadership at the WTO while also calling for reform to parts of the institution. The resolution describes the long history of productive American leadership at the WTO, as well as the ways in which the WTO has failed to address new trade barriers and market distortions by countries like China. The resolution also offers specific reform proposals of the WTO.

Biden is repeating Obama’s first mistake 
Our country seems more divided along partisan lines than at any time I can remember. That’s why I was pleased to hear President Biden encourage bipartisanship in his inaugural address. I agree with his statement that, at “our historic moment of crisis and challenge ... unity is the path forward.” Unfortunately, that rhetoric has not yet been matched by action.
Most disappointing is the partisan approach the new administration is taking to the covid-19 pandemic, one of the few areas where there has been real bipartisanship over the past year. We know covid policy can be bipartisan, because Congress already passed five laws appropriating more than $4 trillion with huge bipartisan majorities. The most recent $900 billion package passed at the end of December by a vote of 92 to 6.
The basis for this year-end legislation came from a bipartisan group of five Democrats and five Republicans who worked over several weeks to come up with the $900 billion consensus package. As a member of that group, I am convinced we can find that common ground again.
Yet the new administration has chosen to go around Republicans this time, not just by proposing a huge $1.9 trillion package with no consultation with any Republican — or Democrat — in the bipartisan working group, but also by trying to pass the $1.9 trillion plan under reconciliation, bypassing the normal 60-vote Senate margin. In a 50-50 Senate, Democrats seem determined to proceed without a single Republican vote.
Trying to find a way forward together, I worked with nine of my Republican Senate colleagues over the past month to develop a targeted $618 billion covid-19 response proposal that can gain significant bipartisan support",

Working to Improve Care for New Mothers
In recent years, physicians and researchers have placed a heightened focus on preventable pregnancy-related deaths in the United States. Pregnant women on Medicaid are more likely to experience higher rates of severe maternal morbidity and mortality than pregnant women with private health insurance. To better assist states in reducing these rates, Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and I have reintroduced our bipartisan Supporting Best Practices for Healthy Moms Act.
As many as two-thirds of deaths resulting from pregnancy or childbirth may be preventable. This legislation will help improve health outcomes for pregnant women and mothers enrolled in Medicaid by increasing information and resources to better monitor and treat at-risk pregnancies, as well as inform Congress on policies that may assist states in reducing maternal deaths. I am glad Senator Brown and I are continuing this important effort, and am hopeful our colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join us in reducing maternal deaths.

Update on COVID-19
While COVID-19 vaccines are now available, the threat of this virus is still very real. It remains important that people continue to follow CDC recommendations: adhere to social distancing guidelines, wash your hands often, and wear a mask if you are heading out. Remember: my mask protects you and your mask protects me.
According to the Pennsylvania Department of Health, across the state as of Friday, February 26, 2021:
	•	Over 15% of all hospital beds were available (pre-COVID, approximately 36.82% of hospital beds were typically available)
	•	Over 75% of ventilators were available
	•	Over 20% of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds were available (pre-COVID, approximately 32.6% of ICU beds were typically available)
As of that date, positive cases in Pennsylvania reached 926,336, roughly a 0.4% increase from the prior day, and more than 3,863,935 tests had come back negative. This means just over 81% of Pennsylvanians tested for COVID-19 had a result that came back negative.

9% Is All You Get 
9%...that's it...

Only 9% of the Democrats’ $1.9 TRILLION COVID-19 package is actually for COVID-19 relief.

The other 91% is funding their extreme agenda. 
￼
Why Is This Even an Argument? 
Why is this even an argument? If a 9/11 style commission is created to look into the events of Jan. 6, why would it NOT be equally bipartisan?

Findings need to be made based on facts and evidence, not political bias and pressure from Speaker Pelosi.

Biden’s DHS Is Making a Grave Mistake
It’s shocking that Biden’s DHS would rather frantically “prepare for another border crisis” than actually work to STOP the border crisis.

Strong border security = a safer and more humane immigration system.

Another Democrat Double Standard 
Democrats continue to ignore Rep. Eric Swalwell's relationship with a known Chinese spy and happily let him keep his seat on the House Intelligence Committee. A ridiculous double standard.

Remembering William B. Travis' ""Victory or Death"" Letter
Wednesday marked the 185th anniversary of the “Victory or Death” letter that William Barret Travis composed at the beginning of the 13-day siege during, what would soon be known as, the Battle of the Alamo.

As a former board member of the Texas Historical Commission, and lifelong student of history, I believe that William B. Travis, Davy Crockett, Jim Bowie, and the many other Alamo defenders remain some of the finest Texans and Americans to have ever walked this planet.

Congressman McHenry Weekly Update 


Voting NO to the Pelosi/Biden Pork-laden Spending Bill



In the face of this ongoing pandemic, what the American people need is targeted, temporary relief that is directly related to COVID. While we should be focused on getting kids into classrooms and vaccines into arms, Democrats are instead pushing through a progressive wish list that—as the chart below illustrates—dedicates only 9 percent of its $1.9 trillion price tag to actually combatting the virus. If Democrats had worked with Republicans, we could have voted to provide the COVID-related relief Americans need to help end this nightmare. 

￼

Late Friday night, I delivered remarks on the House Floor condemning this bill and calling for bipartisan action to provide targeted COVID-19 relief for Americans in need. Click here or on the image below to watch the speech.

￼

Earlier on Friday, I testified before the House Rules Committee to highlight the failures of this legislation and the House Financial Services Committee's Democrats refusal to work with Republicans to find bipartisan solutions to the pandemic. Click here or on the image below to watch.

Supporting Farmers During the Pandemic



Agriculture is the number one industry in North Carolina and is a leading industry in the Tenth District. Additionally, over 5,700 families across our state are involved in poultry and egg farming. Yet currently, broiler-breeders who contract with larger companies are not eligible to participate in the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program (CFAP) despite the important role they play in our food system. That is why I joined with my colleagues Congressmen Ted Budd (NC-13) and Dan Bishop (NC-9) in sending a letter to Secretary of Agriculture Kevin Shea to advocate for a correction in how this key CARES Act program to assist farmers is implemented. Click here or on the image below to read our letter and learn why this needs to change.

This Week in the Financial Services Committee



Last week, I delivered opening remarks at the House Financial Services Committee hearing with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, Jerome Powell. The hearing was held to discuss the state of the economy, monetary policy, and the Federal Reserve’s response to the COVID-19 crisis. In my remarks I highlighted the importance of targeted and temporary relief that is directly related to COVID to help the many Americans still suffering from the impact of the pandemic.

What I Have Been Reading



Kernersville police officer who was shot Sunday is in critical but stable condition

Winston-Salem Journal 

Please join me in praying for the family and loved ones of Kernersville Police Officer Sean Houle, who was shot in the line of duty last week. I was glad to hear that Officer Houle is now in stable condition. Every day, our law enforcement officers put their lives on the line to keep our communities safe. I am grateful for these brave men and women and their service to the Tenth District.
                                            

‘Entire community helped make it a great day’

Statesville Record & Landmark

In honor of Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, the Iredell County community came together to provide lunch for local law enforcement officers. The event was so successful that the Mooresville, Troutman and Statesville Police Departments, the Iredell County Sheriff’s Office, and firemen at the downtown Statesville fire station were provided lunch. It is great to see the community coming together to give back to local law enforcement officers.

Focusing On Real Relief To Defeat COVID-19
 
  Dear Neighbor,  This week, we were proud to introduce bills to help the American people during the pandemic. We introduced “Crush The Virus” Act, a standalone, $163 billion relief legislation focused on crushing the COVID-19 virus. This act specifically prioritizes the health and safety of the American people by:
 
	•	Providing direct funds to increase the distribution and administration of COVID-19 vaccines
	•	Boosting access to COVID-19 testing throughout the nation
	•	Supporting additional medical research into new emerging variants, among other public health initiatives.
 
While more must be done, passing this type of targeted relief legislation would ensure we immediately address the public health needs of the country and accelerate the defeat of COVID-19.
 
Unfortunately, many of my colleagues in Congress were satisfied to push a bloated, partisan package that does nothing to ensure aid actually reaches those in desperate need of support. They even blocked a vote on our BIPARTISAN amendment to stop felons, including child molesters, rapists, and other public predators from receiving a stimulus check.
 
We also introduced the New Markets Tax Credit Extension Act of 2021 with Rep. Terri Sewell to spur economic revitalization in low-income rural communities and urban neighborhoods as the COVID-19 pandemic and economic crisis continues. As our nation recovers from the public health and economic impacts of COVID-19, we must do everything we can to uplift and stand with historically underserved communities.  Getting these bills passed are crucial to getting help to the American people who need it desperately. People are suffering and are in need of immediate relief – we cannot wait to act.  Until Next Time,  Tom

Friends,

As the Biden Administration and Congressional Democrats continue to wage war on the West and the American Worker, I remain committed to fighting for our interests by defending our constitutional rights, advocating for American energy, supporting American jobs, and securing our nation from our adversaries.

House Democrats Fail The American People

Speaker Pelosi and her party failed the American people by bringing to the floor a nearly $2 trillion bill that does more to advance their political priorities than address the serious issues we face. 

Congress kept us in the fight against COVID-19 last year by passing five bipartisan, targeted relief bills. Unfortunately, the legislation we voted on Friday night did not continue this trend and received bipartisan opposition instead. That's because the final product represented a payoff to the left, bailing out states like California, subsidizing Planned Parenthood, and empowering our educators to remain out of the classroom while focusing just 9% of the onslaught of spending on COVID health issues. Democrats also gave Republicans no voice in the crafting of this legislation, resulting in a bloated bill that will make our recovery efforts more difficult and will force our children and grandchildren to pick up the cost.
 
Rather than this partisan approach, we should be working to reopen schools across the country, rebuild our economy, and defeat the virus. I will continue to fight for those priorities and push back against Democrats' efforts to politicize the challenges our country is facing. 
Biden's Heartless Actions Will Damage The Economy, Energy Industry, Families, and Kill Jobs: 
As the Vice Chair of the Congressional Western Caucus, I had the opportunity to co-chair a virtual hearing focused on the Biden Administration's efforts to threaten our energy security and our economy.

We were lucky to be joined by Dr. Tim Considine from the University of Wyoming's School of Energy Resources and Dr. Glen Murrell from the Wyoming Energy Authority. It was great to hear from them and other energy leaders and experts as they discussed the implications of the Biden Administration's executive orders.

In my opening remarks, I explained how the President's initial executive orders represent a war on the West that will hurt Wyoming and rural communities throughout the country. 

Watch the video of my opening remarks here, and see an excerpt of my comments below: 
￼ 
REP. LIZ CHENEY: Despite the rhetoric we’ve seen from the Administration, unfortunately these initial moves are nothing short of heartless. They damage the economy, they damage the energy industry, they damage our families, they take away jobs, they hurt individuals. They’re really misguided efforts to placate the far-left. I’m hopeful that the Administration will rethink these efforts and will turn them around through efforts like the one we’re engaged in today. So, with that, let me thank you very much, Chairman Newhouse, and I’ll turn things back over to you. 
Biden's Executive Orders Are Nothing Short Of Heartless:  
At this week's House Republican leadership press conference, I delivered remarks pointing out the Biden Administration's heartless policies that wage war on the West and the American worker. The Administration needs to understand the impact that their orders will have on states like Wyoming. I am committed to standing against these dangerous policies and ensuring we are equipped to face the economic challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Watch the video here, and see an excerpt of my remarks below: 
￼ 
REP. LIZ CHENEY: And so, when you look at things like the executive orders, and in particular the cancellation of the Keystone Pipeline, the executive orders banning oil and gas drilling on federal lands. Those executive orders are nothing short of heartless. It is really important – we want to make sure, particularly for a state like mine, that the Administration understands the impact of those kinds of orders. The extent to which when you ban new permits for fossil fuel exploration on public lands, it kills economies, it kills jobs, it means we don’t have funding for our schools, and it is important for the American people to understand and recognize that no matter what you’re hearing from this Administration, what they are doing is a war on the West, and it is a war on the American worker. People are losing their jobs, they’re losing their livelihoods, and we as Republicans are committed to turning that around. We are committed to standing against those policies, to making sure that we are able to get access to our fossil fuels, and making sure that we’re able to bring jobs back and get our economy growing as we come back from the devastation of COVID. 
Land Grab Is The Latest Plank In Democrats' Heartless Agenda: 
On Friday, I voted against H.R. 803, a Democrat proposed federal public land grab package that would kill jobs and further weaken our energy industry. 

Over the last month, we have seen heartless policies from President Biden and Speaker Pelosi. Through executive orders and legislative action, they have declared war on the West and war on the American worker. 

The agenda the Democrats have pushed will destroy jobs and opportunities, threatening our way of life. People in Wyoming and in rural communities across the nation depend on our land and our resources. Democrats are turning their backs on these Americans by locking that land up. This bill also takes another step toward limiting domestic energy production, which will result in higher costs for families and embolden our adversaries. 

I have already introduced legislation that would prevent President Biden's damaging executive orders from taking effect. In addition to fighting for those, I will continue to push back against Democrats’ politically-motivated policies that unfairly target the people of Wyoming and individuals across rural America.  
A Haaland-Led Interior Department Would Be Bad For Wyoming And The Nation: 
Next week, the Senate will hold the confirmation vote for Rep. Deb Haaland to become the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior. This past week, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee wrapped up their hearing to consider her nomination. 

The hearings on Deb Haaland's nomination only further emphasized that her Interior Department would be harmful for Wyoming and harmful for the nation. Rep. Haaland has a proven track record of hostility to energy production and fossil fuels.These critical resources that she has supported outlawing are essential for powering our nation, creating jobs, giving families a reliable income source, and providing critical revenue for our state. 

Our state and our nation cannot afford to have a DOI that is more focused on enacting Speaker Pelosi and Democrats' radical Green New Deal than protecting the interests of millions of Americans. 
Biden's Rejoining Of Paris Agreement Will Have Consequences: 
Last week, I joined my colleagues of the House Energy Action Team in opposing the Biden Administration's decision to officially rejoin the Paris Agreement.

The Paris Accord is a harmful agreement based on flawed science. It subjects the United States to impossible requirements that will destroy jobs in Wyoming and across the country, while allowing other nations with horrible environmental track records to continue to operate without consequences. President Biden’s decision to rejoin this deal is entirely motivated by politics, which provides no relief to the American people who will lose their jobs or pay higher energy bills as a result of their decision. 
We Will Ensure That The Forces Of Freedom Prevail In The Decades To Come:  
On Tuesday, I delievered the keynote address at a virtual event hosted by the Reagan Insitute that focused on, ""Building a 21st-Century Foreign Policy."" Full video of my speech can be seen here and an excerpt of my remarks can be found below: 
￼ 
REP. LIZ CHENEY: The freedom that we all defend belongs not to us. It belongs to our children and grandchildren. To them, we owe fidelity to the Constitution and a duty to uphold our oath, an oath we swore under God, to do everything necessary to defend it. 

That is, at its core, the great strength of this greatest nation on earth. We have guided and led the world in the triumph of freedom since World War II. Those of us who care deeply about our history and our future, who take our oaths and our obligations seriously, will steer our party and our nation into the future. We will right the unforgivable wrongs of January 6. We will make our party worthy once again of the mantle of Lincoln and of Reagan. And we will ensure that the forces of freedom prevail in the decades to come.  
Protecting Veterans' Second Amendment Rights: 
On Wednesday, I joined my colleague Rep. Mike Bost, the top Republican on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, in introducing ""The Veterans’ Second Amendment Protection Act"". This bill is designed to protect veterans’ ability to purchase and own a firearm.

The Veterans' 2nd Amendment Protection Act would block Veterans' Affairs (VA) from sending information on veterans (or beneficiaries) who are assisted by a fiduciary to the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) without a judicial ruling that they are a danger to themselves or others. This would ensure that veterans are given the same due process that every other American receives before any action is taken that would deprive them of one of the constitutional rights that they fought to protect.

No one, especially those who risked their lives defending our nation, should have their constitutional rights infringed. The legislation that Rep. Bost and I introduced will guarantee that the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding veterans are not delayed by government red tape, and will prevent unelected bureaucrats from denying veterans of their ability to purchase or own a firearm. I will fight hard to advance this legislation and bring attention to this important issue. 
Responding To Democrat Calls To Restructure Nuclear Command:  
This week, House Democrats wrote a letter encouraging President Biden to modify our nations nuclear command. I joined House Armed Services Committee Ranking Member Mike Rogers (R-AL), and House Armed Services Subcommittee on Strategic Forces Ranking Member Michael Turner (R-OH) in responding to the Democrats' dangerous proposal.

The President of the United States must have the exclusive ability to command and control our nuclear deterrent. The Democrats' dangerous efforts suggesting a restructuring of our nuclear command and control process will undermine American security, as well as the security of our allies. The Democrats' proposals, if implemented, would leave our country vulnerable, destabilize the nuclear balance, and weaken our allies' confidence in the nuclear umbrella. Russia's Vladimir Putin and China's Xi Jinping would cheer if the United States enacted such a unilateral restriction.

The ability to take action during an attack is imperative to deterring a preemptive strike from our adversaries. America should never adopt policies or create bureaucratic red tape that would give our adversaries an advantage. 
Resolution To Maintain Sanctions On Iran: 
I joined Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI), Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR), and 41 other members of Congress in introducing a resolution opposing efforts to end sanctions on Iran. It is important that the United States maintain sanctions on Iran until their regime puts an end to their nuclear-weapon program and no longer sponsors terrorists. Iran exploited the weak policies of the Obama Administration and it is imperative that President Biden does not repeat those same mistakes. 
Legislation To Establish A National Uranium Reserve: 
On Thursday, Rep. Bob Latta (R-OH) and I re-introduced the ""Nuclear Prosperity and Security Act"". We led similar legislation in the 116th Congress. This bill will direct the Secretary of Energy to establish and operate a uranium reserve in the United States, which would ensure the availability of uranium in the event of a market disruption and support fuel cycle capabilities for our country. 

Wyoming’s cherished resources are essential to America’s economic and national security, and it is crucial that our nation makes use of them to once again become a global leader in uranium production. That’s why I’m proud to sponsor legislation establishing a domestic uranium reserve, which will boost critical workforces and production while ensuring that we do not have to rely on our adversaries for this essential resource. We must restore our nation’s nuclear leadership -- and doing so starts with Wyoming. 
Reintroducing The Grizzly Bear State Management Act: 
I recently reintroduced ""The Grizzly Bear State Management Act,"" legislation that would direct the Department of the Interior to re-issue its delisting decision and prohibit further judicial review of this decision.

This bill would return the management of the Grizzly to the state-level, where it belongs. The federal government or unelected judges and bureaucrats should not be in the business of telling us how to operate. The state and people of Wyoming know what’s best for Wyoming. 

The bill would also stop the abuse of the court system by environmental extremists and safeguard the scientifically proven delisting determination so that politically-motivated conservations cannot take advantage of that process. 

I was proud to work on this legislation for years with Senator Enzi and will continue to fight for it in the House of Representatives while working with my colleagues to fight for Wyoming’s statutory right to manage our wildlife.

2/28/21 17:22,Help is just around the corner!,"￼ 
Friends,   Over the last month we’ve been working hard with the Biden Administration to meet our commitment to the American people by passing the American Rescue Plan. This relief package is big, bold and includes common-sense provisions the American people overwhelmingly support: Direct checks to families, aid to small businesses, unemployment insurance, funding to reopen schools, prevent essential workers from being laid off, and to boost vaccine distribution.   And the truth is, this virus is having a disproportionate impact on working families and communities of color. For our nation to truly Build Back Better, we can’t leave anyone behind.     I’m fighting everyday to deliver the federal assistance New Jersey families and communities need. Yesterday, the House passed the American Rescue Plan and we will soon take it up the in the Senate. Help is just around the corner!   It was a very busy week, and here’s what else I worked on. 
 

￼
ONE: Path to Citizenship
I officially introduced the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, a bill that brings to life President Biden’s vision for bold, inclusive and humane immigration reform. I believe this is a bill we can all be proud of. It will provide a path to citizenship for the undocumented, keep families together, address the root causes of migration to our southern border, and grow our economy for the benefit of all Americans. Read more about the US Citizenship Act here. 
 
￼
TWO: COVID-19 Questions That Need Answers
They say those who don’t learn from history are doomed to repeat it, which is why I reintroduced bipartisan legislation to create an independent, non-partisan National Coronavirus Commission. This 9/11-style commission will investigate our country’s COVID-19 response and provide recommendations to improve our readiness for future emergencies. We must ensure we never again find ourselves mourning the deaths of over 500,000 Americans. This commission will also help us understand what went wrong, how to prevent it from ever happening again, and provide insight on the racial and economic disparities that the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed and exacerbated. Want to know more about how it works? Check this out. 
 
￼
THREE: No Place Like Home
For many working families, the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic has jeopardized their ability to afford their rent or mortgage. My Coronavirus Housing Counseling Improvement Act is designed to help. This bill will support housing counseling services that have a proven track record of helping homeowners, renters, people experiencing homelessness, and people at risk of homelessness navigate their housing options. Find out more about this bill and share.

2/28/21 18:00,Reminder: Recovery Updates for the Fourth Congressional District,"
 
 

Dear Lindsey,
 
Last week was a trying time for many Texans. We’ve heard the sometimes-deadly stories of families losing heat and power for extended periods. We’ve heard reports of hospitals worried about a lack of water and the potential this shortage had to overwhelm them more than even the Coronavirus.

But we’ve also heard amazing tales of Texans banding together to take care of our own. In the light of this disaster, many of us were brought together as we haven’t been in quite some time. This storm will likely go down in history as the most expensive disaster in Texas history, and as we all rebuild together, I’m hopeful we’ll continue to unite around our shared love of Texas.

I want to email you today to briefly check-in and let you know about the work we’ve done for the citizens of Texas’ Fourth District and provide some resources you may find helpful.

I also want to let you know that Governor Abbott requested that the President include every one of Texas' 254 counties in the Major Disaster Declaration. The President only certified 108 counties. I believe this is a failure in leadership for the most expensive storm in Texas history. I've signed a letter urging President Biden to finish the job as soon as possible, but you can help too. Complete a report with the Texas Department of Emergency Management (TDEM) and give them the critical data needed to secure additional support from Washington. You can also call (844) 844-3089 between 8 am and 8 pm. 

As always, we’re here to help with anything from connecting you with state agencies providing relief on the ground to assisting with your federal disaster relief application. If there’s anything we can do, please call my district office at (972) 771-0100 and we’ll get right on it.

For Texas and Liberty,
 

Pat Fallon, Congressman
House of Representatives

Staying Connected to Our Local Officials

As the disaster was unfolding, we’ve maintained close contact with our state and local officials to track the storm’s progress, damage across the district, and resources available. From working with the Texas Department of Emergency Management (TDEM) and attending their daily briefings, to coordinating with Governor Abbott and our county officials, we’ve made sure to communicate CD4’s needs as they happen.

I've personally been in contact with all 18 county judges, having spoken to most and invited everyone, to discuss the latest developments, get updates from the Texas Department of Emergency Management (TDEM), and answer any questions they’ve been having as we get through this struggle together.


FEMA Disaster Declaration

As of today, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has declared a major disaster in 108 of Texas’ 254 counties. Just this morning, I joined 26 of my colleagues in calling on President Biden and his administration to expand the declaration to every county in our state. Not only would this declaration make much-needed aid available to our citizens to help rebuild, but it would also send a strong message showing the administration’s commitment to ensuring Texans recover. 
 

 

TIART Damage Survey

As the Texas Department of Emergency Management (TDEM) works to assess damage across the state and submit supplemental information to support a more widespread disaster declaration, TDEM is asking all residents to submit damage surveys through the Texas Individual Assistance Reporting Tool (TIART). 

Results from the survey will identify damages across the state to assist emergency management officials to understand needs and plan recovery efforts from the recent winter weather. TDEM Is asking citizens to submit one survey per address.

Results from this survey are critical to getting additional counties included in the disaster declaration as it serves as the basis for damage assessment justifications to FEMA in support of our request for additional assistance.


Disaster Resource Webpage

My staff has assembled a list of resources for the district to help track the federal government’s response efforts, detail available resources from the agencies of Texas, provide information from your local county offices, and more. Is there information you need that you’d like to see added? Just drop my team a message and we’ll get right on it.

2/28/21 20:45,"Black History Month, the American Rescue Plan, and a Survey","￼
 
Dear Friends,  As Black History Month comes to a close today, I wanted to share the roundtable discussion I held last week on the impact of COVID on the Black community. Throughout February, my team and I have had many insightful and productive conversations, and I appreciate these community leaders gathering to share their insight and to discuss actions that communities are taking to address issues like access to vaccines, educational achievement gaps, increased incidence of mental health conditions, and economic well-being.  In this newsletter, you’ll also find an update from Washington and information on the new Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan period.  As the 117th Congress gets underway, I would love to hear from you about the issues you care about most. Please share your thoughts by filling out a quick survey. Hearing from you makes me a better advocate in Congress, and I appreciate your feedback.
Take care and stay safe, 
￼

Black History Month Spotlight: 
COVID-19 Impact and Relief Roundtable
￼
Click to Watch
I hosted a virtual roundtable discussion with Black community leaders focused on the disparate impact of COVID-19 on our communities of color, and how we can most effectively address the barriers that exist in terms of access to healthcare, support, and opportunities for COVID relief.

I was joined by: 
Reverend Dr. Bernadette Glover, St. Paul Baptist Church, Montclair Reverend Dr. Jerry Carter, Calvary Baptist Church, Morristown Reverend Dr. Sidney Williams, Bethel Church of Morristown Dr. Marcheta Evans, President, Bloomfield College Dr. Bette Simmons, Vice President of Student Development and Enrollment Management, County College of Morris Dr. Charlene Gungil, Director, Passaic County Department of Health Dr. Christina Johnson, Atlantic Medical Group, Family Medicine Genaya Palmer, MHA of Essex & Morris Ayo Sanderson Wilson, Founder, Empower the Village Al Pelham, President, Montclair NAACP Rev. Herman Scott, Chaplain, Morris County Correctional Facility
Communities of color continue to be disproportionately impacted by the pandemic in every way imaginable. And these effects will, unfortunately, outlast the pandemic unless we work together to address systemic issues that have long existed and have now been amplified by COVID.
The American Rescue Plan
As I visit communities in North Jersey, the need for additional COVID relief is stark. The House passed the American Rescue Plan this week to provide urgent funding to support vaccine distribution, get children back into schools, and support state and local governments. It will help ensure Americans can pay their bills, stay in their homes, and feed their children. 
Ten million fewer Americans are employed right now compared to before the pandemic – a larger level of job loss than at any point during the Great Recession. We need to provide genuine relief right now because Americans can’t afford years of economic downturn and hardship as a result of the pandemic. Read more about what is in the American Rescue Plan here on my website.
A Moment of Silence For Loved Ones Lost
￼
On Tuesday, I joined my colleagues on the Capitol steps for a moment of silence to remember the 500,000 Americans who have died as a result of coronavirus. Every person we’ve lost is greater than that statistic. They will live on in the memories of those that loved them. I am fighting hard to ensure we get a COVID package signed into law that expands access to testing, vaccines, and PPE while providing support to families, small businesses, and state and local governments that are struggling because of this pandemic. Americans need relief now.

 H.R. 5: The Equality Act
￼
Click to Watch
On Thursday, I voted to pass H.R. 5, the Equality Act, to extend the anti-discrimination protections under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to LGBTQ Americans in housing, education, employment, credit, public accommodation, federal funding, and federal jury service. 
No American should be fired from their job, denied an education, or evicted from their home because of who they are. The Equality Act will ensure equal protection for LGBTQ Americans across the country, following the example we’ve set here in New Jersey. I urge the Senate to send the Equality Act to the president’s desk to deliver this landmark legislation to our LGBTQ community.
SBA PPP Loan Update
On Wednesday, February 24, the SBA opened a fourteen-day PPP loan application period exclusively for small businesses with less than 20 employees.

2/28/21 23:03,Weekly Wrap Up,"￼

Dear Neighbor, 
 
I just concluded a telephone town hall with many of our neighbors discussing their experiences with the Texas Winter Storm.  For those of you who joined, thank you for sharing your time and your story.  I am grateful to hear your thoughts about how to address the many lasting challenges the winter storm brought to light and how I can help you.  My team and I have compiled a list of resources for those who need help in the aftermath of the storm, which you can access here. 
 
In this moment of great need for our community, I am also grateful for the leadership, response, and compassion from all levels of leadership in our community, including President Joe Biden.  I was glad to accompany the President and First Lady in their visit to Houston on Friday and show them the extent of devastation and need, as well as our incredible community that’s working to help get people back on their feet. 
  
￼
  
￼
  
￼
  
We are committed at all levels of government to respond to the immediate and long-term challenges from the winter storm.  I know that a large concern for our community is about bad actors who are willing to take advantage of people who are in need through scams, that’s why this week I called on Federal Trade Commission Acting Chair Rebecca Slaughter to coordinate with local law enforcement to identify, stop, and hold fraudsters accountable during this time. 
 
We are also working to make sure a disaster like this never happens again.  If you haven’t had a chance to respond to our Winter Storm Survey, you can click the link below and send in your thoughts, experiences, and ideas with me.  
  
Share Your Winter Storm Story
  
￼
  
Of course, the winter storm disaster was coupled by another, year-long crisis: the COVID-19 pandemic.  
 
As a part of President Biden’s visit on Friday, we toured the mass vaccination center at NRG Park.  The center at NRG Park is a partnership of federal, state, and local government working together—one that comes at a critical moment for our community and our country.  I was glad to preview the site last Monday with Judge Hidalgo, Mayor Turner, several of my colleagues in our Houston Congressional delegation and other Houston leaders, and to see it in operation on Friday with the President and First Lady during their visit to the site. 
￼
  
The center will vaccinate people using the Harris County and City of Houston vaccination waitlists.  Those 65 and older living in high-risk ZIP codes will have top priority.  People 65 and older, and those 60 and older with chronic health conditions, are also able to sign up.  To register for the county waitlist, visit the vaccination link on ReadyHarris.org or call 832-927-8787.  To register for the City of Houston waitlist, visit the Houston Health Department's NRG Park COVID-19 vaccine waitlist online or by call 832-393-4301.  You can register at both. 
 
The City and County have established a formula to prioritize those at high risk from the waitlists.  In our district, zip code 77036 has been put on the priority list.  
 
This joint federal, state, and local effort to ramp up vaccinations could not come at a more critical time.  More than 500,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 in the last year, including more than 3,000 here in Harris County.  This week, flags flew at half-staff in our country’s Capitol in recognition and mourning of this tragic milestone.  I joined my colleagues there for a candlelight memorial last Tuesday. 
  
￼
  
￼
  
￼
  
The House of Representatives took a major step forward this week in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.  Early Saturday morning, we passed H.R. 1319, The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021.  This legislation implements President Biden’s plan to address both the health and economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
  
￼
  
I was proud to work on key provisions of this legislation as a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee—including the provisions to establish a national vaccination program, expand national testing efforts, ramp up health services for underserved communities, and more.  I am also proud that my bill, the Expand Medicaid Now Act, to incentivize states that have not yet expanded Medicaid (including Texas) to do so passed the House as a part of The American Recue Plan Act. 
 
Key provisions in The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 include:
	•	Providing families an additional direct payment of $1,400 per person—bringing the total relief payment to $2,000 per person in combination with the year-end relief package. 
	•	Making the child tax credit fully refundable and increases its size for 2021. 
	•	Establishing a national COVID-19 vaccination program and increasing vaccinations across the country.  The bill provides more than $20 billion to establish a national COVID-19 vaccination program and improves the administration and distribution of vaccinations. 
	•	Scaling up COVID-19 testing, contact tracing, and mitigation, in order to stop the spread of the virus.  The bill provides $51 billion to expand testing, contact tracing, and mitigation and related activities.
	•	Providing nearly $130 billion to help K-12 schools re-open safely.  The bill makes nearly $130 billion available to states and school districts for immediate and long-term relief so they can work with public health experts to safely re-open schools and make up for lost time in the classroom. 
	•	Helping bridge the digital divide by providing $7.6 billion to expand internet connectivity to students and communities. 
	•	Extending unemployment benefits.  The bill extends the federal supplemental unemployment benefit through August 29 and increases the weekly supplemental benefit from the current $300 per week to $400 per week.
	•	Providing $26 billion for emergency rental assistance to help ensure struggling families continue to have a safe place to live during this pandemic. 
	•	Makomg key investments in food security.  In response to persistent hunger in communities across the country, this bill helps combat increasing food insecurity with key investments in SNAP, WIC, Pandemic EBT and other critical nutrition assistance. 
The House also worked on other key issues this week.  We passed H.R. 803, the Protecting America’s Wilderness and Public Lands Act, legislation to conserve public lands and waters.  We also voted to pass H.R. 5, The Equality Act, to protect our LGBTQ+ neighbors from discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.  I was proud to co-sponsor this legislation. 
￼
I also joined my colleagues in sending several letters to the administration on other important matters, including: 
	•	A letter led to Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack asking for an USDA disaster declaration in Texas; 
	•	A letter to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky requesting that the vaccine distribution formula be corrected so that the most recent census data is used to ensure that the correct doses of vaccines are delivered to the state of Texas; and
	•	A letter to Secretary of State Blinken asking to promote the importance of human rights in the bilateral US-Turkey partnership as the Biden administration engages with President Erdogan's government; 
Our Texas delegation also sent a letter to Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion calling on the credit reporting agencies to not accept nonpayment reports from TX utilities in the ERCOT footprint until issues relating to the high energy costs from the winter storm are addressed.
  
￼
  
In the Energy and Commerce Telecom Subcommittee, we held an important hearing examining the role of traditional media platforms—broadcasters & cable networks—in disseminating disinformation and extremist content to Americans.  You can watch the hearing here. 
 
In the House Science, Space, & Technology Committee, we held a hearing to examine the future of scientific research in the wake of COVID-19, which you can watch here. 
  
￼
  
Happening this week: Staff from our TX-07 district office will be holding virtual pop-up hours on Thursday, March 4 from 4:00-5:30pm to answer your questions about navigating unemployment, the IRS, FEMA, immigration, and other federal agencies!  You can sign up for an appointment here.
  
￼
  
Next Monday, March 8, 2021 at 6:00pm: I am hosting a COVID-19 Telephone Town Hall focused on vaccines.  As Congress and the new administration ramp up vaccine distribution, I want to make sure all your questions are answered.  I will be joined by representatives from the Texas Department of State Health Services and Harris County Public Health. 
 
This town hall was postponed from its original date on February 18, when many of us were out of power or recovering from the Winter Storm.  If you previously submitted an RSVP for this telephone town hall, you are already registered for this one.  If you have not RSVP’d and would like to join, you can SIGN UP HERE to make sure you are on the call.
  
￼
  
At the end of another eventful week, I am proud to represent you, and I am here to help you.  Please do not hesitate to call me to share your thoughts and concerns or to let me know how my team and I can help.  You can email here, or call my office at (713) 353-8680 any time.
 Best wishes,
